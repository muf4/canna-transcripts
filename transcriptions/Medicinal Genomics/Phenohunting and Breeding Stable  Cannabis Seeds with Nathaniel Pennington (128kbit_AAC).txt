[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_01]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you gotten your invitation to CanMed
23 yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, then head over to canmedevents.com
now and request your entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, CanMed 23 is an invitation-only event
this year due to the limited capacity of
[SPEAKER_01]: our new location, the Marriott Marco
Island Beach Resort in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say it's a small event.
[SPEAKER_01]: CanMed 23 will feature three full days of
cannabis science content featuring more
[SPEAKER_01]: than 30 presenters and instructors
representing our key focus areas of
[SPEAKER_01]: science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And new for CanMed 23, we will also
explore psilocybin and psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out all the information at
canmedevents.com now and I hope to see you
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, we talked with Nathaniel
Pennington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nat is the founder and CEO of Humboldt
Seed Company and has been supplying high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality cannabis seed to growers since
2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2018, they hosted the world's largest
phenotype hunt, teaming with local
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers, industry experts, and top
researchers, many of whom are CanMed
[SPEAKER_01]: alumni.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that mega phenotype
project as well as Nat's process for
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding cannabis seeds that are
consistent and reproducible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you growers collaborating with
academics and researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with Nat,
I want to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_01]: Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Founded in 1999, Advanced Nutrients was
the first to develop a complete nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: system that unlocks the true genetic
potential of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since its inception, the brand has
introduced more than 50 innovations to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation community and continues to
revolutionize the space through
[SPEAKER_01]: proprietary scientific discoveries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn more at advancednutrients.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with
[SPEAKER_01]: Nathaniel Pennington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Nat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a pleasure to be here,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a big part of what you do out
there at Humboldt Seed Company to find
[SPEAKER_01]: unique genetics that eventually make it
into your new seed lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, I watched the phenotype mega
hunt video on your website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a project that you did with a
bunch of folks, many of whom are CanMed
[SPEAKER_01]: alumni, which was great to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll put a link to that video in the
show description so people can check it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for those who haven't heard of it or
haven't seen the video, maybe you can
[SPEAKER_01]: describe what you guys did and how it's
different than a typical pheno hunt that
[SPEAKER_01]: you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll give you a little bit of like set
and setting for the impetus for that giant
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go back in time to 2016, 17,
and we had had years of of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in California, of course,
being that we passed that in 1996,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first medical cannabis program
statewide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't have scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have what's needed to supply a
recreational marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were a lot of things about the
fact that we had finally passed a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis bill or it was
actually a voter initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was kind of a little scary because,
you know, Colorado and Oregon had had come
[SPEAKER_00]: after us with medical, but then had
actually gone ahead of us with the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were kind of seeing the
potential to just have kind of monoculture
[SPEAKER_00]: and large scale agricultural practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, I feel like we should
learn from the mistakes of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big monoculture and, you know,
like so that said, we knew what was coming
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to start our recreational
program in the state of California being
[SPEAKER_00]: in Humboldt, which has like, you know,
some of the most deep roots in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably of any place or as deeply rooted
as any place in the world, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one thing that we saw as the
seed company or one of the bigger seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies was like, let's make the best of
this and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the opportunity of scale,
whatever opportunities are there,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's definitely take advantage of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we felt like one of the biggest
opportunities that the scaling presented
[SPEAKER_00]: was the ability to look at, cast a huge
wide net for phenotype analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had already, I have a background in
doing genomics with salmon restoration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a, you know, a big effort in the
North coast and Humboldt County in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, we have rivers that have been,
you know, decimated for the once abundant
[SPEAKER_00]: salmon run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really involved with that working
with, like agricultural school,
[SPEAKER_00]: like UC Davis and their conservation
genomics department.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of would ask around to the
professors and fellow, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people working grad students and whatnot
in labs and just ask what would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing that you would do if you were
in the position like us having a license
[SPEAKER_00]: and having a nursery and having an
established seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: There hasn't been a lot of, there's been a
wonderful amount of work done on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, but it hasn't been able to be
shared publicly because this we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: under prohibition for a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kept hearing over and over again,
well, I'd just look through 10,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd plant 10,000, you know, of as much
diversity as you can possibly get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant it all in big giant fields and just
go and hunt through for what really speaks
[SPEAKER_00]: to the needs of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of started wrapping my mind
around what it would take to do that and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and realize that it was actually possible
as long as we did it really
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboratively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in 2016 and 17, we just kind of
were establishing partnerships with farms
[SPEAKER_00]: that were likely to have a big scale out
and have a lot of acreage come the first
[SPEAKER_00]: year of recreational in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so partnering up with, I think five
farms at the end of the day, not including
[SPEAKER_00]: our two facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all in all around seven locations,
we actually got up to the 10,000 plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark that we wanted to be able to look at
over the course of a summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all genetics that were,
you know, following suggestions that were
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to be fairly diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, first generation poly
hybrid type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the, the really fun part of it
was, you know, who decides what's the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the greatest of all, or not even just the
greatest, but who even decides what are
[SPEAKER_00]: the in the top one or 5% of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a good point too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you were doing this, did you have
sort of a, a prototype type plant that you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to discover, or was it,
Hey, let's just plant this all and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and kind of where we were going,
we did have a phenotype rating system that
[SPEAKER_00]: we had developed several years before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we published that on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've published it in a few other,
you know, kind of open cannabis research,
[SPEAKER_00]: internet sites, but, and so we tried to
share it around and it's still available
[SPEAKER_00]: on our website under the learn section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the, the ideal phenotype to me
was, was what this broad diverse of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that were in involved in the industry,
even all the way down to a bud tender at a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary who sees a lot of people coming
through and what they're asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you mentioned a lot of like
alumni for can med and, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: probably people that have been speakers at
your guys's events ended up being the
[SPEAKER_00]: invitees and whether they did the Fino
hunt with us and then went on to do can
[SPEAKER_00]: med or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure there was a lot of overlap,
but basically we, we wanted to have other
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, geneticists, we wanted to have
dispensary owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had lab technicians or, or even people
developing laboratory equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have bud tenders and we had other
farmers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a lot of other farmers,
of course, cause we were working with all
[SPEAKER_00]: these farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all wanted to go along on the
tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, of course, the rating system that
we developed kind of helps to guide what
[SPEAKER_00]: might get selected into the top
percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in doing that, basically like our,
our phenotype rating system is built out
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that, that it's numeric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can put it into something like
an access database and then query out
[SPEAKER_00]: features or traits that you're looking for
in, in a plan, even down to something like
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, right now it just so happens
that purple cannabis has become trendy
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of always, of course,
being a cannabis breeder, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, we kind of pay attention to the
trends, but we don't let them dictate our
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but we, we might plan on making more
purple cannabis seeds this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know that that's something
that's popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how, how easy is it to sort of adapt
to different trends?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I imagine it's got to take,
you know, a good amount of time to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: pheno hunt, to find the, you know,
the good genetics and then to sort of have
[SPEAKER_01]: a stable set of seeds too, that's going to
give you a consistent phenotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how, how quickly can you sort of,
you know, address the changes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, if you do massive phenohunts
every year and hold on to as many of these
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse types that speak to people in,
you know, to a diverse group of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: including yourself, and, you know,
you can't just let your own opinions
[SPEAKER_00]: totally rule your decision-making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got it, you know, and that's
been the wonderful thing about us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also kind of our cross to bear,
let's just say, but we've got so many
[SPEAKER_00]: years of built up genetics in,
whether it's in storage in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: germ prep, plasm, that's like,
you know, kept in our climate controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: seed cooler area, or whether it's actually
still kept as a clone from a phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: hunt or in tissue culture or so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, we've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a trend happens, you know,
you, you're dealing with what you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: your own, essentially your own breeding
line, which, which makes a huge difference
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you just pick up a clone that's
happens to fit the bill, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's purple and it produces a lot and it
tests pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, is this, if it's not a,
at all, like a pure bred line,
[SPEAKER_00]: then as soon as you try to do any breeding
with it, it's just going to produce this
[SPEAKER_00]: vast array of phenotypic variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you're much,
much better off like having even just germ
[SPEAKER_00]: plasm that's been stored or seeds for
those that, and seeds that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: stored for even five or 10 years,
because it hasn't been popular recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all of a sudden, you know,
blueberry smelling cannabis becomes widely
[SPEAKER_00]: popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can just kind of pull that out
and, and there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's any serious breeder should be
thinking about creating stable lines for,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like your toolbox as a real
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, if you're just going with random
clones that you get out of, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a great way to start a breeding
program, but that's like literally step
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is having like a good clone that you find
from a phenotype hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I think a lot of people
don't understand is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we started doing these big phenotype hunts
many years ago and keeping clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then it's really the beginning of the
process because before, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you should release anything to the
public or before you can, the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I try to get through people's minds
is like you to have something that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: real breedable line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should produce repeatable results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you could, you should be able to
take one seed and grow a plant out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and cross it with whatever, if you're
making a hybrid seed or if you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: an inbred line and have it produce a batch
of seeds that, that are both uniform and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you could go back and take
another seed from the same population,
[SPEAKER_00]: perform that same experiment and have
fairly similar or the same result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of just like the basis of
all sciences that essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look at making a cross of a
cannabis cross as, as an experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not really, you're not finding out
any result unless you can do that again
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a similar result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, like if we cross this,
you know, Nepalese type cannabis that got
[SPEAKER_00]: these wonderful features with this older
variety that's been grown in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica for the last 100 years,
then you get this amazing turpentine and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those kinds of discoveries can only happen
when you have a relative relatively pure
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how hard is it, how hard is it to get
to that pure line?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cause you've obviously in most
cases have to start with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, very heterozygous type plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how difficult is it to sort of get it
to a place where it's pure and it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be creating, you know, repeatable seeds
and that when you, when you're crossing
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it's going to give you a sort of
repeatable result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really, really great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a lot to do with how
heterozygous or homozygous the plant might
[SPEAKER_00]: be when you start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you did, let's just say happened
to find a seed, you know, an accession or
[SPEAKER_00]: a group of seeds that came from an
isolated area, people are calling like
[SPEAKER_00]: land race seeds that have for the most
part just been bred within that population
[SPEAKER_00]: and selected for let's say, you know,
10 years or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that just kind of like a naturally
going to be naturally fairly homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're kind of jumping ahead,
but then again, the negative of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, when we've done that and
gone like, you know, into the deep end
[SPEAKER_00]: into the interior of Jamaica and found,
you know, the Jamaican lamb's bread,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, the propensity for
hermaphroditic traits was incredibly high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was like a lot of non commercial
type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really more often than not,
you're probably working with, with more
[SPEAKER_00]: modern cannabis types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to that is anywhere from I
would say four to eight generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends on how you're doing it,
whether you're selfing a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is basically, you know, taking a
clone of the genetically identical plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and reversing the sex of it, you know,
which is essentially just how we make
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you you take away the the hormone
ethylene or its its effect that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally produces, you block it,
and then it goes to to make male organs
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than female organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the the chromosomes in the pollen
granules are female.
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing that, you can make a self
pollinated cannabis plant, which really
[SPEAKER_00]: would not normally happen in nature
because cannabis is a, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: a diecious plant, meaning that it has a
male, separate male flower on a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and a female flower on a separate
plant, as opposed to most plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: monicious where they can pollinate
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not to say that all plants are
pollinating themselves all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of, you know, bees,
obviously, are doing their share of the
[SPEAKER_00]: work and cannabis is wind pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to compare corn where you have
the tassels are the male parts of the corn
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and then the silk is the female
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably there's a lot of self
pollination, of course, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: tassels are right above.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a cornfield, there's probably also,
you know, there's wind and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that that blow that pollen certainly over
to adjacent plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but back to cannabis, we can self
pollinate cannabis now with you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: through the methods that we've,
you know, figured out with with the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sex reversal and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really fast way to get to
full homozygosity or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more, much more uniform and purebred
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of started calling them purebred
lines more and more because people just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of cringe at the inbred line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But inbred line is really the term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in plant breeding, it's not it's not
really a bad thing, especially when you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that the goal is to have a highly
inbred line and then find something that
[SPEAKER_00]: is really I would like to say like a
heterotic or just really mix as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also an inbred line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what a true hybrid seed is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you have uniformity and
heterosis or otherwise known as hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like the holy grail of
of all seeds for agriculture purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the corn that we all,
you know, like the sweet corn that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting out right now just for our
little kitchen garden is there 100 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be hybrid seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something that we're all
striving.
I think many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis seed companies that are more have
a little bit more of a scientific slant to
[SPEAKER_00]: them are are working on that, because it
will certainly be make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only growing cannabis easier,
but it'll make a.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, more repeatable experiments,
which is kind of what we were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about before where.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so going back to this mega phenol hunt
that you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the conclusion of it, you've
identified how many different,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sort of standouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what's the next step after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we really only kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: One percent and it and with even the goal
was to keep less than one percent because.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even one percent of 10% thousand is is a
heck of a lot of plants to have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, turn into mother plants or
preserve with tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so with the one percent that we
did keep, we put a lot of those into
[SPEAKER_00]: different growing environments like indoor
grows, mixed light growing and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: just.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, share them back with our
community and, you know, we immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: did release a few things as clones and
then very quickly started breeding those
[SPEAKER_00]: for seed like a seed line stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I know that some plant breeders
would shake their head at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're not we still do
release some of our purebred lines to the
[SPEAKER_00]: public because.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the best product that we have
right now in the cannabis space for people
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to grow with seed and still
have product like still have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the biggest things that we
think because we sell seeds at retail,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, for like hobbyists and people that
want to grow their own medicine and.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just a lot more accessible and
they're actually a lot more vigorous and.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of respects, there, I think,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cleaner way of growing cannabis
because you don't have pests and pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: that can come with clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all seeing the hoplite and viroid
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's sweeping across the
industry and devastating and and hoplite
[SPEAKER_00]: and viroid doesn't really even transmit
through seed very much, if at all.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, it's a much better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that we haven't done the real
breeding work to make the seeds produce
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that and if we're going to say
something has, you know, this amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and this amount of THC or it should
have a smell that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry muffin is one of our more famous
ones that people like or it finishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the flowering time is this that
or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to really be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that you can't have
unless you make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population's uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whether that means kind of sharing
what I think most seed breeders would
[SPEAKER_00]: consider their sort of intellectual
property, we've kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Said to ourselves, well, look,
this is what the the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_00]: needs, and we know that we're giving away
some of our IP, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, good luck trying to do what we
do, because it's it's actually like really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for now, we're like, you want to
follow in our footsteps, like go for it
[SPEAKER_00]: and good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially considering that,
like as the developer of many of these
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is it a real challenge for us to
maintain so many and constantly be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, generation after generation and
selection and all that, but how would how
[SPEAKER_00]: would someone else know what to select
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what phenotypic expressions that to
kind of like queue in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just jumping in, you know, say we're
releasing something that's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, eight generations in of
selection and breeding, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to jump in and and know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be as familiar with that plant as.
[SPEAKER_00]: As like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our extended team that we've got is is
familiar with it, and it's it's just would
[SPEAKER_00]: be impossible to.
[SPEAKER_00]: To know what you're even looking at,
and that's I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a beautiful thing about
cannabis that it rewards people that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That love it and have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a lot of interaction with it and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you see people like Allison
Justice that maybe haven't been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite as have had quite like the longevity
of Humboldt seed company, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or definitely not afraid to get their
hands dirty and are jumping right into,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, being out there in the field
and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Observing how the plants grow and doing a
lot of you know, tons of testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% in the lab or, you know, a little bit
of consumption mixed with the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do both, you know, and I think
both are valuable, but I think that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of important to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be out there year after year and I
mean, I'm sure that she would.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were to give her a call right now and.
[SPEAKER_00]: And say, you know, have you do you learn
something new and an incredibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eye opening every single year,
you know, since like the fino hunt and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where she came out and so many people came
out and got a chance to just see fields
[SPEAKER_00]: and fields of cannabis like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that they had never even
imagined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going and doing that themselves
now for four years with with hemp and in
[SPEAKER_00]: different climates and in different
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee you Allison would be like
every single year I learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the plant just blows my mind,
so it's it's something that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just jump in, you know,
with and think that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, what I'm not my good
friends K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a PhD plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: She graduated from UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's worked in cannabis now for two or
three years and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: She teach she has a lot to teach me,
but I would venture to say that she has
[SPEAKER_00]: probably, you know, called me up for
advice about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how the cannabis plants going to
react to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, breeding strategy versus the
other breeding strategy more more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're seeing this great mix of
academia and.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience the knowledge and it's it's
going to do the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to do us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some favors and start to accelerate things
a lot and.
[SPEAKER_00]: This people 100% minded though you know
people have to people from the old
[SPEAKER_00]: industry space has have to be open minded
to you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: To traditional breeding practices and even
you know marker assisted breeding and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's going to take a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for people to be open to gene
editing and GMO and I'm not I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: endorsing that I don't think we need that
right now at all and so there's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much work that can be done
with the tactics that we've used for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 100 years in humanity that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can apply to cannabis before we would
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Need to jump into that space, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, no matter what, it's probably
it's probably helpful that the plant so
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not so much that we need to
necessarily edit in tricks from other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that to apply to cannabis where you
know we could hopefully just find it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the diverse genetics that are already out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know one of the greatest one
of the things that's that really gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: another boost of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excitement about what I do was starting to
work with the.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we call auto flowering or root around
us is sort of the and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started about 8 years ago just toying
with it and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, getting some seeds from over in
Europe where it actually kind of had been.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more common and popular than
in the United States and just saying to
[SPEAKER_00]: myself like I see what this is all about
because.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've heard mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stories and.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, first hand, you know
that's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is something that like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you really gotta just like I
said, get your get your fingers dirty and
[SPEAKER_00]: get in there to really know so got these
rural seeds was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a few years to figure out some of
the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuances like how they're very sensitive to
the early two or first two or three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put into a, you know, I think the best way
in the long run, the best way to grow out
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower is going to be to direct seed
them in in fields or or into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pots or whatever, wherever you're growing
media is just to get them directly put in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and I think the seeds need to be a
little bit cheaper before people are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: On people like me to help make it more
reasonable, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they need to be if they get root
bound at all, even the slightest bit of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constriction, then they'll go right into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, there is so many
advantages of of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type of cannabis and what I learned
quickly was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is kind of back to like the
editing gear, not GMO, but just like
[SPEAKER_00]: something like crisper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't need that tool, but what I
realized was that you can through three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four or four or five generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, for all intensive purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut the trait of auto flowering,
so you know, no matter what, I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay attention to the day length and
flower in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you know, I'm going to be finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say finished flowering after
two and a half to three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a ruderalis cannabis, and you can
cut that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And paste it into any of the popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period types or or rare cannabinoid
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG, CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done it personally with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCV, but but.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is, is that it doesn't have
baggage and a lot of people assume that
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be you know, low THC or it's going to have
a loose flower that doesn't look good
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to be, you know, sold commercially
or.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're restricted to a certain set of
cannabinoids and and I just have found
[SPEAKER_00]: none of that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so that's been kind of a.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as you said, like cannabis is
diverse and look at this like lo and
[SPEAKER_00]: behold, someone who had been breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a cannabis Mecca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could find this new trait that just you
know, one of the big things for me is like
[SPEAKER_00]: so many people are utilizing the light
deprivation techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make their cannabis flower more quickly
in an outdoor setting, and I was always
[SPEAKER_00]: just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distraught about the amount of plastic
that was being.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on this earth through through that,
and I mean, we're guilty of it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We utilize light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that we're above that or
anything, but it I just knew that hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a way that we can have nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do this for us and.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows people in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Areas that you know, like up in Canada,
we had a lot of demand for our auto for
[SPEAKER_00]: flower genetics there because.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they have such a grow short
growing season that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that was just wonderful for them
to have something that you know it's great
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to plant something and then
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I'm going to have a plant
that we're going to be harvesting at and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with photo photo period,
cannabis sure we know when we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be harvesting it, but it's always going to
be in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it right choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, farmers can plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not having to sacrifice the
traits that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have come to know and love in
in the photo period type of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was just like a whole nother set of
work that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, of course, as a plant breeder,
you're.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big job is actually kind of sometimes
what what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it gets you re inspired and and
so that for us was was inspiring,
[SPEAKER_00]: but but of course we haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changed our program of just whether it's
photo period or auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally just exploring this incredibly
diverse species and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the on untold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vast uses that are that we're discovering
all the time it's and you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are really a big contributor to the
understanding and exploration of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate every, you know,
every paper that you put out or.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, conferences and networking
events, and it's just a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect all the people that are so
interested in this and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a it's a diverse it's a diverse
problem, and it's going to take all of us
[SPEAKER_01]: in our different areas of expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: To kind of push us forward, and that's one
of the, you know, one of the reasons we
[SPEAKER_01]: love doing can meds, because we get to
bring together the growers, the
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers, the doctors, the industry
people and everybody to kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to figure out, you know how we how we
move this thing forward, and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things you mentioned earlier was,
you know, one of the things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: highlighted at the last can med with a
group from humble actually sort of talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marrying the experience of the folks who
have had the hands on experience with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants with the academics who are,
you know, researching the plants now and
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, finding the scientific reasons
for what you guys may have already
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered and sort of, you know,
bringing that information to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a really, really
important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming you're talking about like
Daniel Hendricks and then Doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are some of my best friend
Lele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that those their pioneers here in
Humboldt and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doc is just another breeder that has been
around even well before my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody that I have a lot of respect
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're absolutely right, you know,
it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing the the academia and you know,
this world that has existed for so long,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't discredit it because.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whether or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were outlaws at a time and whether
we're still outlaws in the eyes of of
[SPEAKER_00]: some, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And has been a plant that's been a plant
that's been appreciated by humanity and
[SPEAKER_00]: and and a useful plant for since the
beginning, you know, time immemorial,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just say.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no denying that that it's
thankfully finally coming into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, out of the the sort of darkness
and clandestine world that it was in and
[SPEAKER_00]: and.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heck, yeah, let's merge together all
these skills and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capabilities and and I think, you know,
circling back to the the phenotype mega
[SPEAKER_00]: hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Hendrick's team, they were big
involved with that whole project and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that that maybe was like one of
the.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier attempts at.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of a gathering and a meeting of
the minds and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, gosh, I can't deny that just
being close to universities like UC Davis
[SPEAKER_00]: and and even what's now called Cal Poly
Humboldt used to be Humboldt State,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a polytechnic.
[SPEAKER_00]: University now part of Cal Poly's program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of potential for us,
but and we've been able to use and utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: that those resources there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, I don't know if I should even admit,
but sometimes more, you know, in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of sneaky way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And universities can touch hemp and they
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, you know, do some sequencing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some sequencing work,
whether it was technically hemp or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's maybe save that for.
[SPEAKER_00]: When when we're all laughing about how
silly the laws were in 30 years,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, doing stuff with the
universities is just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the normal AG and plant breeding world,
that's so commonplace, and it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: critical to being able to, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of foster a young generation of
people that are educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In.
[SPEAKER_00]: In plant breeding or a skill or trade or
what whatever and and doing it in in a
[SPEAKER_00]: real setting that is like the essentially
a business that has, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: an economic future and a value,
and we can't do that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do it well, let's just say at
least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot still needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're appreciate we're glad that we're
close to UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just tell you that and we're already
developing as many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connections and and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, gathering as much information as
we can and, you know, Humboldt seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it shocks a lot of people that
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, self capitalize and we don't
have a massive research budget,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when we do have budgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That and we we do put spend a lot of money
on doing R and D and research and.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen kind of some of the pitfalls of
taking on massive investment and having,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, having the folks that
essentially lent you money breathing down
[SPEAKER_00]: your neck and saying, you know,
well, look, I don't care about what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing to make the plant better for five
years from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we need to get out of the red today
and you need to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our money now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our money now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that I mean, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are lucky stars that we've been able
to navigate without having to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, every day we wake up at
Humboldt seed company and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: To, you know, make this plant more
accessible and better and more consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, discover unique, diverse,
useful types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just a great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mission to have when we wake up in the
morning and it's all been very organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all been, you know, through
connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just introductions from someone
like Alice and Justice having.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common participated in one of our female
hunts and.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think earlier, like you asked how we're
keeping up with that and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the 10,000 plant hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did another substantial hunt the next
year and then we really started to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effects of COVID.
Were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely made for some of the smaller
hunts that we ever had, so I think in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2021 we didn't have quite as vast of a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population to look through just because we
really weren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, going from farm to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially spreading COVID and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year we've maintained at least like
looking through 3000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year we're looking through 5000
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually more because we've got our.
[SPEAKER_00]: Facilities over in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's the biggest thing tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to a farm called Casa floor,
which is an outdoor farm in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: County, so I'll drive from here where I am
and humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: At our what I call our anchor farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive down there with the film crew and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Revisit Casa floor because, of course,
to do the way that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It and this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly labor intensive, but we go and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take all of the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetative cuttings or clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off every single plant down there and
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Store them keep them in veg and just
essentially just kind of keep them alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until they're.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially about ready to harvest,
and so we then go and return.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be our return visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Casa floor and do our whole rating
system and I think this time tomorrow
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have a video crew and then we've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our European team is visiting this week,
so we're taking them with us to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some rating and analysis and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the folks there at Casa floor are
going to be obviously out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the field with us because.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it works is we'll give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds that we have interest in exploring
so like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds for exploration and and that's not
so much the ones that are always
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially available to people because
those ones are you know we've taken the
[SPEAKER_00]: time to make them uniform and consistent
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage for somebody like Casa floor
is for one thing they do a lot of fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen extract so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said it's not as detrimental to
have some diversity in a population when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fresh frozen extract because it
essentially you're homogenizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: population so it kind of averages out the
phenotypic variation which is which is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of great like does it gives you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of what the the cross or what the
population created.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an average when you sort of mix it
together so from.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a chemo type perspective we'll find
out what that cross produced on average
[SPEAKER_00]: and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course then we'll go and use the
opportunity in collaboration with Lou and
[SPEAKER_00]: the team at Casa floor to find unicorns we
call them or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype hunt winners within each
individual group that we shared with them
[SPEAKER_00]: to to hunt and.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some give and take like we kind
of often provide those seeds free of
[SPEAKER_00]: charge as R and D populations and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some trust that we have developed
with the team there that you know they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take good care and allow us to
come and take the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissue samples or the you know the clones
basically and we have to tag every single
[SPEAKER_00]: plant individually and so we have to know
that those tags are all going to be there
[SPEAKER_00]: and be attached to the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initial you know the the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not you know goofed around or whatever and
so that's that's a relationship or a
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership and what they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back is they get some.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cool video like if you folks want to
check out other phenotype hunt videos
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a great Casa floor phenotype hunt
video on our website right now as well
[SPEAKER_00]: from last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and they get exposure but also they'll
have access like the one of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that we picked from last year's phenotype
hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casa floor is doing an entire clone
propagated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a small field of that plant in
particular and we're going to go and look
[SPEAKER_00]: at that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like the instant
gratification that you can get from
[SPEAKER_00]: finding you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: A unicorn or an amazing phenome is that
you can just turn around and and the next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will often offer it back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whoever whatever farm it was and say
hey you know if you want go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate the crap out of this and then
you'll have kind of almost an exclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Market for this new thing that we've found
the year before but the seeds themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't put those out more often than not
it takes us two years to really feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable sharing those after we find a
phenome because you know that's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can often get at least two generations
in a year and so you know it may be four
[SPEAKER_00]: generations later before we really feel
like it's ready to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in the market as a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you know and that's four generations
of of self thing right because you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a male to to breed with
right right yeah and that's kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing now but it's selfing with
selection in between and this is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like now I'm sharing some trade secrets
and I'm probably most people would say
[SPEAKER_00]: you've already shared a ton of them on
this interview but but here's one that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one that actually I feel like is
not common knowledge or if you picked up a
[SPEAKER_00]: book or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know when you sell something it's
makes a massive difference how homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: or heterozygous it was in the first place
so if you sell something that's just like
[SPEAKER_00]: a random clone that is you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea what really the
background is like somebody might just say
[SPEAKER_00]: this is cookies times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Runs or whatever the heck and and all of
those things are really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very heterozygous if you were to do like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know an analysis of of how much very
much of a variation they're capable of
[SPEAKER_00]: producing and and so if you take that
clone and and you start your project with
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to the selfing is going
to create just a huge array of because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're really going to see what's going to
come out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self pollination is grandma and
great-grandpa and you know like just the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole family tree is going to all of a
sudden come back out which can be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: useful for certain strategies and breeding
actually it's kind of neat but but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not specifically moving you a big step
towards uniformity or homozygosity it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had done so sell things not like it's
not going to those seeds that result from
[SPEAKER_01]: selfing aren't like a for all intents and
purposes a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the mother it's no not just as diverse
yeah it may be it may.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes in some cases it can even be a
little bit more diverse but it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: step in the right direction and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what what the process for us it's
what's really important is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There I mean there are situations where
we've been doing sibling crosses for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years we already have a fairly homozygous
line or maybe it's something that came
[SPEAKER_00]: from a specific part of the world that was
isolated like a land race and so the
[SPEAKER_00]: selfing of something like that is not
going to split the Adam open and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of diversity but selfing something
that's probably you know part of one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern super high you know like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poly hybrids that are just kind of like
that will create a bunch of diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not to say that that's not a good
way to start making a more purebred line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just when you do that know that
you're going to have to self and then do a
[SPEAKER_00]: female hunt afterwards to find and the
purpose of that female hunt afterwards
[SPEAKER_00]: would be to find the ones that are
expressing the most similarity to the prop
[SPEAKER_00]: the.
[SPEAKER_00]: For general yeah that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically have the clone you've
selfed it now you look through the project
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're looking for something that
resembles that progenitor clone or the
[SPEAKER_00]: original and so you know the assumption is
that that one has a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygosity that it inherited because of
its uniformity and that could not be
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily true but for what's important
to us which is like phenotypic expression
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid chemotypic expression it's
probably the case so then then you take
[SPEAKER_00]: that and now you're going to self that one
and and so that would be an s2 generation
[SPEAKER_00]: and now you're going to start seeing a
much much more uniformity in the progeny
[SPEAKER_00]: and but still you know if you had to do a
female hunt for the s1 and it was vast and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was diverse you're probably going to
have to do a female hunt for the s2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: then now when you get further and further
and here's the interesting part that is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would consider a little trade
secret is there's a point in which you
[SPEAKER_00]: have so much uniformity and we're at this
point with quite a few of our lines now
[SPEAKER_00]: and that these aren't necessarily things
that we're sharing now with the world
[SPEAKER_00]: because it actually starts to become
deleterious to you know you're having
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's too inbred to share it in
and of itself you're but you're on well on
[SPEAKER_00]: the path to making a true breeding hybrid
seed now but the interesting thing is you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't you do selection maybe but the
selection is actually if you look for the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest healthiest happiest plant you're
actually probably not picking the most
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous plant and and this is where
doing sequencing and looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygosity can be helpful and you know
definitely it's kind of like a marker
[SPEAKER_00]: assisted breeding it's not exactly a
marker but you know finding out which one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the progeny is the most homozygous and
then moving forward with that ironically
[SPEAKER_00]: though it's not you've now I'd say once
you get to like s4 s5 you're no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for the most vigorous healthiest
plant because that is likely the most
[SPEAKER_00]: hetero as I got the most heterozygous
plant and so it's a weird switch that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do and it's also around that time
where you're switching from like this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I would personally want to
grow like if I was a farmer to like no
[SPEAKER_00]: this is something that I'm moving towards
being a highly inbred line that is now
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make a true hybrid seed and so
that's like oftentimes we'll just sprout a
[SPEAKER_00]: tray of s4 type seeds and look for the
ones that looks just like not the the most
[SPEAKER_00]: mutated one or the most terrible one but
certainly no longer are we trying to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: the best it's just like you have to start
picking the ones that are average or true
[SPEAKER_00]: to to form and and yeah you know because
you're working against all right now I
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta let you go yeah I just keep giving
away so much more than 15 minutes I gotta
[SPEAKER_01]: let you go but before I let you go I want
to give you a chance to plug any social
[SPEAKER_01]: media websites resources I know you've
mentioned a few during our conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: but now's a good time to kind of bring
those up and I will put links to them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the show description as well yeah we have
our website we also have a YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course we have the classic cannabis
Instagram account that kind of is always
[SPEAKER_00]: in danger of potentially getting turned
off but the website and the YouTube are
[SPEAKER_00]: really great and stable so
Humboldtseedcompany.com and YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel is just Humboldt seed company and
our Instagram is the Humboldt seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Humboldt seed company and thank you
so much for having me on and yeah sorry
[SPEAKER_00]: about all the tangents but no it I love
talking about this no no it's been a
[SPEAKER_01]: pleasure and we appreciate you sharing
some trade secret secrets with us and we
[SPEAKER_00]: hope to see you out at a Can Med event
would be great to catch up yes I know I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been meaning and wanting to go for several
years now so I'm gonna be there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: bet on it I'll be in touch with you about
that all right thanks again thank you man
