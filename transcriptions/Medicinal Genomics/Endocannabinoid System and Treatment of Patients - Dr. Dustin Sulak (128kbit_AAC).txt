[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great conference so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my honor to present to you a little
bit of what I've learned over the last six
[SPEAKER_00]: years in Maine practicing cannabinoid
medicine on the front lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just an overview of the next 20
minutes, an introduction to my work,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then some of what I've discovered
about cannabinoid dosing nuances,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the nonlinear dose response,
sensitization and tolerance, bidirectional
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, and then I want to talk a little
bit about acidic cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I've been seeing some great results
with in my practice, and then I'll end
[SPEAKER_00]: with three pediatric seizure cases and
kind of the theme of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Integrate is the name of my clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started in Manchester, Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have three practices, two in Maine,
one here in Burlington, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with about 16 other medical
providers, and together we take care of at
[SPEAKER_00]: least 18,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think it's closer to 20,000
patients now.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all real patients with real
medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not in the business of providing
certifications for personal adult use,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I don't think prohibition is a
very good public health policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to medical cannabis,
we practice good medicine, integrative
[SPEAKER_00]: family medicine, osteopathy, which is one
of my loves and specialties, functional
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, mind-body medicine, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the age demographic of our
practice, so it's mostly adult patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Maine, we have distinct qualifying
conditions for which we can certify a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient to use cannabis, and so here's the
basic demographic, about 72% chronic pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13% PTSD, and there's certainly an overlap
of people that have comorbid PTSD with
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic pain, and then the rest is pretty
much a big mix of many other conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a clinician, it's an incredible
honor to be in a practice where I see such
[SPEAKER_00]: a variety of pathology, and I get to apply
all my skills and what I can learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: the primary research and from my clinical
experience to help different patients with
[SPEAKER_00]: different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll back up for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: About two or three years ago, with some of
the documentaries on CNN, parents started
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to me requesting that I treat their
children with cannabinoids for various
[SPEAKER_00]: neurologic conditions, and at the time,
I was basically faced with, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the clinicians in the room could probably
appreciate this, a mom holding up a bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: of Tincture and saying, how many drops of
this should I be giving to my child,
[SPEAKER_00]: which puts a clinician like myself in a
very uncomfortable position.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in that bottle?
[SPEAKER_00]: How potent is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did our best to start tested labs,
and I believe that we're the only medical
[SPEAKER_00]: practice in the world that does
cannabinoid medicine and has in-house
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics of the medicine that patients
are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows us to discover new things
about what's working and what's not
[SPEAKER_00]: working, and also to really fine-tune the
dosing, and understand what's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're making new discoveries all the
time, and some of our best discoveries
[SPEAKER_00]: come from people's mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the words of someone I admire a lot,
Bob Ross, the TV painter with the Afro,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said, there's no mistakes, there's just
happy little accidents, and the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that we can do is learn a whole lot
from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, in cannabinoid medicine,
that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: These substances are so safe and nontoxic
that even gross errors are typically safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can learn a whole lot from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really wonderful to be
experimenting clinically with something
[SPEAKER_00]: with this type of safety profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to show you, morphologically,
some of these medicines can look exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same, but have vastly different
therapeutic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a flower that's mostly THC
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have another one that's about half
and half THC and CBD, and here we have
[SPEAKER_00]: another one that's almost all CBD and no
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the people in this room that aren't
actually handling the plants, please know
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't tell by looking at it or
smelling it what effect it's going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: on someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need the analytics to look at
the medicine and understand what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also solving some of the biggest
problems we had practicing cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, I came out with Healer.com,
which is a patient education website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike other types of medicine with
cannabis, I can't tell a patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: here, take 10 milligrams three times a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be able to say that as a starting
dose, but really, cannabinoid medicine is
[SPEAKER_00]: highly individualized, and a lot of it
needs dose titration and feedback with a
[SPEAKER_00]: provider, and most clinicians don't have
the time to do that with their patients
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't have the experience that I had
that allowed me to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on Healer.com, we have programs to take
someone who's never used cannabis before,
[SPEAKER_00]: who doesn't even know what it is,
and walk them through it, kind of hold
[SPEAKER_00]: their hand and introduce them to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have programs to take existing users
who are maybe using it recreationally and
[SPEAKER_00]: want to start using it to promote health,
using it medically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switching from inhalation to tincture,
non-psychoactive strategies, and other
[SPEAKER_00]: programs that can help patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free, so I invite you to check out
Healer.com and share it with your family,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, and patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Maine has a wonderful medical cannabis
program, one of the best in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 13 indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to see more, but all the major
indications are on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: MDs, DOs, and MPs are allowed to certify.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have eight dispensaries and over 2,000
caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homegrow is allowed, which I like people
can grow outdoors in the summer and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially produce enough medicine to
last them the whole year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donations are allowed, so if a patient or
a caregiver has surplus, they can give it
[SPEAKER_00]: away freely without an exchange of value,
which is quite nice for the altruistic
[SPEAKER_00]: type of feeling that we get with cannabis
in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out-of-state reciprocity, so we have a lot
of patients from Massachusetts coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: Maine to access our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting mainstream referrals from the
medical community all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four pediatric neurologists in the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all sending me their toughest
cases, and we have a collaborative
[SPEAKER_00]: grassroots activism environment,
and I just want to thank people like
[SPEAKER_00]: Katherine Lewis from Medical Marijuana
Caregivers of Maine and Glenn Peterson,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in the front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are fellow Mainers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work together to create this good
program, and that type of collaboration is
[SPEAKER_00]: essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dosing by the milligram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found in my practice that,
for the most part, the effective oral
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing range goes from .05 milligrams per
kilogram per day all the way up to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per kilogram per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be like someone my body size
taking three milligrams of cannabinoids a
[SPEAKER_00]: day and doing well versus taking,
you know, 1,700 or maybe even 2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say it doesn't make a lot of sense
to dose adults by body weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: These compounds do go to the nervous
system, and I think our nervous systems
[SPEAKER_00]: all have pretty similar weights,
but in pediatrics, we certainly need
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is such a broad dosing range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't see this with other
medications, but we're still in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: safe range.
[SPEAKER_00]: As some of you know, researchers have
tried to kill animals with high doses of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, and they simply haven't been able to
do it, including at, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 times the dose that I'm seeing in my
practice at the high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little pointer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've also observed is this
bifurcation or nonlinear dose response
[SPEAKER_00]: curve, where if someone starts at a low
dose of cannabinoids, whether it's THC or
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, and this isn't every case,
but a lot of cases follow this trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they titrate up, they'll get increased
efficacy up to a certain point,
[SPEAKER_00]: and beyond that point, they'll start to
lose efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone seems to have somewhat of an
optimal dose, and I can't tell an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual what their optimal dose will
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have to find that out for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of recommending a dosage,
I recommend a method or methodology for
[SPEAKER_00]: how to find your optimal dosage,
and that seems to work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of our existing cannabis
users come here, and what we do for them
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually reduce their dose so that they
can increase efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, they're saving money and
reducing side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is well known in the animal research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a study on locomotor activity
in rats giving THC, and you can see from
[SPEAKER_00]: the baseline, a very low dose of THC,
.2 milligrams per kilogram, actually
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased their activity level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as the dose increased, activity level
went up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as the dose increased again,
activity level went down again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a triphasic dose
response curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is that at these higher
doses, five milligrams per kilogram,
[SPEAKER_00]: they weren't actually seeing the same
efficacy at these ultra-low doses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they were seeing the emergence of a
side effect, in this case, catalepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is remaining still in an unusual
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see this with my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get efficacy at higher doses,
but often at lower doses, we get better
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy with less side effects,
and I believe that not many people in this
[SPEAKER_00]: field are dosing as low as I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also well established in human
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a trial using Nubixamol,
a one-to-one ratio of CBD to THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: in patients with poorly controlled pain
already treated with opioids, and here you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see from baseline, the group that was
getting 20 milligrams did much better than
[SPEAKER_00]: the group that was getting 52 or 83
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less can be more with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entourage effect can also change the
dose response curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a study from 2015 in rats looking
at pain and inflammation, and it showed
[SPEAKER_00]: that a full plant extract of CBD performed
better than the individualized CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule, and with the full plant extract
here on the right, we didn't see this
[SPEAKER_00]: biphasic dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kept getting better and better as
the dose went up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole plant entourage, I think,
can really change the dose response curve,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if we have the whole plant entourage,
again, I believe that we can get better
[SPEAKER_00]: results at a lower dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the patients that are on too high
of a dose, I developed a six-day protocol
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets them to lower their dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes two days of cannabis
abstinence, three days of very careful
[SPEAKER_00]: titration, and on the sixth day,
they go to the dose that gets them the
[SPEAKER_00]: same benefit they had previously,
and usually they've reduced their dose by
[SPEAKER_00]: about 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't work for everyone, but it works
for most people, so they're using less
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects, saving money, feeling more
functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is supporting evidence to this
concept of sensitization to cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and most of you probably have your own
supporting evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people, for the first time
when they try using THC-based cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's in high school or college or
whenever, they don't feel anything the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time, and it's the second or third
time that they feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a sensitization process
going on, or maybe they're just becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: more aware of what those psychoactive
effects are like and how to describe them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, I thank John McPartlin for
these three references here, and this
[SPEAKER_00]: first one that just came out this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 48 hours of abstinence is enough to
return cannabinoid receptor levels to
[SPEAKER_00]: their baseline after they've been
down-regulated due to THC tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also evidence that THC can
actually up-regulate the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system at certain doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another experience that I've had with THC,
especially in cannabis-naive patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this widening of the therapeutic window
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with any medicine, we have the
effective dose, and we have the dose
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to cause intolerable side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_00]: With THC, first of all, cannabis-naive
patients are much more likely to have side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, whereas regular users have much
fewer side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time, THC can widen its
therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_00]: People tend to build tolerance to the
effects of THC at different rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and usually people will build tolerance to
the adverse effects faster than they build
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance to the beneficial effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use this understanding in our
plan with patients to help them get better
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy with less side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also bidirectional effects in
cannabinoid medicine, and we see this all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, as Martin Lee described it,
is a dialectical substance or dialectical
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, the same medicine can
have opposite responses in different
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you give it to someone that's anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might make them less anxious,
but you give it to someone that's relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might make them more anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an old study with THC from 71.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see this all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give 9 out of 10 people one strain that
gives them energy, and the 10th person,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sedates them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all over the place in cannabinoid
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens within the same individual,
the same medicine, the same dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it to someone in a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it to someone in a relaxing
environment, and they'll get even more
[SPEAKER_00]: relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it to someone in a stressful
environment, and they'll get more anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the different doses of the same
medicine in the same individual can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: completely opposite effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with cannabis overdose, especially
orally, we tend to see the symptoms that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis would tend to treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a low dose, it might reduce anxiety,
reduce pain, reduce nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a high dose, it'll cause them to get
anxious, experience pain, and start
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the discoveries that I made a
couple years ago came from a mom who came
[SPEAKER_00]: back with her seizure child and said,
this CBD is really working well to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had just started the lab up,
and I said, well, let's find out what's in
[SPEAKER_00]: that CBD and how much of the CBD they're
actually getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ran the test, and we found that
there was no CBD in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also no THC in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was quite a small amount of
THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a very surprising finding to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably 99% of the research on
cannabinoids as they act on animal
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology has been done on the neutral
compounds that have been decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, oops, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This carboxylic acid group decarboxylates
when exposed to heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the smoking, all the heating,
and so forth changes the acidic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids to neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of evidence about the
therapeutic effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually summarized beautifully
in a paper on a poster that's downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the author of that poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for one, there's really no
psychoactivity, especially at these doses,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are relatively high doses tested in
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that THCA suppresses tumor
necrosis factor alpha, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammatory mediator that's part of the
process of many different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's both THCA and CBD are COX inhibitors,
so they have these anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, CBDA is kind of a COX2
selective inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know too much more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple interesting studies from 2013
came out looking at THCA to reduce nausea
[SPEAKER_00]: and vomiting behavior in rats that were
treated with lithium chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was that these tiny
doses, .05 milligrams per kilogram of body
[SPEAKER_00]: weight of THCA reduced the gagging
episodes significantly, whereas 10 times
[SPEAKER_00]: that dose of THCA didn't improve efficacy,
and the same dose of THC did nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it was 10 times this dose of THC
that did something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the researchers found, wow,
one-tenth of the dose of THC, THCA can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually suppress this nausea and
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next study they did actually
switched over to microgram dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this .05, this is 50 micrograms per
kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They repeated the study using even lower
dosages of CBDA and found that one
[SPEAKER_00]: microgram per kilogram of CBDA could
reduce seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tiny, tiny dosing of the raw
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now thank you to Ethan Russo for providing
me this photocopy of the scan of the paper
[SPEAKER_00]: from 19, where were we, 79, showing that
relatively high doses of THCA had an
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-convulsant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In mice, 200 and 400 milligrams per
kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm seeing clinically,
I'm going to present to you now regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: ultra-low doses of THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a five-year-old boy who failed
six anti-convulsants, ketogenic diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a frontal lobectomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had both autism and seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came to me from out of state.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had illegally tried CBD, THC,
and THCA all without efficacy in this
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing range, two to five milligrams per
kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per kilogram per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's similar to what you've heard
some of the other presenters describe
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, you know, I've seen some
responses to ultra-low doses of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's decrease THCA to, I was shooting for
.05 milligrams per kilogram per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of taking the .3 milligrams of
THCA three times a day, the parents made a
[SPEAKER_00]: happy little accident and gave it just one
once a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is 15 micrograms per kilogram
per day, and the seizures totally
[SPEAKER_00]: resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about a third of a
milligram once a day of THCA seizures
[SPEAKER_00]: resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They doubled the dose, and the seizures
recurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut the dose down again, and the
seizures resolved again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've found is that that previous
dose response curve that I described is
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultra-high doses, by the way,
can be very effective in different
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that there's a dose response
section, a curve way down here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: microgram dosing range that's actually
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for everyone, but for many patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of us clinicians are probably
starting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us clinicians are probably
starting here or here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're missing this whole low part of
the dose response curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also evidence that THC can have
effects that these micrograms and
[SPEAKER_00]: microgram doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was mice, THC given two hours before
myocardial infarction, improved fractional
[SPEAKER_00]: shortening, troponin leakage, infarct
size, and inflammation in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabinoids in tiny doses can do
things physiologically that are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another case.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 13-year-old girl with Dravet syndrome
failed about 20 drugs, vagal nerve
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulator, ketogenic diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had tried CBD and had some initial
improvement in cognitive recognition,
[SPEAKER_00]: but anything above this very low dose
would increase her seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found that THCA at 80 milligrams per
day was the best treatment and overall had
[SPEAKER_00]: about 90% seizure reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank Dr. Gaitanis for
connecting me with this patient who made a
[SPEAKER_00]: profound influence on my career and my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he cared for her for almost her whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, also this family were pioneers in
using THC as a rescue to abort generalized
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rubbing 10 to 20 milligrams of THC into
the gums or using it rectally would abort
[SPEAKER_00]: the seizure within less than a minute,
sometimes just seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's all the
neuroprotective aspects of THC on board
[SPEAKER_00]: for the seizure recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now interestingly, while she was using
THCA, they switched strains and found that
[SPEAKER_00]: the subsequent strain was not as effective
as the previous strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, well, get your hands on both,
we want to test this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they tested both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we, what we found was that the
strain that worked had very high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linalool is a terpene that's found in
lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known to have sedating properties and
also in a couple of studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: anticonvulsant properties and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can start to see how the entourage
makes sense when working with these
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene compounds and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This strain worked well, the other strain
worked somewhat, but this, this worked the
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a little tribute to Anthony May
who died a few weeks ago of sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected death in epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we continue to learn from all that she
taught us.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was an incredible patient and I'm just
so honored to be part of her path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last case that I'll present,
a five year old with epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: having two to 30 clusters of partial
seizures every day, plus a ton of chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: seizure each night, failed a few drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started THC at this new low
dose, you know, that was about 0.04.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one milligram of THC twice
daily had an immediate effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: four days seizure free right after
starting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so surprising that one milligram can
have this powerful effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went up to two milligrams twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the seizures resolved except for that
nighttime seizure, which was now averaging
[SPEAKER_00]: every other night instead of every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently this family's tapering
valproic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've went from 625 down to 125
milligrams daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: We increased THC a little bit to control
seizures and he's doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very happy on the lower dose that
his hair is growing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that this family is very enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of my take home messages,
there is a extraordinarily wide and safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: effective dosing range for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage clinicians and also the
people that are designing experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: trials to explore the edges of this wide
effective dosing range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's some really interesting
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these multiphasic dose response
curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see bi-directional effects in
cannabinoid medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a pain to control for those in
clinical trials, but I think we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how this medicine works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very promising results with acidic
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage people to try them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the improved efficacy with
the synergy of the phytoconstituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
