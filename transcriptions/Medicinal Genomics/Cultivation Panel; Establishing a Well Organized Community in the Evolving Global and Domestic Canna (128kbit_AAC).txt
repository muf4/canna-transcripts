[SPEAKER_10]: Community.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an indispensable component of any
successful business, cannabis included.
[SPEAKER_10]: Networking, collaboration, and strategic
partnerships are playing a more important
[SPEAKER_10]: role in the evolution of our industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: This conference has demonstrated the
dynamic reality of shifting social
[SPEAKER_10]: attitudes and greater acceptance of the
medical efficacy of cannabis by the
[SPEAKER_10]: scientific and medical communities.
[SPEAKER_10]: The need to work together, though,
is greater than ever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hypercompetitive attitudes, only serve the
needs of a select few.
[SPEAKER_10]: In actuality, we operate in an age of
unprecedented information sharing.
[SPEAKER_10]: To that end, CanMed has notably created a
space to share cannabis information in a
[SPEAKER_10]: very meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all appreciate this opportunity today
and that mission and are honored to be
[SPEAKER_10]: speaking here.
[SPEAKER_10]: In our work, community literally starts
from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nature crafts complex ecosystems that we
growers nurture.
[SPEAKER_10]: This rhizosomal ecosystem forms the base
community that supports everything else
[SPEAKER_10]: that we do as a business and industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: This panel was formed to discuss the
intricacies inherent in the simple concept
[SPEAKER_10]: of community.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gentlemen, it's great to have you here
today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all have impacted our collective
cannabis community in very different ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: So to have an opportunity to assemble you
all in one place is really, really
[SPEAKER_10]: special.
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Each of us represents a thread in the
communal fabric that is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: CanMed has helped reinforce the importance
of establishing a dynamic cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: community, and I welcome Reggie,
David, Big Mike, and Jason to discuss that
[SPEAKER_10]: very subject today.
[SPEAKER_10]: So to start off, what does community mean
to you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, when we first started,
we were in the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the community was very limited to who
we could talk to and who we could speak
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we kind of had a closed off
mindset when it came to that kind of thing
[SPEAKER_02]: because we didn't know if they were the
man or we were going to be going to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now it's a whole different world out
there and we must work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more that I collaborate, the more that
I meet people and I talk to them,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is how things get done in today's
society.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, look, you don't have to give your
secret, secret trade stuff out,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's this community now that's out
there that's open and willing to discuss
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should embrace that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to get things done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to move this industry faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I like to talk to everyone and
anyone that I can that can help out and
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can help them in sharing
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_12]: Coming from the cultivation side,
you know, in the black market days,
[SPEAKER_12]: nobody wanted to share any of their
secrets.
[SPEAKER_12]: You wanted to keep, you know, your special
sauce in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: As we're expanding and starting larger
scale cultivation centers and then what
[SPEAKER_12]: will be acres and acres of cannabis
cultivation, we're all going to deal with
[SPEAKER_12]: the same problems, you know, powdering the
loop.
[SPEAKER_12]: Petritis, facarium, things like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: These problems are not necessarily in the
secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_12]: These are problems that all of us have to
deal with and that all of us should work
[SPEAKER_12]: together on and figure out safe and
effective treatments for these problems,
[SPEAKER_12]: as well as, you know, just building a team
and a community throughout this cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: David, Bridget.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess I'm here to represent academia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so for me, academia needs to work hand
in hand with the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one thing for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other thing is that right
now, so I'm from Canada, so of course,
[SPEAKER_06]: things are a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of companies are paying,
like are developing research project with
[SPEAKER_06]: academia to do things, but they want to
keep everything secret.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of money is wasted because like
the same research is done by a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: different groups separately.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we would work more together,
like networking and like collaborative
[SPEAKER_06]: competition or competition collaboration,
I'm not sure how to call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, it would be way better for the
industry move faster because no money
[SPEAKER_06]: would be wasted on replicating the same
experiments over and over in different
[SPEAKER_06]: groups.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bridget.
[SPEAKER_06]: Community.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think for me, it's been a little
different as a scientist.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we publish.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do things, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And the publish or perish thing is a very
real thing, even in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_08]: because we have investors who are like,
well, you know, why are we paying you all
[SPEAKER_08]: this R&D money if nobody knows what we're
doing, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do understand that we've had a huge
evolution of what community means because
[SPEAKER_08]: when I came into the industry and I tried
to start to talk to some of the
[SPEAKER_08]: underground breeders, said, hey,
what about sequencing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's study your genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was not a very popular thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So but it's come a long way, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think now, you know, just recently
me and my team published a paper on the
[SPEAKER_08]: terpene, you know, the genes in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, you know, if we had not been
a community minded like organization,
[SPEAKER_08]: that would have been held behind and
patented.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it is really important for for
academia industry, for the industry to
[SPEAKER_08]: understand that we get further along in
our common goal because we do have a
[SPEAKER_08]: common goal.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that common goal is us keeping the
industry to ourselves and not having big
[SPEAKER_08]: ag or whatever come and take it from us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think as long as we keep that in mind,
community kind of falls into place.
[SPEAKER_10]: So totally.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think for me, the fear was when I
got started that my community would
[SPEAKER_10]: ultimately end up being jailed if I were
to be caught or we work too closely
[SPEAKER_10]: together or collaborated.
[SPEAKER_10]: So to say that we've come a long way is an
understatement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also feel that if we don't collaborate,
if you if you're one of those people who
[SPEAKER_02]: want to hold on to all your secrets,
you're going to get left behind.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: And your secrets are going to leave with
you, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you see the relationship between
microbial and fungal communities as they
[SPEAKER_10]: relate to overall plant health?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why does investment in a healthy and vital
rhizosomal community translate into ROI
[SPEAKER_10]: for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, microbes are so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: There would be no trees, no grass,
no prairies if it wasn't for beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you talk about fungal,
I don't know who did the study,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they did a study where they used
radioactive isotopes and they wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: check out the soil web in these trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they fed the one tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to their amazement, none of the
isotopes were in that tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were in a tree 400 yards away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was another tree 100 yards
away, another one 400 yards away.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sending and they're communicating
with each other and they're putting in the
[SPEAKER_02]: vital nutrients and what they're looking
for for survival.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're helping each other out in that
forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing lives without microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's no community.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really do think the cannabis industry is
going to be driving the study of this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that we have the funding and the
desire to see this, I think cannabis right
[SPEAKER_12]: now is in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_12]: What we're really doing right now is just
trying to out compete the bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're putting our bacillus in there,
gliocladiums, pseudomonas is in there to
[SPEAKER_12]: out compete, but we're really not sure
which one of these is the most effective
[SPEAKER_12]: right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's going to require a lot of
research and a lot of science behind it
[SPEAKER_12]: that the growers see the cause and effect
and we see the benefits of these,
[SPEAKER_12]: but we don't know exactly which is doing
the most there and which is specific to
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis and which is just specific to out
competing other detrimental biologicals.
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it's interesting because
there is a whole set of terpene genes that
[SPEAKER_08]: are only expressed in the roots,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, clearly there is communication between
the plant and the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that communication is there for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: The terpenes that get expressed in the
roots are likely and they're mostly
[SPEAKER_08]: monoterpenes, so they are able to be
volatilized and spread easily in the soil,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that means that there is some sort of
conditioning or attraction repellent,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, repellent kind of thing going on
where the plant is communicating to the
[SPEAKER_08]: soil what it needs and in response the
soil is providing it with the nutrients
[SPEAKER_08]: and also the beneficial microbes that are
helping that life cycle, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: progress, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there is communication.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a living mat, right, from the soil up
to the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one big living organism, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think to make the link with the first
question, again, it's one place where,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we need to see the results from
all the different groups that are working
[SPEAKER_06]: in that aspect.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there was Daniel Hendricks that were
showing his results.
[SPEAKER_06]: My group is doing similar thing about
playing with the microbiome of cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: curry.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of improvements that can be
done in that area for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a lot of research we still
need to do to understand the relationships
[SPEAKER_10]: between the microbes, the fungi,
and the overall plant health, but one
[SPEAKER_10]: thing that we can all agree on is they're
linked.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's definitely a strong relationship
with the healthy community there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mandatory testing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Boy, that's been a hot button issue in the
last couple of years, hasn't it?
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you guys interact with the
regulatory bodies that govern how you
[SPEAKER_10]: operate your business?
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you ever run into trouble and how do
you feel about mandatory testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I love mandatory testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My third party is that that cannot be
bought or corrupted.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to go through another kind of
cycle of testing where we have labs that
[SPEAKER_02]: are just, they're there to help the
community make sure that safe products are
[SPEAKER_02]: going out and they can't be bought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I would agree with that as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mandatory testing, we need it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We need safe products out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: What we do need is standards.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, lots of labs have different
standards.
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of labs have different techniques.
[SPEAKER_12]: We need mandated standards so that we get
consistent results through any lab that
[SPEAKER_12]: you use.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know in Colorado, there's a game to be
played, especially when it comes to
[SPEAKER_12]: potency testing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some labs will give you better results
than others.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also know that you can take the
same sample and test it in three different
[SPEAKER_12]: methods and get three different results
with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So really standardizing the way that these
third party labs test and then,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, making sure that there is some
governing bodies that make sure that these
[SPEAKER_12]: companies are not bought out or that
you're not paying extra to get,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, that couple percent in your THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: Potencies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me, in Canada, I guess it's a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like for me, I think that there could
be exception to mandatory testing for
[SPEAKER_06]: people like me doing research.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm not selling any product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so to me, like sometimes it does
not make sense that I'm required to do,
[SPEAKER_06]: like to have my product tested even though
I just wanted to, you know, weight them
[SPEAKER_06]: and have an idea of did I get an
improvement using that experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I understand that like for companies,
it's something that should stay like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for research, I think there should be
some exceptions.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I should speak on this
one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming from a lab previously, I think I
should recuse myself from this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, if we're going to treat it
like a medicine, or if we're going to call
[SPEAKER_08]: it a medicine, it should be treated like a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's all I'm going to say on that
one.
So.
[SPEAKER_10]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been operating in Arizona for the
last decade.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we got mandatory testing like last
week.
[SPEAKER_10]: And up until this point, the onus of
responsibility has been up to dispensary
[SPEAKER_10]: owners and cultivators to maintain
standards of purity.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a result, patients have suffered.
[SPEAKER_10]: Aspergillus, powdery mildew, black toxin
mold have all made it out into the patient
[SPEAKER_10]: scene.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a result, people have gotten sick.
[SPEAKER_10]: So people have died.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_08]: People have died from aspergillus and
other things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it's not the cannabis that's
killing them, but it's bad cannabis that
[SPEAKER_08]: when put into the wrong body creates a bad
situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for that reason alone, again,
if we're going to use it as medicine,
[SPEAKER_08]: it should be treated like medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have individuals that are so profit
focused that they'll sacrifice the
[SPEAKER_10]: well-being of their patients to bring a
product to market.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why third party testing is so
mandatory.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's chat about the value of networking.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you feel about collaboration versus
competition, about co-branding,
[SPEAKER_10]: global distribution change and research
between nations and working with global
[SPEAKER_10]: partners that have similar cannabis
legislation to our own or enhanced
[SPEAKER_10]: legislation like Canadians?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in today's cannabis world,
collaboration is a must.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much competition out there and
we need to get together in groups of the
[SPEAKER_02]: smartest people and collaborate who know
what they're doing and make superior
[SPEAKER_02]: products for the patients that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collaboration is extremely important in
today's day and age, especially coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: of a black market where we didn't
collaborate with people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once again, from the cultivation side,
as we get more and more into this and we
[SPEAKER_12]: progress further along, we're starting to
find that you need to really specialize in
[SPEAKER_12]: areas.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your breeder needs to be a specialist.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even your propagators and your
phenohunters need to be specialists on
[SPEAKER_12]: this.
[SPEAKER_12]: While a lot of the early emerging markets
were required to be vertically integrated,
[SPEAKER_12]: now some of those requirements are going
away.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no way around joining forces with
other teams and with other companies that
[SPEAKER_12]: may have a specialty that you don't
possess.
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, years will be wasted in
research that someone else has already
[SPEAKER_12]: done just by not sharing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm lucky enough to be from a province
where the government actually created an
[SPEAKER_06]: office that is responsible to build that
cannabis industry in the province.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to link the industry with
the academia and third party testing
[SPEAKER_06]: agency and the health authorities.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're traveling the world trying to lure
companies to New Brunswick.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very nice to see that, but we're
almost the only province that has that and
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope at some point the other will follow
our steps and that you will have the same
[SPEAKER_06]: here in the US once it's legalized.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other point I'm going to raise here is
that I would also like to see more
[SPEAKER_06]: collaboration between Canada and the US
because since it's legal on our side of
[SPEAKER_06]: the country, off the border, there's a lot
of things we can do that you cannot do
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: By playing together, then maybe you can
accomplish more and get ready quicker for
[SPEAKER_06]: when it's going to be legal here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the ultimate collaboration will be
when we can actually start to ship stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: across borders and it's one big global
economy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what ultimately we have to
go for.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only way you do that is to get back to
standards and a oneness.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to have some governing body that
steps in and says, this is the way we have
[SPEAKER_08]: to do it so that the labs are performing
the same way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that everybody has the same target and
then we don't have 87 different freaking
[SPEAKER_08]: regulations because they test for 22
pesticides, but they test for 104
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Human safety is not a commodity and all
humans suffer from the same things more or
[SPEAKER_08]: less.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand why there are different
regulations in the first place.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to me when you have different
regulations, you're saying that some
[SPEAKER_08]: people are more or less susceptible to
certain things than other people,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is a crock of shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I say that?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not on TV, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's what we really need to
strive for in the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it has to come from in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we wait for the USDA or the European
Union or whoever to do it, then they're
[SPEAKER_08]: going to come down with regulations that
we don't like.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if we drive it from the inside,
and come up with stuff that is sane and
[SPEAKER_08]: reasonable and promotes good products for
the patients, I think we'll have a
[SPEAKER_08]: standard that they would adopt,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's ultimately what we
should be on for, so.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd love to see sanity and reason from our
government, period.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that might be wishful thinking.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ours is a global community with
unprecedented access to technology.
[SPEAKER_10]: Online communities and forums have become
more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_10]: What relationship do you feel our industry
will have with tech and online
[SPEAKER_12]: communities?
[SPEAKER_12]: I find them to be a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_12]: You hit the message boards when you find a
problem that you haven't encountered
[SPEAKER_12]: before or something that you're looking
at.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll hit the message boards,
see some of the smaller scale growers,
[SPEAKER_12]: what they've run into, things that they've
tried, stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think as we mature as an industry,
we need to start moving towards peer
[SPEAKER_12]: review papers, real research with solid
control.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the boards are great, especially
for first time growers and people coming
[SPEAKER_02]: into our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get the information that they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then obviously as you graduate,
there should be parts of the board that go
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way up into the scientific
community where we can talk to each other
[SPEAKER_02]: in the language, where we understand it
doesn't sound like a foreign language when
[SPEAKER_02]: we're speaking to someone that's needed as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a lot of project ideas by looking
at those forums, so it's always a nice
[SPEAKER_06]: place to look.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as you said, I think we should move
toward more peer review.
[SPEAKER_06]: More reviewed articles and more curated
source, especially I have a plant
[SPEAKER_06]: pathology background, so I'm interested in
cannabis diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is one of the worst example.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will see a lot of pictures and then
people, oh, this is that thing and this is
[SPEAKER_06]: that thing, and often it's not that at
all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see many people saying this is rust.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure nobody has ever seen rust on
cannabis, so there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: misinformation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's why we need to move
toward more curated platforms and stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I agree 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I will say that when I first
started growing and I had brown spots and
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know what they were, I went to
the board.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gene editing and genetic intellectual
property have become hot topics in popular
[SPEAKER_10]: culture, in our scientific community,
and indeed here at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_10]: What does genetic modification in cannabis
actually mean and how do you feel about
[SPEAKER_10]: this technology?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, let me start here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Genetic modification, so let's start with
the definition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because a lot of things that we talk about
in the cannabis industry are not GMO.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you have a knockout that's used
CRISPR or something like that,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's GMO.
[SPEAKER_08]: But technically it's not even GMO because
traditionally GMO was you introduced DNA
[SPEAKER_08]: from a another organism into that
recipient organism.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was technically why the European
Union went nuts and genetic modification
[SPEAKER_08]: was banned and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you use CRISPR to knock a gene
out, is that really genetic modification
[SPEAKER_08]: or is that just accelerated breeding?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we use marker-assisted breeding to
do the same thing and that's not genetic
[SPEAKER_08]: modification because we use traditional
breeding techniques, we just accelerate
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So having said that, have at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Reggie.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of stuff that is not
considered genetic modification and that
[SPEAKER_06]: people can grow organic and one example is
that crops have been like irradiated to
[SPEAKER_06]: produce mutation, like the red grapefruit
is an example.
[SPEAKER_06]: So CRISPR to me is just the same thing but
instead of, you know, having thousands of
[SPEAKER_06]: unknown mutation, you have one mutation
exactly where you want it to go on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to consider gene editing as
a GMO, then all those like gamma
[SPEAKER_06]: irradiated crop need to be considered GMO
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: When people aren't aware, a lot of the
vegetables and fruits that you're eating
[SPEAKER_02]: today have been gene edited and you can
use both a conventional path or gene
[SPEAKER_02]: editing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the two go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the future in cannabis, you're going
to see a lot of gene editing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be we're looking at it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not considered GMO and you can get to
the results in some cases a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I personally like it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with all the panelists here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's no way around at least
gene editing in our field.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have bred nothing for resistance to
pathogens, diseases, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've bred strictly for smell,
flavor, taste, potency, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've really bred for nothing but potency,
smell, taste, looks like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing that affects resistance to
anything and we're really behind.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to need to really step up as
an industry to make sure that it's done
[SPEAKER_12]: safely and that it's done carefully and
with some purpose as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's just no way around using it to
kind of get back in line with a big ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was going to say about gene
editing, oh boy, I lost my place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just pass right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have also something more to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in California here you have someone,
you have a couple actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Pamela Ronald and her husband,
Raul Adamchuk.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one is like a big advocate of gene
editing technique.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other one is an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to me that's the perfect example of
what the future should be like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Organic growers should embrace gene
editing technology because it's just the
[SPEAKER_06]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gene editing will also allow for more
competitively priced products in the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got to biosynthesize a cannabinoid,
it's going to be a hell of a lot cheaper
[SPEAKER_02]: to gene edit a plant and grow it in the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so gene editing is going to offer
certain hard to get cannabinoids at more
[SPEAKER_02]: affordable prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means our products will be more
affordable for the patient to buy as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ironically, as the molecular biologist
here, I'm not a big fan of gene editing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So go figure.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, traditional breeding
accelerated with molecular diagnostics is
[SPEAKER_08]: another form of gene editing that just
doesn't use the CRISPR technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's intelligent breeding done with data
so you're driving to a product.
[SPEAKER_08]: That also can be done in an accelerated
fashion.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be honest, gene editing to model is
a great thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I'm trying to build a strain,
gene editing helps me determine whether or
[SPEAKER_08]: not that feasibility study works.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then you go back or I go back and then
breed it traditionally using molecular
[SPEAKER_08]: markers.
So.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think the farm bill and legalized
hemp is going to change how we approach
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis IP?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you look, they make you put,
it says hemp derived phyto cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means we can grow any kind of
cannabinoid and get that plant to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: any kind of cannabinoid except THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That plant is wide open for research.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot we can do with hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think we're going to see more
research into isolating?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see a lot of research in
regards to hemp in the future.
[SPEAKER_10]: Including isolating different cannabinoids
that we have already?
[SPEAKER_02]: Isolating different cannabinoids for
textile use, for production of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see all kinds of different
things coming out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd actually say that you're going to see
hemp that's being bred for multiple
[SPEAKER_08]: passes, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now we talk about hemp for CBD or
we talk about hemp for fire, excuse me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Passes at multiple bites at the apple,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So we talk about CBD hemp or fiber hemp or
hemp for seed, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But theoretically, if you are gene editing
or you are breeding intelligently,
[SPEAKER_08]: you actually can build a hemp that you
extract the CBD first and then you send it
[SPEAKER_08]: on for fiber processing, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no reason why that can't be done.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just we haven't had a reason to build
it yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're 100% correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what has been done for flax,
for example, where you use to have like
[SPEAKER_06]: flax for linen and for flax for seed and
then they build that like for full usage
[SPEAKER_06]: or double purpose flax.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it will be the same for hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hemp will be used completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then it's reduced waste as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you feel your work is impacting
local and global communities?
[SPEAKER_12]: I can really only speak to the local
community just with the laws and
[SPEAKER_12]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think it's improved the community
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: In Colorado, we've seen quite a bit of
money pushed into our schools,
[SPEAKER_12]: quite a bit of money pushed into our
roads, quite a bit of money just pushed
[SPEAKER_12]: into our economy in general, as well as
just taking away what is a lot of us have
[SPEAKER_12]: lived with is the fear of what is a great
product, what is a safe product,
[SPEAKER_12]: what is something that is wonderful to
use.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think the work we're doing here is
really starting to improve and change the
[SPEAKER_12]: minds of most of the world on what
cannabis can do for everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very locally.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like my lab is located for like an
eight minutes drive from a licensed
[SPEAKER_06]: producer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So every time they have a problem,
they will just call me and then it's very
[SPEAKER_06]: easy for me to try to help them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the very local way to help the
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: But from a more global perspective,
I'm trying like with my group,
[SPEAKER_06]: to put some resources that will help the
industry from like internationally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like one example is that I'm trying to
build that pest and disease survey.
[SPEAKER_06]: For now, of course, it's a little bit more
restricted to Canada because of shipping
[SPEAKER_06]: problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is something that at some point
some people in the US will add their
[SPEAKER_06]: information and by building that global
database, it will just help anybody in the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry no matter where they are in the
world.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you see a need for a global pest and
disease database?
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure, because I mean like if you think
of Dutch Helm disease, chestnut blight,
[SPEAKER_06]: those were all disease that were not
present in the US and were introduced from
[SPEAKER_06]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have a chance to know those disease
before they arrive here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to know what is present here,
what is present elsewhere and put in place
[SPEAKER_06]: like all the detection assays that
medicinal genomics will develop for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, you'll be able to know
when something is new and make sure that
[SPEAKER_06]: is destroyed immediately.
[SPEAKER_10]: As a cultivator, it's more vital than ever
that we develop that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lately, I've been enjoying going to
different countries around the world and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a few more that want to see me and
talk to me about getting their programs
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a lot in this state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should share that with the world
because you'd be surprised how many
[SPEAKER_02]: countries and ministers in those countries
have no idea at all about what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be part of it, but they just
don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our community should be going out to
the world and teaching and instructing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the science that we've done has all
been published, so that's available to
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they take advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because A, we worked hard on it for you
guys, but we shared it because there is a
[SPEAKER_08]: need for the community to kind of pick
itself up out of the dark ages by science
[SPEAKER_08]: and get ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of my big things when I came into
the industry was, hey, if you don't do it,
[SPEAKER_08]: they'll come and do it for you,
which is the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: But on the more local side, it's been a
real pleasure to be able to educate,
[SPEAKER_08]: and again, it's about education,
people about genetics and the power of
[SPEAKER_08]: marker-assisted breeding and how that
stuff actually can bring the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: industry a whole generation faster.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the most important thing that
we do is the education part, both on the
[SPEAKER_08]: local and the global side.
[SPEAKER_08]: And any of you who have not had that
opportunity, people are so thankful around
[SPEAKER_08]: the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in Zimbabwe recently talking to the
Minister of Agriculture there,
[SPEAKER_08]: and they love when people come and teach
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if any of you have a desire to teach,
this is the industry to do it in because
[SPEAKER_08]: people are hungry for what we know.
So.
[SPEAKER_10]: What advice would you give a young person
who's interested in cannabis today with
[SPEAKER_10]: that in mind?
Education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, if you're a young person,
you want to get into this industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: go to a lot of shows, talk to a lot of
people, go into labs, get tours,
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to people who are into trenches,
understand this industry as much as you
[SPEAKER_02]: can, but more importantly than that,
pick the area in which you want to go into
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's so many different aspects
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, find where you want to go,
what you want to do, and then study the
[SPEAKER_02]: hell out of it, both academically and in
the trenches.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much more I have to add to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, I mean, it's like don't work
alone.
[SPEAKER_12]: And perhaps be open, especially on the
cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_12]: We like to call it the e-grow,
but know that there are a million
[SPEAKER_12]: different ways to grow cannabis and none
of them could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, to be open to new
experiences and new ways of doing things.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've talked a little bit about the
culture and social and economic impact
[SPEAKER_10]: that we've had in our communities.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to talk a little bit about social
equity programs that have become more and
[SPEAKER_10]: more commonplace with new states.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're being enacted in several different
states to help level the playing field for
[SPEAKER_10]: those individuals who have been
disproportionately affected or
[SPEAKER_10]: disadvantaged by cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are your thoughts on programs like
this that give licensing preference or
[SPEAKER_10]: discounts to people with prior cannabis
convictions?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think by and large the programs being
put forth are all shams, honestly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think any of them are actually
doing people of color much good anywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: How about people with prior cannabis
convictions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I've been approached several
different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had people come to me, hey,
I'm going to get this opportunity in this
[SPEAKER_02]: social equity program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to buy your license from me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other one is, will you
partner with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't sell your license.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that license, find a person,
get a great lawyer, and make a deal that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can live with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, as my answer was before, start
studying your ass off and figuring out
[SPEAKER_02]: what this industry is and learn by the
path of hard knocks and become a business
[SPEAKER_02]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll do extremely well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a hell of an opportunity for you to
get one of those licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not squander it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that opportunity and run with it and
go as far as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to know more about it,
you can listen to Business Outlaws.
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach business there all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about cannabis stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Mike.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: With that in mind, I'm going to ask my
final question, which I've asked during
[SPEAKER_10]: every AMA I ever hosted.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do you envision the cannabis
industry in five years from today?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess we discuss about having a
unified set of testing approaches.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about networks, communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope that we will have some global
partnership that will emerge from all
[SPEAKER_06]: those conferences that we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, public databases.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I would really like to see would
be an international germplasm repository.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess I'm dreaming about this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Reggie, you got something to say about
repository for germplasm?
[SPEAKER_08]: So an international germplasm repository
would be outstanding.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have them for every other important
economic crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hemp, arguably, is one of the most
important economic crops.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's never been put in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: To any appreciable degree, I believe there
are some hemp strains in the Volcani
[SPEAKER_08]: Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm not sure that would be a good
representative sample of all the hemp in
[SPEAKER_08]: the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's something that we need.
[SPEAKER_08]: Genetic diversity is a thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being lost.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that from science because we've
seen papers where they've seen the drive
[SPEAKER_08]: for high THC has completely eliminated
some minor cannabinoids and high THC
[SPEAKER_08]: strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are already doing damage to the
plant and losing some of those minor
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the reality is in three to five years
from now, at least from the regulatory
[SPEAKER_08]: side, we're not going to be in any
different spot than we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have the same conversation
three to five years from now about the
[SPEAKER_08]: USDA coming in and regulating things for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, five years from now, I see we have
banks that accept cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the US a lot more opened up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot more hemp being used.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been growing around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see a lot of countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, South Korea now has in their creams
and their stuff that they put on are
[SPEAKER_02]: allowing for CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oklahoma opened up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that'd be the last state,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That or Utah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that the world is going to open up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a totally different
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the United States will be able
to import and export there won't be a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem with 280E.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be able to bank.
[SPEAKER_12]: I see us growing a lot more especially
cannabinoids as we discover what these do
[SPEAKER_12]: and what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_12]: I also see the industry possibly following
what the beer industry has done where it
[SPEAKER_12]: goes through ebb and flows of
microbreweries and then just major huge
[SPEAKER_12]: breweries with the cost of regulation with
the inability to take the tax breaks and
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff that are available right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really see only the big guys surviving
for the next five years and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_12]: mom and pops dropping out.
[SPEAKER_12]: But as we move forward even past five
years and we start kind of correcting some
[SPEAKER_12]: of the regulation issues that we have,
I'll see some of the more micro grows come
[SPEAKER_12]: back into the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: After alcohol prohibition it took 30 years
for everything to get straightened out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the internet and better
communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to guess I'm going to say 15
to 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing should be pretty well running
the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever way that's going to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully sooner.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well guys and everybody here before I open
up a QA session I'm sure everybody has
[SPEAKER_10]: some questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to take a moment to recognize all
of you here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every one of you here is a trailblazer who
has impacted our community in some way
[SPEAKER_10]: shape or form and we all owe you a debt of
gratitude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for being here and for
the impact that you've had on all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we're hiring scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested send into science at
advanced hemp dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Science at advanced hemp dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for the brightest smartest
people out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got to get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as we depart today I have a message for
all of you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I urge every individual who's assembled
here today to take a moment to reflect on
[SPEAKER_10]: your own community and the impact that
you're going to have on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: How does your work your research and your
dedication change your community.
[SPEAKER_10]: What will be your legacy.
[SPEAKER_10]: With that in mind let's all work together.
[SPEAKER_10]: Questions to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked about for need for deeper
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would love to hear an example
you can share where you had collaborated
[SPEAKER_01]: with the stakeholders and where you would
want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you want that to be improved
going forward.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry I missed the beginning of that
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is having spoken about the
need of more collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to hear an example of what would
that mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you had collaborated already but
you know you would like to have a better
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would that mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give an example.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my example would be where he just sat
down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kevin's back there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Kevin and my team thanks to the
outstanding sequencing work that Kevin did
[SPEAKER_08]: on Jamaican Lion my team was able to find
57 terpene genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just published that paper last week in
PLOS ONE again.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know Steep Hill had its own genetic
program medicinal germ was headed on
[SPEAKER_08]: genetic program.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yet we were able to come together and
do some great work together.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody read that paper by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't be afraid to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go up to somebody introduce yourself and
shake their hand and go hey I like to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: to you about X or Y or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't just just go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be amazed how many people especially
here I talk to you are just willing to
[SPEAKER_02]: open up and talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really wonderful presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious what what exciting trends do
you guys see and how are those trends sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of guiding your whether it's your work in
terms of strain development.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just what trends do you see in the market
that you think are going to become you
[SPEAKER_04]: know whether it's the next CBD to use you
know that as an example of something
[SPEAKER_04]: that's come in recent years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Took my example.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's exactly it at least for the
trend for me that I'm most excited about.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's finding what the different
cannabinoids do what the different
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenes do and what the entourage effect
does between these.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know you can take the synthetic
synthetic THC and it doesn't do anything
[SPEAKER_12]: the same as the THC grown from the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really do think that's from the
entourage effect the different
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoids and different terpenes even
the different thials that are in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just a bunch more research into these
isolating these products and really seeing
[SPEAKER_12]: what makes them tick and what makes them
tick together.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's there's a lot of research
that needs to be done on the interaction
[SPEAKER_10]: between the terpenes and the cannabinoids
and you guys are doing some of that
[SPEAKER_10]: research presently.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: In regards to all the information that we
have to collaborate on passing throughout
[SPEAKER_09]: the world technology is a great way to
build platforms to get that information
[SPEAKER_09]: expedited from point A to point B and keep
track of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of platforms and technology do
you guys suggest be built in order for
[SPEAKER_09]: this industry to accelerate at the speed
we want it to.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a programming system standpoint we
need platforms that are very strong that
[SPEAKER_02]: patients can go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tilray has a very strong platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need grower platforms for people who
can want to grow at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean there's a lot of these countries
allowing six plants per household.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need these very strong platforms
without a bunch of what I call it hippie
[SPEAKER_02]: magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's it's just real science real
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how stuff's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't behind this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this is what if you do this you'll
get this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do it you know follow the
instructions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And do you guys think that there's
opportunity for AI and machine learning
[SPEAKER_09]: and additional technologies used in in the
tech industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: To make some of these decisions predict
analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think AI will be the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got people popping up explaining
the things that you need to do and looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at that with spectral analysis they could
actually could be in your garden and a
[SPEAKER_02]: person could pop up and go hey you've got
spider mites or hey you've got powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew and here's what you need to do at
this this this early stage because we've
[SPEAKER_02]: caught it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two could come together and you'll see
stuff like that in the future for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: So facial recognition technology to
identify problems in your plant pest
[SPEAKER_10]: control deficiencies are being integrated
into platforms for the diagnostic for the
[SPEAKER_10]: purpose of diagnosis of different issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are already like a different number
of companies that are developing that for
[SPEAKER_06]: many crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean cannabis is just a different
crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like assess like a biotic and a biotic
stress like the water status of your plant
[SPEAKER_06]: and even like for cannabis you could
probably find a way to assess when the
[SPEAKER_06]: trichomes are ready you at the perfect
stage for harvesting better than the human
[SPEAKER_06]: high human I can do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could could the panel speak to the over
these next five years the role of genetics
[SPEAKER_11]: and intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the determination of the value centers
in this industry the winners and the
[SPEAKER_11]: losers how important a role will
intellectual property patenting all of
[SPEAKER_11]: that play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patents are always valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The money guys like to see patents.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see a lot of strains going
forward being patented and different
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques and things because people want
to protect their investments.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how business is done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Intellectual property is is a part of the
fabric of business.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you really cannot run a successful
business these days without intellectual
[SPEAKER_08]: property.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cannabis industry is full of potential
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So from plant strains to I'm a patent
agent.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the number of applications that I see
coming out in the cannabis industry is is
[SPEAKER_08]: enormous from things like hot gas
extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a thought.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So but there is so much innovation in this
industry right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be I would be surprised if we did
not see the cannabis industry take a large
[SPEAKER_08]: segment of issued patents in the next 10
years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the word cooperation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cooperation and competition combined.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my question is both a comment a
question initial directed to you Reggie
[SPEAKER_07]: and this is creating community through
economic cooperation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a breeder got really big into hemp
breeding where in Southern Oregon I'm with
[SPEAKER_07]: a company that's really dedicated to
breeding hemp and I create what I
[SPEAKER_07]: laughingly call three ways four ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a breeder has good feminized pollen
have a homie over here that's got a
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse full of ladies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's put that together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's share that strain three ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my question that's what I call the
three way specifically is if you could
[SPEAKER_07]: speak to that kind of whatever you want to
categorize it as the intellectual property
[SPEAKER_07]: the cross licensing how to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love to do that because I've just taken
four breeders and we've created
[SPEAKER_07]: cooperation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Economically so we have to play together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise what we see in certainly in
Oregon is the potential for all those
[SPEAKER_07]: breeders to get swallowed up by a big
company.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we're working together to start
with that to me is a way to create
[SPEAKER_07]: cooperation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I welcome any other thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: No that's actually a brilliant way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And probably a real smart way to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you've got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So so but here's where the science comes
in to support that right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you your scenario you had a guy with a
greenhouse full of ladies and somebody
[SPEAKER_08]: with really good male pollen right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So from that cross you will obviously find
several phenos unless it was a true a true
[SPEAKER_08]: breeding male and a population of breeding
females in which case you're going to get
[SPEAKER_08]: one offspring right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But either way you're going to come out
with some phenotypes from that cross that
[SPEAKER_08]: are desirable science.
[SPEAKER_08]: The science part of this is you
fingerprint them.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get you identify the unique genetic
signature and then you can then use that
[SPEAKER_08]: unique genetic signature as the basis of a
licensing program.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then because it's like a unique
genetic signature we're talking about FBI
[SPEAKER_08]: level unique right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because every cross will produce a bunch
of offspring that have their own genetics
[SPEAKER_08]: right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now anybody not in the four of you
growing that obviously got it through some
[SPEAKER_08]: ill-gotten gains.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a you know either somebody let
it go or somebody stole it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now you have the ability to protect
this right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you file a patent patent on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not very expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the plant as shown and described.
[SPEAKER_08]: You fingerprint it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got the genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you have the basis for a very
credible legal foundation to build this
[SPEAKER_08]: business on.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a brilliant idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: More people should be doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi I'm Dr. Zeon Walker and I really want
to appreciate you guys for coming out and
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing everything and I think it's pretty
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided one day that I couldn't go
back into my office and continue to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was doing because I needed to be
more in the community educating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this came after a patient came into my
office and told me hey you know I feel so
[SPEAKER_00]: much better and I got this vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I carry this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been having this thing for over a
year and I will show it to anybody who
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at it from across the room and
the person said oh it's really cool and I
[SPEAKER_00]: said oh my god they've really gotten
advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gotten a camouflage cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing has so many toxins in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until it looks like camouflage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brown and spotted all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we sit here and we talk about all
the education that we need and the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need to share among ourselves as
community professionals we still have a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional a moral obligation to talk to
everybody we see about everything that we
[SPEAKER_00]: know because they don't know and somebody
is going to kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves or you know die and it will be
attributed to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis will have nothing to do with it
and all the work that's being done here
[SPEAKER_00]: will go back under the rug again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get criminalized again and well
still yeah forgot we haven't gotten past
[SPEAKER_00]: that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to remind us that we
still have an obligation to the community
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that we educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've decided to you know chuck all of
that sitting around listening to people's
[SPEAKER_00]: problems all day but then get out in the
community and educate people so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: will know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of my lane.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Walker I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm the last one here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a question because I'm finding
the community aspect of this whole event
[SPEAKER_05]: very intriguing especially this talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for contributing to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how do I say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on the East Coast and I think the
innovation and collaboration is is
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful and it's going to just advance
and accelerate as as you are all saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way it translates to me not being
as immersed in the industry as you all are
[SPEAKER_05]: is is the products that we get say out on
the East Coast are by far I'm sorry if I
[SPEAKER_05]: offend anyone but a far inferior to then
what you get out here on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so well my question is is the
collaboration effort in any community
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's with cannabis or other things
there's always the ringleader you know in
[SPEAKER_05]: certain areas of expertise and then that
translates into innovation and community
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the byproduct is these this you
know the great product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you think is the essential
thing for you know in a place that has the
[SPEAKER_05]: products excuse me California's products
that you can get.
[SPEAKER_05]: That you know help people that are really
in need like the patients on the East
[SPEAKER_05]: Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not as much because they haven't
caught up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm worried about is as a patient
wanting to get certain products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want that collaboration to really
accelerate as much as possible in specific
[SPEAKER_05]: areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in California there there's a plethora
of you that just are out here and there's
[SPEAKER_05]: think tanks and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not saying there aren't places all
over the place that have them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe not as concentrated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you feel is the best way for to
encourage the collaboration of say what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going on in California with places that
are further behind and therefore the
[SPEAKER_05]: patients end up suffering.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually not a collaboration thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has more to do with regulations and and
attitudes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we had no borders for cannabis to
cross state lines.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd have the same products on the East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: The issue is is that states like New York
think that it's only CBD and it's only
[SPEAKER_08]: oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And and then you have to look at the way
the licensors are given out because now
[SPEAKER_08]: you have the good old boy network where
you have the 10 richest cronies who are
[SPEAKER_08]: friends with the governor get the licenses
and they may not know what the hell
[SPEAKER_08]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it has more to do with that than it has
to do with collaboration because the
[SPEAKER_08]: products are there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing keeping you from getting
them is distribution.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: True.
[SPEAKER_10]: The dichotomy is real.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in like say Boston or in Massachusetts
they're recreationally legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it's like we're trying to catch up
and they don't have a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just a lot of stuff they don't
have.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're still isolated in quarantine in
Massachusetts from California from all of
[SPEAKER_10]: us here on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think until we do away with the
interstate commerce clause that prevents
[SPEAKER_10]: us from shipping candidates domestically
you're going to still run to that problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the real issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the other part of that is actually
so as you get regulations opening up and
[SPEAKER_08]: in Massachusetts where they just did
legalize it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you're going to see a lot of the
California companies set up shop in
[SPEAKER_08]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will take them a little while to get up
and running but they will use the same
[SPEAKER_08]: SOPs they're using in their California
shops.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hurry up and get here because get to
the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
Thank you.
