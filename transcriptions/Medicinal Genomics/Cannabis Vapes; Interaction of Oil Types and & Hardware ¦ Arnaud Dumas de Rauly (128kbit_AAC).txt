[SPEAKER_01]: Different oils have different viscosities.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good rule of thumb is that distillate is
pretty viscous in terms of CPS,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're looking at anywhere between 50
and 100,000 CPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, what's CPS?
[SPEAKER_01]: Centipoise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the measure of a viscosity of a
fluid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we are looking at live resin,
we're usually on some lower viscosities
[SPEAKER_01]: because we've got some either recombined
terpenes in there or the terpenes have
[SPEAKER_01]: been re-added back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're on a product that's a little bit
more liquidy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we look at live rosin,
which is solventless, which is pressed,
[SPEAKER_01]: we go back to something very, very thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mathematical process of
vaporization is a mix of chemistry,
[SPEAKER_01]: thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to understand all three of
those to understand which hardware can
[SPEAKER_01]: work better with which oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The added complexity of cannabis is that
it is a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a natural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from one batch to the other of the
exact same strain, when you process it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will have different inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the trick is really to figure out which
hardware suits which oil the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a great rule of thumb that our
run-of-the-mill basic cartridge,
[SPEAKER_01]: the V12, is something that would work very
well with distillate and live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: For rosin, because you have more of that
full flavor, because you have more of that
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes, we need to use a different
device to make sure the client or the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient does not heat it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we increase the resistance,
for instance, to be usable on the
[SPEAKER_01]: run-of-the-mill batteries that you'd be
buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's just an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also look at the intake hole size,
because that will measure the rate at
[SPEAKER_01]: which the oil is going to feed the coil to
turn into vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, the thicker the oil,
the bigger holes you need to allow more of
[SPEAKER_01]: that to seep in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to hit it really high level,
but there's a lot more that goes into
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, the performance of the vape
cartridges on the market can literally be
[SPEAKER_01]: divided by 10 or multiplied by 10 by
changing one of those variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given that fact, and that you were
saying some processors, they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: buying kind of cheap hardware from
Alibaba, I imagine that the performance
[SPEAKER_00]: and quality of vape carts in the
marketplace can vary widely.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: Immensely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done some testing with different
viscosities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you take a very, very thick
liquid, like honey, like molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use a battery, for instance,
at a 3.7 volt setting with smaller intake
[SPEAKER_01]: holes, you're essentially not going to
allow enough oil to penetrate the coil
[SPEAKER_01]: fast enough when the coil is heating up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, the little that has made it
into the coil is going to be burning
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only are you getting bad flavor,
but you're also getting toxic emissions
[SPEAKER_01]: because burning, in essence, is the same
thing as combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're degrading the terpenes and the
cannabinoids in there and potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: ruining the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, on the other hand, if you have too
much oil that goes in and too much of an
[SPEAKER_01]: intake hole and too much of a big porosity
on the ceramic itself of the coil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are going to see saturation,
which means, which leads to clogging,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means leads to leaking and potential
spit back through the mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is very, very important to really
match the hardware to the oil or vice
[SPEAKER_01]: versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make sure you have a consistent
supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really the other,
the other side to this is the consistency
[SPEAKER_01]: of the quality of the.
I think that's really the other side to
this is the consistency of the quality of the
