[SPEAKER_02]: This is a drug that was in common use
hundreds of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the most prescribed drugs in
1900.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the pharmacopeia for physicians,
so it's already been approved and studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that we now have to re-approve it
through the FDA, which if you put aspirin
[SPEAKER_02]: through the FDA today, it wouldn't get
through, is circular thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Kevin McKernan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the CSO of Corrigent Life Sciences and
Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are two companies that are joined at
the hip.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look at personalized medicine in
patients, so we sequence patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: their genomes, to sort out what types of
defects they may have or mutations in
[SPEAKER_02]: their genome that can be properly treated.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, we're also focusing on
medical cannabis safety, and so we look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the genetics of the plants to try and help
bring some more trust and security in that
[SPEAKER_02]: field.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm honored and extremely grateful to have
as our keynote speaker and our scientific
[SPEAKER_04]: anchor and visionary for this conference,
Dr. Rafael Machulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised, very surprised to find
out that while we knew quite a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: morphine, which had been isolated from
opium many, many decades previously,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the same is true for cocaine,
the chemistry of cannabis was not well
[SPEAKER_00]: known.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was absolutely no interest
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, it seems that actually interest
is going on more on cannabidiol because of
[SPEAKER_00]: its therapeutic activities and not being
toxic and not being psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be administered to patients at huge
amounts without any side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Endocannabinoid system is an extremely
important one, and as a matter of fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: people from NIH mentioned that it's
involved in essentially all human
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very strong statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our group showed two AG works against
brain damage, so we have seen three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four of these compounds working against
brain damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others have found that CBD does that in
mice, but we have seen no work in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: When science gets politicized,
rational discourse disappears,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I feel like that really has happened
in this field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not addressing this in a rational,
thoughtful way, but we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hundreds of thousands of patients are
already using cannabis to treat symptoms,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's really important to study it in a
controlled setting because we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what the potential risks are of
cannabis use in specific patient
[SPEAKER_01]: populations, and we need to understand how
the drug interacts with other drugs the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient might be on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tilray is one of the only companies in the
world capable of producing GMP-grade
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and cannabis-derived medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is possible because Tilray is located
in Canada where federal regulations allow
[SPEAKER_01]: the production of cannabis and also
cannabis extracts that can be used in
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical research around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we want to do is produce
scientifically sound, methodologically
[SPEAKER_01]: sound research that will hopefully change
policy and also provide mainstream
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians with the tools they need in
order to treat patients with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis-derived extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: My daily living was my hands shaking so
severe I couldn't stop it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had suicidal thoughts constantly,
rage to no end.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only reason I'm here today and being
able to do this is because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: A year ago today I stopped taking all
those pills and strictly using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not had a moment of thought to
suicide or the depression that I was
[SPEAKER_05]: constantly under.
[SPEAKER_00]: If an individual decides to do what you're
doing and is being helped that's fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the physician or the physicians will
not do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm personally trying to vie for clinical
trials in football players and that we
[SPEAKER_05]: have this brain disease that leads to
Alzheimer's and dementia and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: horrific things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to find out whether the
cannabinoid system affects, positively we
[SPEAKER_00]: hope, the damage done by concussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that we could reduce by 50% the
damage that was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have strong data showing that a
cannabis-type compound helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment these compounds have never,
never been given to a human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only for concussion, for anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: This rage thing that comes along with this
brain disease is very scary and when I
[SPEAKER_05]: found certain strains of cannabis I didn't
have those feelings anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And being in Tennessee where I was at it
was difficult to get strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hey, what do you got this week?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been trying to put an end to that by
sequencing all the strains and making a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge catalog of every strain so you can
actually genetically fingerprint it and
[SPEAKER_02]: know, all right, did it change on me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just curious of your experience on
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I got to California I knew,
okay, let me go get my card, let me go
[SPEAKER_05]: down and start trying these strains
because I knew there was something with
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still really early days tying
genotypes of plants to patients but we're
[SPEAKER_02]: slowly building this database of variants
that we know predict some level of
[SPEAKER_02]: response of CBD and eventually it's going
to go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think you've been on using THC or
CBD long enough to get a sense of
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term effects for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, and I don't take a leave aspirin
or Vicodin or anything anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: People say, marijuana is a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, you know what a gateway drug is?
[SPEAKER_05]: Football.
[SPEAKER_05]: Football.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's made of six or eight drugs,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most exciting research we've seen in
addiction medicine is in CBD reducing
[SPEAKER_02]: those dopaminergic addictive desires and
it's one of the most promising drugs for
[SPEAKER_02]: ending addiction that we've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp is probably the first agricultural
plant that we ever domesticated from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right around 1937 we ripped that from our
diet and added antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have caffeine given to kids and orange
soda in school and you're not as parents,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're never even told about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of these kids are on Ritalin,
methylphenidate.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that do to their brain?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a host of things that we've
somehow said, we're not going to worry
[SPEAKER_02]: about what that does in the developing
mind but we're going to apply that
[SPEAKER_02]: scrutiny to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no logic to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see children with epilepsy
getting in and they're coming alive,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's this third rail about pediatrics
all about?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a son with severe epilepsy who's
untreated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a really severe disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was really suffering and I met a dad at
an epilepsy conference who told me that
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana was helping his son who had
severe epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked up whether marijuana had any
compounds that might be anti-convulsive
[SPEAKER_01]: and I found some literature from the 70s
and 80s showing that in fact CBD is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently anti-convulsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: 35 years ago we admitted administered
cannabidiol to epileptic patients and we
[SPEAKER_00]: found that those eight patients that got
the material, four of them didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: epileptic attacks during the period that
we gave them cannabidiol, three had much
[SPEAKER_00]: less and one was not affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we want to do is make sure that
everyone has access right now in whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: way they can but at the same time do the
rigorous research that's required.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I want to figure out is how we
can move the needle very quickly on policy
[SPEAKER_01]: while also collecting clinical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need clinical trials and unfortunately
until recently there were very few
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Policy I think has really interfered with
the progress of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legal part has to do something with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stigma has something to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids that we have here that have severe
epilepsy, they look on a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: other pharmaceutical drugs, they look as
if they're complete zombies and you put
[SPEAKER_02]: them on CBD and suddenly they're now awake
and conscious and they're having
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations with their parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they high?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're just restoring the
neurotransmitter imbalance that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is enough data already published
which shows that yes it lowers the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of epileptic attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that 35 years ago in adult
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little has been done since.
[SPEAKER_01]: My son has been living with this disease
for seven years and I still talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: senators who say we have to be careful,
we have to go slowly and I don't think we
[SPEAKER_01]: can expect patients to wait for years for
a medication that's already available to
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this thing called sudden
unexplained death with epilepsy that they
[SPEAKER_02]: just die, bang, they're gone if you don't
have these things under control and so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's one of those scenarios where you just
got to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my goal now at Chillray is to make sure
that we develop these cannabis derived
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been black market for so long that we
don't have a good way to track this and so
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what we're trying to do here is to
change that, is to genetically sequence
[SPEAKER_02]: all of these strains and then tie those
down to the cannabinoids and terpenes that
[SPEAKER_02]: they make and track that throughout time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have that information and you
start going down the epilepsy route
[SPEAKER_02]: without it, you're going to go through all
types of surgery and invasive procedures
[SPEAKER_02]: or go through 20 different drugs before
they figure this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having the information advance sidesteps
all of that and gets you on the right drug
[SPEAKER_02]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The debate should no longer be about
whether to provide them access,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The debate should now be about how to
provide them access and I think we can do
[SPEAKER_01]: that collectively by mainstreaming this
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the really lucky ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 200,000 kids out there who still
don't have access to pure cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can no longer allow a medicine that
has been proven to protect our brains to
[SPEAKER_05]: be kept from us any longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: A special thank you to our sponsors,
Tilray and Weedmax, for supporting the
[SPEAKER_03]: conference here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can tie more science around the plant
so people don't just write it off as a
[SPEAKER_02]: hippie's dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that's actually been
studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand the plant better than any
plant in the world and then we'll start to
[SPEAKER_02]: consider maybe how do we synthesize those
in the plant and get them into compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: we trust in people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
