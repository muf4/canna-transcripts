[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CanMed 23 schedule is now live on
canmedevents.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out all the activities, meals,
sessions, workshops, and more that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: taking place at the Marriott Marco Island
Beach Resort May 15th through 17th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe me when I tell you, you do not
want to miss this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only will you get to learn from our
oral presenters who have been curated by
[SPEAKER_00]: our esteemed advisory board, but we also
have four intensive professional
[SPEAKER_00]: development workshops planned covering
medical applications of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies for fighting plant pathogens,
laboratory compliance challenges,
[SPEAKER_00]: and investment in cannabinoid innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a number of networking events
planned, including beach dinners and open
[SPEAKER_00]: bar cocktail hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have received your invitation to
CanMed 23, register today to reserve your
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have not yet received an
invitation, go to canmedevents.com now to
[SPEAKER_00]: request one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Akeem Gardner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Akeem is the founder and CEO of Canerda.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2018, Akeem acquired an industrial hemp
license from Health Canada and began to
[SPEAKER_00]: farm hemp as he embarked on his
entrepreneurial venture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allowed him to meet with the
University of Guelph professors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer of 2019 to begin the Canflavin
Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 23, Akeem will present targeting
glioblastoma invasion and survival with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-derived flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, Akeem provides a
preview of that presentation as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: insights on the following topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are flavonoids and how are they
different from cannabinoids and terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavonoids that are unique to
cannabis, also known as canflavins,
[SPEAKER_00]: why canflavins are not as well studied as
other cannabis compounds, Canerda's method
[SPEAKER_00]: for isolating, capturing, and
concentrating these molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: and potential medical applications for
canflavins and how they may work in
[SPEAKER_00]: combination with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Akeem, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Canerda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canerda is a pre-clinical biotechnology
company pioneering the discovery and
[SPEAKER_00]: production of novel polyphenol-rich
ingredients to improve chronic disease
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention and recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their research and technology unlocks the
significant anti-inflammatory,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-viral, anti-cancer, and
neuroprotective potential of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: polyphenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canerda aspires to improve health
outcomes, promote longevity, and pull
[SPEAKER_00]: humans and animals out of the cycle of
chronic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more, visit Canerda.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's C-A-N-U-R-T-A dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Akeem
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Akeem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to talk with you because
you are presenting at CanMed23 about
[SPEAKER_00]: research that your team has done into
using cannabis-derived flavonoids or
[SPEAKER_00]: canflavins to treat cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get too deep into that,
I always like to start with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be especially true here
because I know that canflavins are not as
[SPEAKER_00]: well known as other cannabis compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are flavonoids or canflavins?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll start with flavonoids and
we'll get to the canflavins in a second,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But nice and sweet, flavonoids are a class
of polyphenolic secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_01]: found in most plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're commonly consumed in the diets
of humans and animals, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been consuming them since the
beginning of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chemically, flavonoids have a general
structure of a 15-carbon skeleton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which consists of two phenyl rings and a
heterocyclic ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the key important differentiation here
is that it's a completely different class
[SPEAKER_01]: of molecules than the more commonly
well-known cannabinoids or terpenes that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are familiar with from cannabis
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so structurally, they're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: How else are they different from
cannabinoids and terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's really the structure and I
guess their activity and how the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: uses them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually these molecules, they have high
antioxidant properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant uses them as part of their
defense mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't work on the endocannabinoid
system, at least in the same way as our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and our terpenes do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a different class of molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what makes them unique for
exploration when it comes to people
[SPEAKER_01]: exploring the synergistic effect of full
plant extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to understand this synergy,
you need to be able to understand all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different components of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that includes these polyphenols or
these flavonoids that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, how many different, I mean,
I don't know if you could put a number on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but how many different flavonoids are
found in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are they unique to cannabis or are
they found elsewhere in other plants as
[SPEAKER_00]: well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just like, much like the
cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavonoids, there's a whole bunch of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're found all across plant
species, all across the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what makes cannabis hemp unique is
that they have very specific or unique
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where we get to our can
flavins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our can flavins aren't found anywhere else
in the plant life, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And included with the can flavins are
other molecules that we might get to a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still beans, but benzyles that are unique
to cannabis hemp, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, these unique molecules are what we
believe adds to the high therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of the cannabis hemp plant that
humans have experienced from the beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: of time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why they continue to come back to cannabis
as a treatment for a variety of different
[SPEAKER_01]: indications, because specifically in the
synergistic profile of this plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, are these novel molecules that are
known to help with human and animal
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, are there certain can flavins
that are, you know, more well known than
[SPEAKER_00]: others that folks may have heard about
before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not can flavins, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, can flavins are the more
specific molecule, but flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably yes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are molecules like the epigenin,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cursor tin, reservoir troll is a more
recently well-known flavonoid because of
[SPEAKER_01]: its promise in regards to longevity
research, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruten was first isolated from oranges in
the mid-19, I think it was 1960s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the first, one of the first
flavonoids to be identified in the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are more well-known ones,
but flavonoids as a whole, people aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: really familiar with, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just know to eat their fruits and
vegetables because they're good for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, so you mentioned a few there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there flavonoids that are currently
being used as therapeutics or for other
[SPEAKER_00]: indications?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of exploration around them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, reservoir troll, the most
commonly known one, has shown in different
[SPEAKER_01]: assays of zebrafish and sea elegans to
have a lot of promise when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: longevity, neuroprotective properties,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But researchers around the world,
scientists around the world, and as you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, most prevalent with natural health
ingredients in general, there's always the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem of translation and always the
problem of doing something with enough
[SPEAKER_01]: specificity to be able to get FDA approval
as a registered therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the work is out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are exploring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, in September I went for the first
time ever to the World Polyphenol
[SPEAKER_01]: Conference, and this is an annual
conference every year where people come
[SPEAKER_01]: and they talk about all the different
science from all around the world and the
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers that exploring this really,
really unique class of molecules and what
[SPEAKER_01]: they can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, did I hear you right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it difficult to really isolate these
compounds to really kind of study them
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, and especially when you're
looking at cannabis hemp, yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: More broadly, when it comes to natural
health products and natural health
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients, ingredients found in the
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of challenges about
batch-to-batch repeatability.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you know that this ingredient that
you get from one plant is the same as the
[SPEAKER_01]: other plant, so on and so forth,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this makes the exploration of most
plant-based molecules challenging in
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we look specifically at
industrial hemp cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce flavonoids at a very,
very minimal profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, our Canflavin, so when we talk
about Canflavins, I'm usually talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about Canflavin A and B, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And these molecules are found in under
0.014% of the plant's biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're extremely minute, extremely
rare, and that makes isolating them,
[SPEAKER_01]: capturing them very challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the reason why since their
discovery in the mid-1980s, there hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: been a lot of commercial or clinical work
done on these molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mainly lived in the world of academia
until professors at the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Guelph developed a few technologies that
allowed for the production of them in
[SPEAKER_01]: higher quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's these technologies that CNERDA is
the direct beneficiary of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which allows us to do the work that we're
doing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm kind of interested to learn how
you got interested in Canflavins.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it that attracted you to them,
or what opportunities did you see there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got introduced to these molecules
by chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in the right place, right time,
and I was the lucky entrepreneur that
[SPEAKER_01]: these professors at the University of
Guelph chose to be able to partner with to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring this forward, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story, less long, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a scientist by background or
training, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually went to law school in the
United Kingdom from 2015 to 2017 after
[SPEAKER_01]: graduating from the University of Ottawa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get my degree in psychology and
philosophy there, so some psychology of
[SPEAKER_01]: the mind and how drugs affect the mind I
have some familiarity with, but I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna be a lawyer after.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really when I graduated from
school in 2017 and I returned back to
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada and the legalization of marijuana
federally was amongst us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that there was an opportunity going
on in Canada to be able to be part of this
[SPEAKER_01]: emerging, growing industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an opportunity because we were gonna
do it before the bigger market directly
[SPEAKER_01]: south in the US legalized federally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said to myself, hey, if I start now,
then I can be a part of this movement of
[SPEAKER_01]: all the new innovations and everything
going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I get involved?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the hemp plant has 50,000 commercial
uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to say that's 50,000 before we add
modern technology to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really just now getting to
understand what this planet can do to
[SPEAKER_01]: accelerate and create a more sustainable,
productive world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided instead of finishing my
accreditation to be a lawyer, I was gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: use the money that I had from going to
school the line of credit to find some
[SPEAKER_01]: farmland and start to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned myself from a law school graduate
to a farmer and I started to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: No experience, just a bright idea knew
that this was coming and I got my ass
[SPEAKER_01]: kicked on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it did, yeah, it was it was a
crazy time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it did do though, was it put me
in a position of being a king,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the person with just bright ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Akeem, the person who was willing to work
hard to see this industry through right
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ultimately led to a gentleman
from Omafra, our Ministry of Food and
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural Resources, to saying,
hey, Akeem, there are some professors at
[SPEAKER_01]: the University of Guelph.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need some hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need a farmer, someone like myself,
to be able to do some investigation on
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these novel molecules that were
there in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I was like, wait,
there's something else there outside of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, hey, there's something
else there outside of the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them to my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them to take all the things that all
the plants that they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to be a part of this journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's ever the opportunity to be
a commercialization partner, I'll prove it
[SPEAKER_01]: to you that I'm the right partner to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I was able to show myself
and I was able to show our dedication,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dedication of the team that we had to
this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led them to introducing us to all
the amazing possibilities around these
[SPEAKER_01]: unique flavonoids, the can flavins,
and some of the other molecules that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to investigate and explore right in
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the technology here a way to just
concentrate the can flavins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it like breeding techniques to have
plants that produce more of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can even share.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll share, I'll share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where things get a little bit
fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this started primarily with an
extraction technology, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a patented way of isolating,
capturing, concentrating these molecules
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the plants of biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we continue to grow from 2020 when
we acquired our first intellectual
[SPEAKER_01]: property patent, to where we are now,
we also have two other ways of getting to
[SPEAKER_01]: the molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a growing production patent,
a way of enriching these molecules in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant matter right from the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have an enzymatic biosynthesis
production platform, a way of creating
[SPEAKER_01]: these molecules in bioractors purely from
scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the combination of all these
technologies give us a really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting commercial advantage
because not only can we now make these
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules purely from scratch,
but we can also make pure and authentic
[SPEAKER_01]: standards of these molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that when we're looking in the plant
matter, whether it be a grown plant or an
[SPEAKER_01]: extract, we can correctly identify and
label and say that there's this much of
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoid A, B and C, D, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what the FDA and any
regulatory agency wants to see when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing a natural health product or a
drug product to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to know that you can have batch
to batch consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to know that you have clinically
relevant assays of what each ratio of
[SPEAKER_01]: these molecules can provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives us the ability to not only
bring these molecules to market in complex
[SPEAKER_01]: mixtures, but also in their pure
individual forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to developing drugs and
therapeutics, this is where things get
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting because now we can really play
around and say, hey, what can these
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules do on their own?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can they do in combination?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what can they do against a variety of
different disease states and therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: indications?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start talking about some of that
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that the abstract that you're
going to be presenting at CanMed23,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's looking at Canflavins A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to the fact that they're
alphabetically first, what was it about
[SPEAKER_00]: Canflavins A and B that were of particular
interest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Canflavins A and B are the most
well-known novel flavonoids in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were first identified in the
mid-1980s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they were first identified by
Marilyn Barrett and her colleagues,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were found to have 30 times the
anti-inflammatory power than ASA,
[SPEAKER_01]: the active ingredient in aspirin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also later in 2014, we learned that
they had a different mechanism of action
[SPEAKER_01]: than most NSAIDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't lead to many of the GI
issues, the bleeding of the gut,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the ulcers that you get from our
NSAIDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this led to the Canflavins being at the
top of the list of the novel molecules
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the researchers at Guelph
wanted to start their research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess segueing to how we get from
inflammation to cancer, we know that not
[SPEAKER_01]: only does many chronic diseases start with
systematic chronic inflammation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we also know that some of these
solutions, some of these bioflavonoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a host of therapeutic potential
that are unexplored right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: unexplored with modern assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one professor, inventor of our patents,
Dr. Tareq Akhtar, he gave a colleague in
[SPEAKER_01]: his lab, Dr. Jasmine Lillard, along the
Canflavins to play with and look at to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, hey, could these be beneficial for
neuroprotection, for neuroinformation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jasmine did an initial screen to check
and see might they be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what Jasmine found was actually the
opposite expectation of what he was
[SPEAKER_01]: initially looking for, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That these molecules were not necessarily
useful for neuroinflammation, which we can
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about a little bit later,
but they showed promise of blocking an
[SPEAKER_01]: important receptor, the TRECB receptor,
tropomycin kinase B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this led him to believe that this
could be extremely important in regards to
[SPEAKER_01]: a variety of different cancers,
including glioblastoma multiform,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what our published paper is
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned the anti-inflammatory
properties of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that, you know, CBD is also
credited to be very anti-inflammatory the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that it acts on the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering, how do those two
compounds kind of interact?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my question is, is CBD the
only thing that's doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, obviously it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's the right way to phrase
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But was some of the anti-inflammatory
effects of CBD maybe inappropriately
[SPEAKER_00]: credited to CBD in that the Canflavins
were actually doing some of the work too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some of the excitement of the work
that we have in front of us up here at
[SPEAKER_01]: Conerta.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing is that we know,
and we know this, the literature is out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That when you look at whole plant extract
versus pure isolated CBD, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference of efficacy in the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the pure isolate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to anti-inflammation,
anti-pain and a host of other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the real thing that we want to
investigate is when you start to break
[SPEAKER_01]: down these components of the pure plant
extract, what is each constituent
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only what are they responsible
for, but how do they act in synergy with
[SPEAKER_01]: each other?
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of having a pure CBD
anti-inflammatory, or pure Canflavin
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory, can you have a combined
CBD, Canflavin anti-inflammatory?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that work on different mechanisms
that are responsible or different targets
[SPEAKER_01]: that are responsible for inflammation in
the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they work synergistically,
they're for the optimal benefit of human
[SPEAKER_01]: or animal health, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we know that some of our
work is going to start to open the doors
[SPEAKER_01]: to researchers around the world when they
start to look and explore and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: what can these molecules do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or why is the cannabis hemp plant doing
what it's doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And give them hopefully the data set that
they need when it comes to dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators and getting therapeutics passed
and approved to go to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, and that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it escapes me who mentioned it on the
podcast before, but they were looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabinoid concentrations for
certain indications and trying to isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids to try to get the similar
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even maybe even using a combination of
cannabinoids, but they weren't able to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing that they could in the
whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously their hypothesis was there
must be some other smaller compound or
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds present there that they didn't
account for that's doing some of the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey, maybe that's the canthalivins or
maybe that's something else that we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't even found yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where things get exciting,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can share, right, that there are about
15 to 20 other molecules in the plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're pretty excited about that the modern
standards of identification aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: available to the masses yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: These molecules are there again,
our canthalavin A and B are there under
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.014% of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to concentrate so much to be
able to get these out in commercial or
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily we found out we found a pretty
unique and easy way to do it, to do so to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it commercially feasible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we start to concentrate,
now we start to get to look at what are
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these other peaks that our HPLC is
identifying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can we create standards to identify
these other molecules that are there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we start to isolate these other
molecules, what can they do on their own?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they do in synergy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how can each of these class of
compounds be best used to optimize human
[SPEAKER_01]: and animal health?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we think that things are
extremely promising when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: indications like inflammatory related
diseases, cancer, cancers, respiratory
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases, neurodegenerative diseases,
sorry, I should say, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: neuroprotective qualities of these
molecules and what the next 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: 15, 20 years looks like, especially after
the rest of the world starts to legalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that again, I'm a very
fortunate and lucky beneficiary of is the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that Canada decided to go first as
the first G7 country to legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: federally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That allowed for our universities to be
able to come to my farm, take the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and say, what's there?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that in the US right now,
state to state, we have legalization and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're starting to get to the aspects of
federal legalization, at least in regards
[SPEAKER_01]: to research right now under Biden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as this continues to open up,
it just allows so many bright minds and
[SPEAKER_01]: people with innovative ideas to come touch
the plant, add their unique twists and
[SPEAKER_01]: spins to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really gonna push health care
and plant based medicine forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the things that I'm
excited about being a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're excited about that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the things that we try to
create an environment for at CanMed is to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring all people that are working on the
plant together to share their information,
[SPEAKER_00]: make connections and kind of move this
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did wanna ask you, so you brought up
again, the small concentrations that are
[SPEAKER_00]: found in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the case that a little goes a long
way when it comes to Canflavins that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need a super high dose to get that
therapeutic effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on what indication you're going
for, most probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what some of our initial data
is showing us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we have a suite of a variety of
different in silico and in vitro and early
[SPEAKER_01]: in vivo data, animal data, that's showing
us the different areas of indications that
[SPEAKER_01]: we should go after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know the concentrations and the
ranges of how our molecules work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real key now is how does this
translate to humans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are, we're bigger, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need bio distribution of these
molecules in the bloodstream at the site
[SPEAKER_01]: of actions to be able to get therapeutic
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we do that with these rare molecules?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that we can capture these
molecules at commercial and in clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a variety of different natural
health ingredients, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical ingredients that will
launch in the years to come to start to
[SPEAKER_01]: get these ingredients and these molecules
onto the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's about now in our current
investigation, it's how do we get well,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the paper that we're going to
discuss and the interference on TREC-B and
[SPEAKER_01]: how that affects a variety of different
cancers, how do we get a mixture of
[SPEAKER_01]: Canflavin A, B, C to the site of the tumor
to be able to, whether it be kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: tumor, whether it be to slow the spread,
whether it be to work as an adjunct
[SPEAKER_01]: therapy so that you need less radiation
and less chemotherapy to be able to help
[SPEAKER_01]: the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does all of this work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we're really focusing on
right now in our research up at Canarda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought that up because we're
getting towards the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even get into the abstract that
you're going to be presenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of danced around it, but let's
talk about it in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me a summary or sort of the main
takeaway that you're hoping to get across
[SPEAKER_00]: with your presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main takeaway that we're hoping to
get across is that we know that our
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids are Canflavin A and B,
and they inhibit the activation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tropomycin kinase B, tropomycin receptor
kinase B in primary cortical neurons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is very promising when it comes
to glioblastoma, but other areas of cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: research as well, like breast cancer and
pancreatic cancer as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know we have doses that can disrupt the
downstream signaling of the TREC-B
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They reduce the accumulation of
activity-regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: cycloskeleton-associated proteins,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been working in the
neuroblastoma cell line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, well, at CanMed, my hope is to
dive a little bit deeper into how we got
[SPEAKER_01]: here, to share some of the assays that we
did to prove this and show some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: more recent work since we published at the
top of the year from Dr. Jasmine LeLong's
[SPEAKER_01]: lab at the University of Guelph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you mentioned that your team,
you're interested in other compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're interested in other indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other things are you looking into?
[SPEAKER_01]: As simple as put, and I'll be very broad
here today because I do have a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: other...
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, I could actually say I
think at CanMed, you're gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear from not only ourself, but Mr. Hunter
Land in regards to what our molecules can
[SPEAKER_01]: do in areas of neurodegeneration,
longevity, and health span as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an area that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in presentation with Hunter,
we're hoping that we can show some pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: positive signs of what these molecules can
do, not only on their own, but in
[SPEAKER_01]: combination with cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of the neurodegeneration and our
anti-cancer promise, I mentioned we have
[SPEAKER_01]: some respiratory diseases that we're
looking at and the clear anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_01]: angle as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the years to come, we're hoping that
we can continue to build up momentum and
[SPEAKER_01]: show promise for our molecules so that we
can continue to explore, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: just how effective and useful these
molecules can do across a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic diseases for both human and
animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you got a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I let you get back to that work,
and before I let you go, I wanted to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you the opportunity to share any other
resources that the listeners might be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested to learn more about,
whether it's your company or Canflavins or
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the research that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, any websites or
social media that you'd like to share with
[SPEAKER_00]: the folks so they can keep up with you,
please plug away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, awesome, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our website is canerta.com,
C-A-N-U-R-T-A.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find a lot of information about
what we're doing and how we're doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the abstract that we'll be
presenting at CanMed, the main paper was
[SPEAKER_01]: published, The Interference of Neuronal
Track B Signaling by the Cannabis-derived
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavonoids, Canflavin A and B,
the lead author on that paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Jennifer Holborn out of Dr. Jasmine
LeLong's lab at the University of Guelph.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was published in February in the
Journal of Phytomedicine Plus,
[SPEAKER_01]: if anyone wants to read it there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can always reach out to me on
LinkedIn.
