[SPEAKER_01]: Limits for THC concentrations for drivers
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are those and sort of, you know,
based on your research or your knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: in the area, do you have an opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that too low, too high or?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the legal limits vary by jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, some don't have limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others have limits of blood THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC being a psychoactive component of
cannabis that's thought to impair driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five nanograms per mil seems to be the
limit that most people sort of talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Canada, we have two different
limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is two nanograms per mil, which is
sort of the lower level of offense and
[SPEAKER_00]: then five nanograms per mil, which is a
higher level of offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the jurisdictions vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have a zero tolerance, which has a
zero nanogram per mil threshold and others
[SPEAKER_00]: have two, others have five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the paper that you have mentioned,
what we looked at was whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a relationship of THC in the blood
to impaired driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, one way to deter driving after
the use of cannabis is to look at blood
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and see how that, and see what the
levels are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a police officer suspects somebody
of being impaired after cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can pull them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do a number of road signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do side tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they can take them back to a lab to
have blood drawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found, which is coming out of
the literature more and more, although
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not, again, it's not a hundred
percent one way or the other, is that as,
[SPEAKER_00]: as blood THC goes up, we don't necessarily
see an exact relationship to changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at weaving, which is the amount
of departure from a lane, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: measure that's very consistently affected
by cannabis and other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just how much you deviate when you're
moving in your lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call it weaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scientific term is standard deviation
of lateral position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at that and tried to see how
that relates to blood THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't see that there was a clear
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as blood THC levels went up,
we didn't necessarily see an exact
[SPEAKER_00]: correspondence of changes in driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were impaired at higher levels
of blood THC, others weren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't an exact relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we sort of broke it down by the
five nanogram per mil threshold and looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at those who were above versus those who
were below, we found that those two groups
[SPEAKER_00]: were different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there seems to be some merit in those
limits that we do seem to be detecting
[SPEAKER_00]: some measure of impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I have to put the caveat in there
that that was just for smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may see differences with edibles or
other routes of administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good way to look at it.
I'll be right back.
