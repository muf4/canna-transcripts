[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to talk with you today about
this wearable EEG technology that your
[SPEAKER_01]: team has developed to measure the effects
of THC in the user's brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with what inspired you to
develop this technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I was thinking about this the
other day and the main inspiration to
[SPEAKER_00]: build this technology was in 2016 when the
Canadian government was in the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing recreational cannabis
consumption and the lack of a test to
[SPEAKER_00]: objectively determine if a person is
cannabis impaired or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, we were building this
technology to detect drowsiness while
[SPEAKER_00]: driving and we wanted to help truck
companies to keep their drivers alert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were telling us about this
upcoming legalization of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption for non-medical purposes and
that they didn't have a way of detecting
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis impairment and that the current
way, which is analyzing and detecting
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration levels of THC in saliva,
urine, blood, or breath, there didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: exist a test to analyze the brain of
drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were like, okay, that's the aha
moment when we decided to pivot from
[SPEAKER_00]: detecting drowsiness while driving to
detecting cannabis impairment while
[SPEAKER_00]: driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that way, help multiple markets to
better determine if a person is or not
[SPEAKER_00]: impaired because that's the biggest issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know very well that THC remains in
body fluids for many hours, days or weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: post impairment or experiencing its
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads to inaccurate
determinations about being impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the main reason that inspired
us to build this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we build it, we realized that the
need for this type of brain wave analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: was even bigger and beyond the safety and
enforcement applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that other application was for
research to better understand the effects
[SPEAKER_00]: and the quality and the efficacy of all of
these innovative products and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, breeds and strains that the
market is developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how all this started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really to start, it was to try to
determine how impaired a driver was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ontario Brain Institute and the
Ontario Center of Innovation, two Ontario
[SPEAKER_00]: government organizations, only funded us
to develop this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we were able to build it
because I hope you will appreciate it and
[SPEAKER_00]: your audience will appreciate that in
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really, well, not many were
familiarized and believers of the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of artificial intelligence,
specifically when it's applied in brain
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the government was the one that
believed in this, you know, potential
[SPEAKER_00]: raising opportunity to, you know,
complement the current investigation
[SPEAKER_00]: process of cannabis impaired driving
determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were the ones that funded us to
build this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build it to a commercially level,
kind of a, yeah, a level of commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: viability and then conducting independent
trials to prove that AI can do this type
[SPEAKER_00]: of brain wave analysis at a way faster and
more cost effective way and accurate than
[SPEAKER_00]: a neurologist or neuroscientist doing it
individually or manually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's how all this started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was an AI component as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main differentiator and the
uniqueness of our approach, by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: because EEG technology is not really new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been used for more than 100 years,
but in the medical space, neurologists,
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroscientists, EEG technicians,
certified EEG technicians have been using
[SPEAKER_00]: it for more than 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, and in fact, we came to
this conclusion and realized that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the main reason why EEG technology has
been inaccessible to several global
[SPEAKER_00]: non-medical markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you require a neurologist and
neuroscientist and EEG technology is built
[SPEAKER_00]: for medical applications, it becomes very
expensive, very complicated to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: very slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it not commercially viable
for all of these type of markets that are
[SPEAKER_00]: also conducting some type of human
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily clinical or therapeutic,
but it's more about understanding what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of being of individuals to make
better decisions in terms of safety,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, law enforcement, product
testing, product quality testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
So that's the main reason why EEG
technology has been used.
