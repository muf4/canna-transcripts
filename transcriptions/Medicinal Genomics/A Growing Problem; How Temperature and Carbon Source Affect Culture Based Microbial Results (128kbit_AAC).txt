[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Yvonne, and I work for
Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do I hand out drink tickets,
but I also manage the R&D team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plating methods are considered to be the
gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Petri dish was invented in 1887.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phone, 1887.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the phone in 1887.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cell phone today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I told you all to take your cell
phones away, and you can only rely on the
[SPEAKER_00]: newspaper for your information,
you would think that I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet we rely on Petri dishes to give us
results for microbial testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we think that qPCR or molecular
methods aren't as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I beg to differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing on a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know what it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're a trained mycologist who has
years of training, it's very difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine what's growing on your plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you do know what's growing on
your plate, there are things that look
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, Aspergillus niger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus niger has also been mistaken
for Aspergillus brasiliensis, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were once deemed the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But through molecular techniques,
they've determined that they are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are we still doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let's bring it into the 21st
century.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we still relying on a standard
that's 135 years old?
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, salmonella testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can target portions of the salmonella
genome and run molecular methods and
[SPEAKER_00]: determine that it's salmonella within as
little of a 16-hour incubation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet if you were to confirm salmonella on
plating methods, that could take up to
[SPEAKER_00]: three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they want you at the end of three
days of plating and confirmation to send
[SPEAKER_00]: that sample back for sequencing to confirm
that your three days of plating was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some state regulators out
there that aren't allowing molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: methods for species-specific detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we making it more difficult than
it needs to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been publishing on these problems
since 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: The past eight years, this is what I do on
a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to explain and educate people why
plating methods aren't the gold standard
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody thinks that they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently, we published this past
February, and I'm going to touch upon some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that data in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go back to a study that we did
last year with Michigan in trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another problem, totals,
but we can get into that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was homogenized by a third party lab
and distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was broken up into a high, medium,
and low categories, and it was plated on
[SPEAKER_00]: three different types of plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the three different types of
plates that were used in this study,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as you can see, these three particular
plates are supposed to be isolating yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: mold fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet when you look at these plates,
you see very different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top row is DRBC plating, and you can
see there's a lot fewer colonies growing
[SPEAKER_00]: on these plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the bottom, which is potato
dextrose agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to a lab technician that doesn't know
the difference between a bacterial colony
[SPEAKER_00]: and a yeast and mold colony, you're going
to get very different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PDA, the blue dots that you see,
are counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of those blue dots that are
being counted for a total yeast and mold
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually bacterial.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some sequencing that we had done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked colonies from these plates,
and we put them through genomic sequencing
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what they actually were.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the three plates that are supposed to
be growing, yeast, mold, and fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that bacteria is indeed growing on
these plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really interesting is... Can you
advance?
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a circle that comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really difficult to see what that
circle up at the top says, but it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: actual bacteria by the name of Pantoa
alglomerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Pantoa is a gram negative,
which makes it an entero, lactose
[SPEAKER_00]: fermenting bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lactose fermenting makes it a coliform.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an entero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a coliform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has actually recently been... In 2019,
there was a publication as a growth
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have a bacteria that is used to
help grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been known to show skin
infections in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have this growth promoting
bacteria on your cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you have your trimmers come and
trim it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get skin infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done previous studies on different
microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that in 30 of the 172 microbiomes
that we have surveyed, Pantoa alglomerans
[SPEAKER_00]: has come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to look at this with an actual
ATCC culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to touch back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it was a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an entero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a coliform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, it's a BTGN.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the different states that have
regulations for those tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the top... This is states that
have a total aerobic regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are states that have a coliform.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are states that have an entero,
and I don't know why it's not showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one over here has a BTGN requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take this Pantoa alglomerans and we
incubate it, and we put it on plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this particular plate, this is a total
aerobic count plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rapid total aerobic count plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see with the manufacturer's
instructions, it says to grow it at 35
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees plus or minus two degrees for 24
hours plus or minus two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do that at the recommended growth
temperature, you can see at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, if you grow it at 30 degrees or you
grow it at 26 degrees, you do have growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If labs are following the recommended
manufacturer's documentation for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they haven't tested it in a cannabis
matrix, which Ne just said was a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be tested in cannabis matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get very different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that it was also an entero
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we grow it on the entero plates at
the recommended temperature and at two
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperatures, and you get no
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coliform plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it was also a coliform.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what happens when you plate it on
a coliform plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: 26 degrees, you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 degrees, you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 degrees, it's there, but it's minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're having labs test for these
organisms, at the recommended temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not showing up, they're
passing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a fluke.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Aeromonas hydrophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a bacteria that causes
gastroentronitis in 13% of humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, when you do QPCR methods or molecular
methods, temperature doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you detect it across the assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, why are we relying on a gold
standard that is missing stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then molecular methods, well,
why doesn't it match?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't match because you're comparing
two totally different technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did another experiment, and this was
in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Hemp sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided to test this Hemp sample,
divide 10 grams, three different bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: test it at three different temperatures,
three different plating types,
[SPEAKER_00]: three different scientists processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the QPCR method, there's no
incubation upfront for these particular
[SPEAKER_00]: tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: For species specific, that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get into that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did initial time point, and then we
incubated those bags for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: No incubation, three temperatures,
which weren't really put at their
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is showing, why doesn't it like,
OK, I don't know why it doesn't show up
[SPEAKER_00]: over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three bags, three scientists,
pretty similar results.
[SPEAKER_00]: This green one over here is an outlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that's me, but what are you
going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average CFU for these tests right
here is 150,000 CFUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that was a total aerobic test,
that would fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that was an entero, that would fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a coliform, it would fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You incubate those at their respective
temperatures for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes from 150,000 CFUs to over 6
million CFUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, what's on that flower is alive
and growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plate it, 24 hours, three
temperatures, it would pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: 48 hours, all of a sudden, you start
seeing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 72 hours, it's essentially the same as
the 48.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just a little larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's one carbon source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You change your carbon source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 2XYT agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: 26 degrees is where you're seeing that
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not seeing that 30, and you're not
seeing that 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is LB agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, similar types of results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all organisms grow at the same
temperature, which I think I clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated to you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all organisms grow in the same
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all organisms grow at the same carbon
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not all organisms grow at the same
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these three things are very important
when you're dealing with plating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not something that we have
when we're testing with molecular methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remediation practices are becoming more
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of what may be happening
here, and this is hypothesis, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I want to investigate
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I can present to you guys next
year on my findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of what may be happening
here is this viable but non-culturable
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that some of these
remediation techniques involve
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilization, whether you're using ozone,
gamma radiation, x-ray radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, hydrogen peroxide treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're knocking the organisms down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of like a boxing match,
as I'll use Zach terminology here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're knocking them down, but they're
not knocking them down for the count.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're down at the eight count.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of staggering back to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll start growing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be why on some of these
plates, at 24 hours, it's just not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you give it a few more days,
they start reviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you kind of see it in food,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You buy a pack of strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring them home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stick them in the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days later, you go to eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing could be happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because a sample leaves the lab on
day one and passes microbial doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to go sit on a shelf in a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not still continue to grow the mold or
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole point of it is that qPCR,
or molecular methods, are going to pick up
[SPEAKER_00]: these viable but non-culturable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we may be seeing, well,
how come if I use qPCR, I'm failing my
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I plate it, and there's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that is this viable but
non-culturable event that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So am I really that early?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've made up my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our team staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always looking for things to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this whole plating versus qPCR or
molecular methods isn't going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will continue to come here and
educate all you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone has any questions,
I'd be happy to answer them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
