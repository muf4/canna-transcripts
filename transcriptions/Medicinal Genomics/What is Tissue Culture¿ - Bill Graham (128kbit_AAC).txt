[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this is a propagation method
that you've been evangelizing for quite
[SPEAKER_00]: some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the emergence of hoplite and
viroid and other plant pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like now more than ever,
tissue culture is top of mind for many
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into it and let's talk about
what tissue culture is and what advantages
[SPEAKER_00]: that it may have over the cloning that a
lot of growers are doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give us a high level view of what is
the tissue culture process and we'll take
[SPEAKER_00]: it from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, happy to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ordinarily, tissue culture is going to be
practiced in four stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then incidentally, I might just take
this opportunity to kind of tell everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: what tissue culture is, especially as it
pertains to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very simply, it is hydroponics with
sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using the same nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some special amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually there may be hormones to give it
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what makes tissue culture special from
the hydroponics that growers are already
[SPEAKER_01]: doing is going to be adding sugar to give
that energy source directly to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sugar can be directly absorbed by the stem
and surface tissues without roots to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide that energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can make plants from pieces that
would be too small to clone very fast
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, because it's sugar, everything
else wants to grow on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you start seeing the
scalpels and forceps and the HEPA filter
[SPEAKER_01]: and the laminar hoods and the pressure
cookers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those things are to be able to make
the growing medium, clean the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: handle it and grow it so that the fungus
and bacteria and those things don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: back onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But given that, tissue culture is
fantastic for being able to make lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: brand new clones from a sterile source
once the plant's clean and it's growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the four usual steps of tissue culture
are going to be introduction,
[SPEAKER_01]: multiplication, rooting in culture,
and then rooting back out of culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you probably already know that I've
kind of made a little special version of
[SPEAKER_01]: that to make it easier for growers and to
make it more effective for a lot of our
[SPEAKER_00]: producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a completely high level,
what we're talking about is using small
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces of an established plant to make new
copies of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not too dissimilar from what you would
do with cloning just with much smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, it's funny, I'm actually
calling it tissue cloning because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: using tissue culture to clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of part of the shortcut
that I've made up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is to top veg plants,
taking a two or three centimeter cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: off of the top so that the plants will
branch, which is valuable for indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is primarily for our vertical
growers, but works for anybody who is
[SPEAKER_01]: raising plants indoors and vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's putting a tip cutting directly
on to your rooting medium, which is sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of a shortcut of the usual four stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
