[SPEAKER_01]: Explain a little bit more about the
methodology behind your toxicological risk
[SPEAKER_01]: assessment that you're performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So toxicological risk is a component of
the unique hazard risk of each ingredient
[SPEAKER_00]: coupled with the exposure level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always like to describe this in terms
of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are all very familiar with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, ethanol, that is the
compound that has the inherent risk in
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we understand the toxicity of
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you compare with the exposure level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, one glass of wine,
you're probably going to feel totally
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll wake up the next day, feel totally
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go about your day, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very low exposure to ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the risk is very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then let's say, you know, after I do
my presentation, I'm really excited,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to celebrate and I drink a whole
bottle of wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a much higher exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I'm drinking that bottle of
wine, I might lose a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: balance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I might say things that I think are really
funny, but maybe not be so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next day, when I wake up,
I'm probably going to be very dehydrated,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, I have a really great
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the end of the day, I feel totally
fine again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the risk between you know, a glass of
wine and a bottle of wine is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher because we're doing we're getting
exposed to a higher level of that ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the idea behind a risk
assessment, because nothing and I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing in this world is 100% safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important to understand the
inherent risk of that individual
[SPEAKER_00]: component, but then also to understand how
much of that component, how much of that
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient can a consumer be exposed to
without having any risk or without having
[SPEAKER_00]: any like, you know, the risk is at a
negligible level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the methodologies that I employ here at
True Terpings includes surveying all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the publicly available data on each
individual ingredient, compiling all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: reading it, understanding the conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I perform a set of calculations,
which is very standard in toxicology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these calculations do things,
for example, if it was a study with a rat,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to understand what that means in a
human.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a calculation to put it into the
levels that a human would be exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I need to put it into the exposure of
a cannabis consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand how much is a cannabis
consumer vaping every single day?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of this extract are they being
exposed to every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really important calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once I get that answer, from the
human exposure level, I apply a set of
[SPEAKER_00]: uncertainty factors, or safety factors,
they're sometimes called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that means is we found this
limit from a study where there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: adverse events to the rat, but we're not
100% sure if a rat is totally equivalent
[SPEAKER_00]: to a human.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna apply this uncertainty
factor, which brings this no effects level
[SPEAKER_00]: down, let's say 10 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's 10 times smaller limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna be more conservative limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can be more confident that that
limit is not gonna cause harm to our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumers in the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a brief overview of what
a toxicological risk assessment is and how
[SPEAKER_00]: I perform that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your example with alcohol,
you were mentioning how ethanol is sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: the compound that can cause harm,
I guess, for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're looking at...
So when you're looking at alcohol,
you're looking at ethanol.
So
when you're looking at alcohol,
you're looking at ethanol.
