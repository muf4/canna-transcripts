[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, we welcome back TJ Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: TJ is the VP of R&D at Abstracts,
a company that specializes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: research, development, and production of
botanically-derived and cannabis-inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: TJ and his team recently published a paper
that identified several non-terpenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that are responsible for the
unique aromas associated with exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of cannabis, including the
berry, tropical, candy, and fruity notes
[SPEAKER_00]: found in zittles and gelato, as well as
the rich, intense chemical scents found in
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties like GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: This research opens up a new world of
aromatic compounds and challenges the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of classifying cultivars based on terpenes
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss how
cannabis aroma affects consumer and
[SPEAKER_00]: patient experience, the variety of aromas
the cannabis plant can produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how it compares to other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We define exotic cannabis varieties and
compare them to more prototypical
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discuss why terpenes alone don't tell
the entire aroma story in exotic cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, how to communicate information
about non-terpenoid compounds to consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: and patients in a meaningful way,
and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to my conversation with TJ,
I'd like to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Agilent Technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manufacture or test cannabis,
you face the challenge of delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: high-quality products, increasing sample
volume, and meeting emergent regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agilent offers best-in-class cannabis and
hemp analysis solutions featuring robust
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments, software, services,
and consumables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their team of experts can develop,
implement, and optimize methods to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: up and running quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at Agilent.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without any further ado, please enjoy my
conversation with TJ Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, TJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited to talk with you today about
cannabis aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people love it, some people hate it,
but it's an important part of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and a key differentiator
between different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you joined us on the podcast last year,
link in the show description, and you also
[SPEAKER_00]: presented at CanMed23, link in the show
description, about the compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the sometimes divisive,
skunky, gassy aroma of certain cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now your team is back with another
study looking into the sweet and savory
[SPEAKER_00]: smells of some cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into that, I wanted to
give you the chance to explain to the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience why aromas are so important to
cannabis and why they're important to you
[SPEAKER_00]: and your team at Abstracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so cannabis aromas really,
I mean, they're really responsible for
[SPEAKER_02]: driving that consumer experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when consumers are purchasing,
whether that be concentrates, vape pens,
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, pre-rolls, they're maybe buying
these based on how they like how it smells
[SPEAKER_02]: and tastes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And to understand more about why it smells
the way it does and tastes the way it
[SPEAKER_02]: does, we want to understand more about the
chemistry behind these aromas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And understanding this research is really
important to us as a company because we
[SPEAKER_02]: have an extraction facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we create flavor and terpene
blends for various customers, but also
[SPEAKER_02]: just really we're curious to see like,
why does, I mean, we understand why OG
[SPEAKER_02]: smells skunky and gassy, but why now do
GMOs smell garlicky and savory?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do zittles and runts and all other
exotics, tangies, smell fruity,
[SPEAKER_02]: tropical, gassy oranges?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, where are all these smells of aromas
coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: And can we start correlating the chemistry
to the human sensory aspect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as a company, when we start
working on this for about two,
[SPEAKER_02]: three years now, before we published it,
but really is around like November 2022,
[SPEAKER_02]: we started seeing regulatory agencies come
out with new regulations stating that
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis was not fruity or sweet or
savory, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen this in California,
and this isn't anything malicious,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just because there was no data and
information showing that out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing labs couldn't really test for it,
and there's no publications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we knew we had all this data in
house and we're working towards this
[SPEAKER_02]: publication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, we really need to tell the
story right and show people that,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, there is more to the plant than we
may understand at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we know why it smells and tastes
grapey, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does GDP have that grape note?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does blackberry kush have those dark
berry notes?
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand the chemistry is behind
this, and this is important, powerful
[SPEAKER_02]: information, not only for regulators,
people doing cultivation, genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole gambit of the industry could
benefit from this information,
[SPEAKER_02]: because then you can utilize this to
better improve products and consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you look at publications like
Addy Ray and Ethan Russo's publication
[SPEAKER_02]: they're looking at, they show that the
consumer experience at how good that
[SPEAKER_02]: experience is for the consumer,
how positive it is, was correlated to how
[SPEAKER_02]: positive they perceived the aroma to be,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So understanding more of this is gonna
help give better experiences to not only
[SPEAKER_02]: existing consumers, but new entry
consumers coming into the industry who may
[SPEAKER_02]: be interested to try cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm glad you brought up Ady Ray and
her study there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a guest on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a link to that one, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can really go down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was really interesting
where, yeah, she would have folks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: study smell different types of cannabis
and rate how good they thought they
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled and then actually consume it and
kind of rate their experience and saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation where if you like the way it
smelled, you tend to like the experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was pretty powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just going to show that
understanding more about why it smells and
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes the way it does is super important
for whole wide-ranging different product
[SPEAKER_02]: types and our understanding of this
industry and trying to, again,
[SPEAKER_02]: empower consumers to make more educated
decisions and get better experience with
[SPEAKER_02]: the products, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of people who've been either
in the industry or have consumed cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people have bad experiences and
bad stories, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if we have more education and more
understanding of what's going on,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can avoid those circumstances and those
those bad experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned regulators and sort of them
talking about how cannabis isn't fruity or
[SPEAKER_00]: or savory or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was there something on the table or
push to sort of regulate cannabis products
[SPEAKER_00]: that are maybe too fruity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know, for example, here in
Massachusetts, with tobacco, you can't buy
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was there a similar idea going on with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in California, there was regulations
in a regulated California cannabis market
[SPEAKER_02]: that are saying that if cannabis doesn't
have, you can add flavors to cannabis that
[SPEAKER_02]: are not natively present, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like blueberry, blackberries,
darkberries, grapes, redberries,
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries, a whole gambit of various
fruits and sweet flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, at the time, it wasn't done
with any mal intent, but rather the
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific knowledge just wasn't out there
in the marketplace, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're looking at making
decisions on not flavoring product because
[SPEAKER_02]: you or whatever reason may be,
you're looking at it from what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let's keep it smell and taste the way
it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're coming at the context of
what a testing lab tests for or just the
[SPEAKER_02]: individual terpenes and gassy skunk from
like the classical prototypical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're missing this whole realm of new
exotic genetics that have been created
[SPEAKER_02]: over the past few decades, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot of genetic breeding
work being done that have pushed the
[SPEAKER_02]: boundaries on cannabis cultivars to make
them way more sweet and fruity or way more
[SPEAKER_02]: savory and garlicky and push those edges
to see what else the plant is capable of
[SPEAKER_02]: producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really important to kind of
establish at least a baseline for what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's able to produce so that we sort of
know, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like again, the regulators can
look at this type of work and see and
[SPEAKER_02]: understand, hey, there is more to this
than just the basic terpene panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also as an extractor, if you're trying
to make a better extract and you're only
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at terpenes, those are hydrocarbon
based.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole lot of other more polar
species like the esters we discovered
[SPEAKER_02]: here, volatile sulfur compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you understand more of the chemistry,
you can start to change and adapt your
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction processes, your growing and
curing processes if needed, or even your
[SPEAKER_02]: packaging scenarios, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you understand more about the volatiles
and what's there and you want to preserve
[SPEAKER_02]: something for a longer shelf life,
if you're only measuring things like
[SPEAKER_02]: limonene and myrcine or beta-carofalene,
you're not capturing these more volatile
[SPEAKER_02]: notes that consumers may be looking for,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As we saw in AD raise study, there wasn't
a correlation between the top three
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes and their consumer's preference
of the experience, but rather just the
[SPEAKER_02]: preference of the overall aroma of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think most cannabis consumers by now
are familiar with terpenes and sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: role that they play in the experience,
the smells, and you know, even the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you point out in the paper that
terpenes are only telling a small portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of the overall story and that sort of some
of these attempts to classify cultivars by
[SPEAKER_00]: their top terpenes weren't really working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speak a little bit to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I mean, if you look within the
study, we were trying to measure a broad
[SPEAKER_02]: variety of exotic cannabis cultivars,
everything from as sweet and fruity as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible, get something that is dark
berry, something that has tropical notes,
[SPEAKER_02]: something that has weird citrus notes like
tangy, but also prototypical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can look at some of the exotics
and some may be tropical and others may be
[SPEAKER_02]: dark berry and they have a lot of either
limonene or one of these major three
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, but they don't smell the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you go to the savory front like
GMO and other savory exotics, they also
[SPEAKER_02]: have similar top terpenes, but their
overall aromas aren't anything close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that doesn't mean that the terpenes
don't impart any flavor aroma at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't part of the research publication
itself, but we did some studies in our lab
[SPEAKER_02]: just to see what would happen if we
stripped all the terpenes out and did just
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this going to smell and taste like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straight up, it didn't smell and taste
like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unbalanced and had a very weird
nondescript experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just very unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not until you have everything there
that it has all the balance of what the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant intended, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have all the everything basically
working just harmoniously together to give
[SPEAKER_02]: it this full experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you strip out that core base of what
makes cannabis unique, even though
[SPEAKER_02]: limonene may not correlate to the exotic
specific nature, it doesn't mean it has no
[SPEAKER_02]: impact to the flavor and aroma of cannabis
that we all know and appreciate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having it all there is super important,
but it's not the defining features of what
[SPEAKER_02]: makes it exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's required to give it that full
experience, but it doesn't help to find
[SPEAKER_02]: that exotic note.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that is coming from those esters
and these other new compounds we
[SPEAKER_02]: discovered in this specific study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like music where maybe your
terpenes are your drum kit and your guitar
[SPEAKER_00]: and your bass guitar, but it's really the
synthesizers or the other instruments that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're layering in on top of that that
makes it a unique musical composition.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly how we started to explain it
to a lot of the customers in our sales
[SPEAKER_02]: team we've been working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we try and bring this complex
chemistry and bring it to layers down,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way to explain it is just like that,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a symphony and you strip out
your string quartets, your strings or your
[SPEAKER_02]: brass, you're still going to have music,
but is it the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like terpenes, they are absolutely needed,
but they're not the most only thing
[SPEAKER_02]: representative of all aroma, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where, again, the study came in to
show that, hey, terpenes, yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have importance and value,
but there's more we haven't been
[SPEAKER_02]: considering as an industry that play a
significant role that we should start
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned it earlier that
extraction techniques might be favoring
[SPEAKER_00]: certain compounds versus other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you sort of dial that in to make
sure that you're still capturing some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these minor compounds that are
contributing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, it's tough, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have analytics with your
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you understand the compounds that
are there, if you want to dial in your
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction, you can test out different
parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we can see is, say, we're working
on, say, GDP, very purple, grape-heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: type of smell and aroma,
methylanthronylate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If in one extract you see
methylanthronylate lower than it should be
[SPEAKER_02]: when you want to increase it, well,
you can change some parameters and monitor
[SPEAKER_02]: that specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use a specific compound to see,
hey, are we capturing this more
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately, and can we change our
parameters to address this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, again, by having all this
information, you can start to ask these
[SPEAKER_02]: questions on how do we improve processes
to start better capturing or emphasizing
[SPEAKER_02]: these notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about the terpenes,
and now that there is these extra minor
[SPEAKER_00]: non-terpenoid volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speak a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there different classes there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these compounds completely unique that
haven't been found elsewhere, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: unique to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you actually finding them in other
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the majority of these, I mean,
these are all found in a botanical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of plants in the world,
right, in things like blueberries,
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries, other things like basil.
[SPEAKER_02]: These all produce terpenes for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have some in there, right,
but also other flavorants like aldehydes,
[SPEAKER_02]: esters, ketones that impart different
notes that make each plant unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis isn't the first plant to
produce these, at least not that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen, but it does have a broad diversity
of aromas, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never picked up two basils,
and one smells like basil, and one smells
[SPEAKER_02]: like a fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basil is basil, whereas cannabis has this
weird, broad range of different aromas
[SPEAKER_02]: that a lot of plants, at least from what
we've measured, I'm not claiming to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: world's expert in all plants, but it does
have this huge broad diversity in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with this study, we did find a lot
of these different esters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, they're known in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only ones that we didn't see a lot in
other recorded nature, a lot of what are
[SPEAKER_02]: the synecuates.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are what would be, if you're
thinking in the context of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what makes zittles different from a
lot of other fruity cultivars,
[SPEAKER_02]: how it has that sweet, weird, uniquely
zittles candy note to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That in particular, I mean, it has a lot
of those synecuates, which are a type of
[SPEAKER_02]: ester flavorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now your typical cannabis testing lab,
do they have the equipment available to be
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for these sort of things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most cannabis testing labs, they for sure
have a GC, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they're doing a lot of their
solvent testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be doing some pesticide testing
on there for the volatile pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of them tend to have a GCMS
single or triple quad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in theory, they could test for some of
these compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have the methods built out for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not, just because there hasn't
been a real need or even real demand,
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say, from the industry to test
for these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't until we came with this
publication that even we started getting
[SPEAKER_02]: asked now more, we started hearing more
conversations about esters, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: At first it was the prenatalated BSEs,
like what makes cannabis smell skunky and
[SPEAKER_02]: gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's, hey, we know more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what else can we test for and
understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now are there standards available for
these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can procure standards available
for these, because a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients like, for example,
methyl anteronylate, ethylbutyrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: ethyl isovalerate, these are ester
compounds that are used for a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: grapes and dark berry flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are used in the traditional flavor
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a knowledge of how to use them and
we have them on site because we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional flavor house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously we work a lot with cannabis
companies, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with a lot on creating different
flavors or products for, but we have all
[SPEAKER_02]: these in-house and a lot of other
companies do as well, and there do exist
[SPEAKER_02]: standards for a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them not so much like the
syneculeates that are way more niche-y to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and are more newly discovered,
maybe not so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the others, I mean, there are
companies who do produce them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just because you have a standard
doesn't mean you have the method to fully
[SPEAKER_02]: separate out the complexity of this
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis produces sometimes hundreds of
volatiles, depending on which cultivar
[SPEAKER_02]: you're measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the paper mentions specifically exotic
varieties of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you define exotic?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Super broad term.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we first started this, we came into
coming into the study, like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: like two, three years ago, we looked at it
from the context of, hey, we've written a
[SPEAKER_02]: case study on jack hair like your typical
hazes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wrote our paper on apparently to be a C
compounds for the skunky gas, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we weren't answering the questions on
why a lot of cannabis smells sweet,
[SPEAKER_02]: fruity, tropical, citrusy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And not citrusy like a jack, but citrusy
in the context of like a weird tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we wanted to see like, I mean,
when we hear a lot of about exotic
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, at least in the California
market, a lot of it tends to be very
[SPEAKER_02]: fruity and sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what we started measuring.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were pulling in also prototypical
samples because you need to control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also pulled, got procured samples
of GMO because I mean, GMO is a really
[SPEAKER_02]: weird one for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also if nothing else, it is super
gassy and it's almost basically the polar
[SPEAKER_02]: opposite of a fruity exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so came in the context, well,
like let's measure these and see if we can
[SPEAKER_02]: start pulling correlations on the
chemistry of what's happening here for
[SPEAKER_02]: these various nodes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these studies, how we do these is
we have our in-house sensory panel of
[SPEAKER_02]: various cannabis consumers who have been
trained and have been consuming cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: for years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll have them go through on this
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: We gave them some, we gave them guidance
on questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We gave them a lot of free form on what
they could use.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't restrict them to any specific
terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with within reason, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some people had some pretty out
there terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to bring it in, bring it in at
least in the right realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and we correlate that to the GC data
to see, well, are there trends we're
[SPEAKER_02]: noticing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we're going to the panel,
Ian, who's the lead author on this with
[SPEAKER_02]: me, he, when he was running one of the
panels with one of our other panelists,
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve, shout out to Steve did a great job
on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going through GMO and like,
hey, we asked the panel, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you guys think of GMO?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you consider that exotic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you consider like a fruity exotic or
a prototypical?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, it's kind of neither,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it's, and if you think more about
GMO, it's not true OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a bit different from like a typical
OG Kush or a Skywalker OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody was like, you know,
it is more savory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there, maybe we need better terms to
describe this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's when we started looking into
an understanding, well, we know GMO was
[SPEAKER_02]: referenced as garlic, mushroom,
onion, cookies, cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's some chemical explanation
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started looking more into the data
and we said, that's how we discovered
[SPEAKER_02]: scatol and indole and cannabis,
which are used.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's really driving those weird,
unique aromas of GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scatol is most commonly associated with
feces, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives feces that poop smell to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just happens to also be in GMO and
a lot of these weird savory exotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's at a level, it's such that it
doesn't smell exactly like poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has its own weird non-fruity exotic,
but more savory note to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I understand when you say exotic,
it's either sweet, savory, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: prototypical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Describe prototypical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prototypical is things like Jack Harers
and Hazes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that citrusy, piney,
turpenic note.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very quintessential like sativa types,
if you would frame it as such a sense,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as OGs on the other prototypical
spectrum having that really woody,
[SPEAKER_02]: earthy, gassy, and some pine citrus notes
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more, even some other cultivars that
have like the spicy notes, spicy herbal
[SPEAKER_02]: notes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like either some things like hemp,
which are very herbal, spicy, or even
[SPEAKER_02]: other things like gorilla glues that
again, these are all good cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not exotic, but they're very
spicy, very earthy and herbaceous and with
[SPEAKER_02]: some floral notes to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like your prototypical exotic
has that may have those similar bases,
[SPEAKER_02]: but layered on top of it are those fruity
esters or heterocycles like indole and
[SPEAKER_02]: scatol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to ask you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think when I edit this,
I'm going to put up the visual that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have in the paper that sort of shows a
spectrum of all these different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis with different peaks for
different aroma notes, because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really great job you guys did putting
this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it fair to say that the prototypical
ones might have fewer of these
[SPEAKER_00]: non-terpenoid volatile compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more sort of reliant on the
terpenes or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the context of like hazes and jack
hair for sure, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It has, it doesn't mean it's devoid of all
esters and other compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still have, like hazes tend to have a
lot of cherry propanol in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is it offers a mild, tiny amount of
fruitiness because they have just a small
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are, these are cultivars that
have been around a while and they weren't,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were never really bred to have more
exotic fruity notes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are really classical strains that
have been around a while that really own
[SPEAKER_02]: that specific flavor notes of and they do
drive a lot, derive a lot from terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're again, things like alpha pining for
pine, terpenaline for those terpenic
[SPEAKER_02]: notes, limonene and others for some of
those citrusy notes that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: combination with the other terpenes that
are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, other prototypicals like OGs,
gorilla glues that are, they do have a
[SPEAKER_02]: skunky gassy note.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they do have prenatal VSCs that aren't
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have a lot of terpenes there that
give a lot of space note, but it does have
[SPEAKER_02]: that really strong defining aroma that
everybody, even non-cannabis consumers
[SPEAKER_02]: know that's skunky note or gassy note,
depending on how you perceive it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's coming from the perinolated sulfur
compounds that are not terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you mentioned before that you,
I want to make sure I got this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You removed the terpenes and then smelled
it and it was sort of strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done the opposite where you sort
of eliminate these non-terpenoid compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: and leave just the terpenes or is that
sort of obvious because we have isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done both, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were first on our paper,
the perinolated VSCs, the gas paper,
[SPEAKER_02]: we on our sensory panel did some that were
without perinolated sulfur compounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: so just terpenes and some that had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it still has like that basey cannabis
terpene note that's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just feels incomplete.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like it is not a full profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have some of those defining
features as a consumer that you would be
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we added the perinolated VSCs,
it definitely got a lot closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we went into the exotic ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you add in more of those other
flavorings, you're just getting closer and
[SPEAKER_02]: closer to that concept of like biomimicry
of getting really close to replicating
[SPEAKER_02]: that exact flavor and aroma of the plant,
whether it's for creating a product or
[SPEAKER_02]: just improving your extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you do strip out like all those
terpenes, it's because esters are really
[SPEAKER_02]: there for complexing that base out to give
it that fruity nuance.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you consume cannabis, it doesn't
taste like you're literally eating a
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely has strawberry notes to it,
but it has other flavor notes of the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes that are there or in some cases,
the perinolated VSCs in the context of
[SPEAKER_02]: like some of the gassy strawberry
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you remove out the gassy component
and all the terpenes, it just is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just, it does taste weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't taste like a real strawberry by
any means or a real fruit, but it does
[SPEAKER_02]: taste like this just weird mixture of
somewhat fruitiness, but just no defining
[SPEAKER_02]: features.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, so we mentioned before that
obviously genetics plays a huge role in
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but is how the cannabis is grown or,
you know, how good the grower is,
[SPEAKER_00]: does that sort of contribute to how much
of these sort of non-terpenoid compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be present?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely not a cultivator by any
means, but I would assume so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these, cause the plant isn't just
producing these automatically,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are secondary metabolites,
meaning the plant is producing it for some
[SPEAKER_02]: biological reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also needs nutrients to grow and
produce these compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd imagine depending on what nutrients
you feed it is going to impact the
[SPEAKER_02]: expression of some of these secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine light potentially impacts it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you, how you cure it definitely
impacts it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you over-dry something, these are,
a lot of these are really volatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes it to the end consumer may not
have it anymore because it got too dry or
[SPEAKER_02]: the packaging wasn't properly sealed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole variety of things that
could impact, especially in the raw
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the actual flower itself,
if it has these, by the time it makes it
[SPEAKER_02]: to the end consumer and genetically would
love to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know from talking to Kevin over
medicinal genomics, that's a really
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated question.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot involved there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is there any potential for these
compounds to maybe serve sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic function?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there has been thoughts about
terpenes in the past and there's been
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that sort of look into linking
terpenes to certain therapeutic value and
[SPEAKER_00]: the data is a little inconclusive,
but I know that there's, with can flavins
[SPEAKER_00]: and other things that there is some
potential there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could these also show some promise?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything is possible, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do we know today if any of these
compounds have a specific medical impact
[SPEAKER_02]: in the context of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know the definitive answer
today, but it doesn't mean that they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have an impact and they possibly might,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, consumers are, if they're
purchasing for a medical purpose,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is also what drives us publishing
some of this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're purchasing cannabis based on a
medical ailment and you have your specific
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar, you know is what you need to
help treat your ailment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you would need, it's based on,
I would imagine, some of these secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolites, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're choosing that specific
cultivar because that's what works for
[SPEAKER_02]: your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the market, a lot of THC content is,
I mean, most cultivars are really high in
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't normally typically change too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you have some that are CBD rich or
have minors, but the broad majority of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis tends to be THC rich,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that tends to differentiate are
sometimes some of the terpenes in the
[SPEAKER_02]: context of hazes versus some exotic or
OGs, but also these are secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who knows, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen publications from De De Miri
that show some extracts have better
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-cancer properties than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: The THC and CBD may be the same,
but everything else there is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is causing those differences?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the data shows there are
differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may just not understand what exactly
that is yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe they play in combination with
THC, maybe having the cannabinoids present
[SPEAKER_02]: with these various flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what unlocks those medical
benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of questions to be asked and
answered still, but now that we understand
[SPEAKER_02]: more about what's in the plant,
we can at least start asking these
[SPEAKER_02]: questions and answering some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now from a consumer perspective,
do you think it'd be valuable to start
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting on different levels of these
certain compounds or that be sort of too
[SPEAKER_00]: deep in the weeds or should we just smell
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it smells good, then we kind of let
the nose do the analytics for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I'd say like two inches at one
definitely depends on the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some markets where you can smell
cannabis before you buy it, like Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's deli style.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smell anything you want before you
buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: California, we don't have that luxury
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all pre-packaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have no idea what it's going to
smell or taste like before you buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to commit to buying that 30,
50, a hundred dollar product before you
[SPEAKER_02]: even know if you're even going to like it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've asked ourselves this question
for the past three, four years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is this, are these compounds
meaningful to an end consumer?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of compounds in here as,
I mean, we are obviously, we're a terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand we should know more about
this than everybody, but even internally,
[SPEAKER_02]: like if I was to go into a store and see
all these flavorants on there,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I might know just because I worked
on this study, but a lot would have been
[SPEAKER_02]: just because there's so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've worked on taking that complex
data because we have the GC data and the
[SPEAKER_02]: sensory data from these studies and seeing
if we can come with more meaningful ways
[SPEAKER_02]: to simplify and deliver this information,
more meaningful matter, like how exotic or
[SPEAKER_02]: how fruity is this cannabis cultivar on a
zero to a hundred, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it has ethylbutyrate, methylene,
threonine, 3-mercaptohexanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I put those on a bottle of consumers,
I'm like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What dangerous things are you giving me,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just, it sounds scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a chemist, so it doesn't sound scary
to me, but I'm not foolish enough to think
[SPEAKER_02]: that all consumers understand all these
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can put in a more meaningful
factor, like how gassy is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: How fruity is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: How hazy is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when we've done this with some of the
products we work on in California,
[SPEAKER_02]: it does have at least a more simplified
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, just looking at cannabis having
hundreds of compounds, and having on
[SPEAKER_02]: there, it has these many micrograms of
this compound, it's gonna be tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be really tough unless you were
to deconvolute it in a more educated
[SPEAKER_02]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then later on top of that,
the way that they interact with each other
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce a different aroma too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's no way that the average
person would be able to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'd even argue unless you're like
somebody who spent their career in flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry, or flavor science, or perfumes,
really nobody would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's so many, unless you are
somebody who's constantly making products,
[SPEAKER_02]: and flavors, or perfumes, to just look at
these long names with percentage,
[SPEAKER_02]: they wouldn't need percentage points,
all these are PPM level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's tiny, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And know that hey, with having these 30
compounds in there, and also think about
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself going to dispensary, you're
looking at maybe 10 to 20 different
[SPEAKER_02]: products, by the time you make a
purchasing decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking at a sheet with 20,
30 different compounds on it, across 20
[SPEAKER_02]: different products, that's a lot of
information to address.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would just be overwhelming to
really most people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just thinking about a new entry
consumer, talk about something incredibly
[SPEAKER_02]: daunting, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're putting a pretty daunting task in
front of them, unless, and again,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what we've been working on inside
my group, is how do we take that complex
[SPEAKER_02]: information because we have all this data
to support it, and put in something more
[SPEAKER_02]: digestible and more simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people can, again, on the hey,
I want something fruity and exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cool, that's what you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's look at all these different,
say, fruit factor scores, or exotic
[SPEAKER_02]: scores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one has the highest, or maybe you
have a spectrum, which one has the certain
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor and aroma notes you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winding down here, so what is it that
you and the team at Abstracts are looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, first, obviously, we're using this
to try and get our cannabis flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: products to have higher levels of
biomimicry getting closer to replicating
[SPEAKER_02]: that exact flavor and aroma of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to use this information to improve
our extraction processes, whether that be
[SPEAKER_02]: tackling cannabis, or if we want to
extract some other plant, like hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: If now that we understand these compounds
that are there, we have the GC methods,
[SPEAKER_02]: we understand the sensory behind it,
can we use this to improve extracts?
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, I mean, taking all this data
we've aggregated from our few studies now,
[SPEAKER_02]: can we come up with, and we have come up
with some consumer-facing metrics for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cultivars that explain what
something smells and tastes like before
[SPEAKER_02]: you purchase it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for markets like California,
where you are reliant on a bud tender
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping they'd consume that product,
they may not have, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The dispensary has hundreds of products,
but if we can provide education for
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers to make more educated decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and before I let you go,
I want to give you the chance to plug any
[SPEAKER_00]: additional resources that you think the
audience might be interested in reading up
[SPEAKER_00]: on, and any websites, social media for
you, and Abstracts, please plug away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so if you want to read any of our
publications, anytime we do a scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: peer-review publication, we always make
sure to put it up for open access,
[SPEAKER_02]: that way everybody in the industry can
benefit from this work to improve their
[SPEAKER_02]: processes, products, or just better
understand cannabis, because we all enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: it and it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: On abstractstech.com, that's where we hold
all our products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under our science pages, we have not only
the work I've talked about here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but some of the case studies we've worked
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've worked on a couple case studies
looking at what makes jack hair smell and
[SPEAKER_02]: taste the way it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looked at understanding when you do
different extracts of what's the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between flower, live resins of
a butane extraction, or live rosin of the
[SPEAKER_02]: same cultivar grown the same way we just
took that lot and split it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have case studies like that up on our
website that ENB Publishes open.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're free for anybody to download and
read, just so we find them interesting and
[SPEAKER_02]: hope everybody else does too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, and we definitely
appreciate the fact that you guys do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you guys continue to participate
in CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really excited to have you down,
