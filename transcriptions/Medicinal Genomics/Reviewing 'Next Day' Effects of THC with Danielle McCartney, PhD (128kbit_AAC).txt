[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CanMed 24 Innovation and Investment
Summit returns to the J.W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marriott Resort in Marco Island,
Florida, May 12th through 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are excited to announce that
registration opens October 6th.
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed 23 was our first time at Marco
Island and the feedback was overwhelmingly
[SPEAKER_00]: positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beach, the food, the amenities,
the networking opportunities, and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course the content presented were all
exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CanMed 24 is shaping up to be even
better, featuring new dedicated networking
[SPEAKER_00]: events, new workshops, and a number of new
faces sharing the latest research and
[SPEAKER_00]: innovations in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't yet, head over to
CanMedEvents.com now to sign up for email
[SPEAKER_00]: alerts so you don't miss any of the
announcements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you in Florida this spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Dr. Danielle McCartney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danielle is a postdoctoral research
associate at the Lambert Initiative for
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University
of Sydney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her main role is to coordinate clinical
research into the effects of cannabis on
[SPEAKER_00]: simulated car driving performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danielle and her colleagues recently
published a systematic review of the study
and suggested that the study's analysis of
the new method of performing
[SPEAKER_00]: safety-sensitive tasks is a critical
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some government agencies and experts
recommend individuals avoid performing
[SPEAKER_00]: safety-sensitive tasks for at least 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should not surprise you to learn that
the data suggests a much shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment window.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discussed the
different types of studies the authors
[SPEAKER_00]: reviewed, and the criteria they used to
evaluate them, the different tests
[SPEAKER_00]: administered to measure impairment,
how next day effects of THC compare to the
[SPEAKER_00]: acute effects, how next day effects are
different in medicinal cannabis patients
[SPEAKER_00]: versus recreational users, what methods
are available to determine THC impairment
[SPEAKER_00]: in drivers, and what is the reasonable
impairment window for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Danielle, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Medicine Women Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine Women's team of specialists
includes medical doctors, naturopaths,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis experts, nutritionists,
and alternative health practitioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: These integrative teams evaluate health
issues and design targeted protocols to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote personal healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine Women's protocols have
successfully alleviated symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, autoimmune diseases, and
neurological conditions, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: providing overall health rejuvenation.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danielle McCartney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you recently published, or you and your
colleagues recently published a review of
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that have investigated the next
day effects of THC on cognitive function
[SPEAKER_00]: and safety sensitive tasks, which is a
topic that has implications on a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different policies, which I'm sure we're
going to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I'm curious to learn a bit more
about your background and why you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues were interested in studying the
next day effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I'm a research fellow at the
Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: Therapeutics, which is a philanthropically
funded center for medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: research at the University of Sydney.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the Lambert covers or studies a
whole wide range of different areas
[SPEAKER_01]: related to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess most of my research falls into
the sort of cannabis and driving domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the effects of cannabis and THC use is
sort of a hot topic in that domain at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence our review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned cannabis and driving,
which is certainly a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, let's maybe not get into that
quite yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the results of your
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many different studies were you
able to look at and what were sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: main takeaways there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so as you said, our review looked at
what we consider to be next day effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, we were looking to identify
any interventional studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So studies where either cannabis or THC
had been administered in some form and
[SPEAKER_01]: then participants had been required to
undertake or perform some kind of either
[SPEAKER_01]: simulated safety sensitive task.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like driving or there's some
studies on simulated aeroplane flying or
[SPEAKER_01]: some more sort of standard and common,
I guess, computerised cognitive tasks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a wide variety of those sorts
of activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to be included in the review,
studies had to have done this and measured
[SPEAKER_01]: performance at least eight hours following
cannabis use, because that's sort of what
[SPEAKER_01]: we consider to be, I guess, your typical
overnight recovery period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so studies, most of them administered
the tasks between sort of eight and 12
[SPEAKER_01]: hours following cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some administered all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often they conducted testing at multiple
time points.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might have measured at 12 hours and
then 24 hours and sometimes all the way up
[SPEAKER_01]: to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found a total of 20 studies that had
done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot were published quite some time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little bit of recent work,
but largely historical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they measured quite a number of
different outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was several hundred different
sort of or administered, sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: several hundred different tasks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's across all the studies at all
the different time points and under all
[SPEAKER_01]: the different cannabis conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often the studies would administer one
dose of THC on one study and a different
[SPEAKER_01]: dose on one arm of one study and a
different dose, a different arm in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you end up with like, you know,
the amount of data sort of just increases
[SPEAKER_01]: exponentially as you start to include
these different arms and different time
[SPEAKER_01]: points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it turned out to be a reasonably
large undertaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's what we included in our
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were the results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you finding that people were impaired
after eight hours or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the vast majority of studies showed no
next day effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was across a variety of different
cognitive tasks and safety sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: tasks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And safety sensitive, sorry, simulated
safety sensitive tasks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a small number of studies that
detected next day effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess an important element of this
review is not just to look at quantity,
[SPEAKER_01]: although they were overwhelming majority
showing no next day effects, but also to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the quality of the studies and
what they're sort of showing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we looked closely at this sort of
small number of studies showing subtle
[SPEAKER_01]: next day effects, they tended to be not
such.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of them were randomized controlled
trials, for example, which is our most
[SPEAKER_01]: rigorous form of interventional study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they often and they didn't tend to
have to employ the best sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: standardization procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I mean by that is we're really
interested in making sure that the studies
[SPEAKER_01]: we were sort of reading into used didn't
allow their participants to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: consume alcohol 24 hours prior to
undertaking tasks, caffeine, stay up all
[SPEAKER_01]: night, all of those things that can go on
to affect cognitive function.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to be sure that they had been
controlled out of the sort of context.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the gist is that the studies
that did show next day effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: which there were very few of, tended not
to be great quality whilst there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple among those showing sort of no next
day effects that were quite good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that seems to be where the evidence is
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine they probably established
some baseline performance and did they
[SPEAKER_00]: also study kind of acute effects of the
THC too and compare those?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was another element of our view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you say, they admit, as I've sort of
said that when they've administered their
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment cannabis or THC or whatever
they've chosen, often they'll administer
[SPEAKER_01]: these cognitive tasks or safety sensitive
tasks at several different time points
[SPEAKER_01]: following use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whilst our next day effects review was
primarily interested in those tasks
[SPEAKER_01]: administered more than eight hours post
THC use, we did also pull all of the data
[SPEAKER_01]: that were available on the more acute
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they administered the same tasks one
hour later or two hours later,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you much more likely expect to see
impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we did this was because we
wanted to know well, okay, if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: showing no next day effects, we want to
know if the studies have also seen acute
[SPEAKER_01]: effects because if you haven't seen an
acute effect, your probability of seeing a
[SPEAKER_01]: next day effect seems really, really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by collecting the sort of acute data,
we were able to get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: insight into whether or not sort of the
doses being administered were impairing to
[SPEAKER_01]: begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the tasks being used to assess
impairment were sensitive to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we didn't get a lot of I
guess there was quite a number of tasks
[SPEAKER_01]: that didn't show, or I guess quite a bit
of, what would you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we found that a lot of them didn't
show acute effects, if that makes sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: or either didn't show or didn't measure
acute effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think 20% of our tasks, the tasks we
identified, I hope that made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a bit confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at the the study that you
published too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like there were quite a bit
of different tests that were administered
[SPEAKER_00]: to sort of measure this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like almost a dozen or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are some of these better indicators
than others?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your sort of your thoughts there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are certain tasks that seem
to stand out as being better for
[SPEAKER_01]: identifying impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of our tasks would be,
you know, simulated driving, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: an ecologically valid way in which to look
at impairment, you're taking someone and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting them in an activity that they
would typically or that you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: see them impaired on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually using that specific task
is kind of ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main thing that we look at when
we're measuring sort of simulated driving
[SPEAKER_01]: performance is a marker called standard
deviation of lane position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is basically how much lateral
movement the vehicle makes as it's moving
[SPEAKER_01]: along the road, sort of swerving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to be quite a sensitive
measure of impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, in terms of the
computerized tasks, one of the areas that
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to show up quite a bit is
information processing speed seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: quite heavily affected by THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, for example, a task of information
processing speed might be something one we
[SPEAKER_01]: use in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll see if I can explain it because
it's always hard to explain to even
[SPEAKER_01]: participants, but I'll see if I can make
sense of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like a pattern generating task.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see on the computer screen a series
of patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the computer will say,
OK, I want you to produce pattern one and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to use the keyboard to make that
pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you sort of identifying and copying and
coordinating a few responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that tends to be reasonably sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas kind of at the other end of the
spectrum, our more sustained attention
[SPEAKER_01]: type focus tasks seem to show a little bit
less impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's hard to compare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the main thing when you these
kinds of tasks is that participants are
[SPEAKER_01]: really thoroughly familiarized to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you can kind of mask impairment
with learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, no, and it's interesting when you say
driving, because that does seem to be sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of one of the main problems you're looking
to solve for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to kind of at least
comparing the next day effects to the
[SPEAKER_00]: acute effects, what are you seeing in
terms of acute effects of THC on driving
[SPEAKER_00]: performance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it seems to vary somewhat
depending on the population that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: studying, dose THC used and the route of
administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: On average, we would sort of say that THC
tends to be impairing in the acute phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do note that regular cannabis users
seem to experience less THC induced
[SPEAKER_01]: impairment than occasional cannabis users,
likely due to the development of
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance, but also that lower doses seem
to produce less impairment and the timing
[SPEAKER_01]: at which impairment peaks varies depending
on whether THC has been inhaled,
[SPEAKER_01]: which usually as quickly after,
whereas orally ingested takes longer for
[SPEAKER_01]: that impairment to sort of ensue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's interesting you bring up
kind of inhaled versus edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that is there a difference in the
next day effects of inhaled versus edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, like you said, it does take
longer to to kick in usually with an
[SPEAKER_00]: edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done a previous review looking at
the duration of impairment that focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: the sort of less than studies looking at
the effects of THC less than 12 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: following use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we conducted that review,
we did see that oral THC induced
[SPEAKER_01]: impairment lasted longer than inhaled.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the review predicted that impairment
from orally administered sort of THC would
[SPEAKER_01]: still subside within sort of about eight
hours, depending on the dose provided that
[SPEAKER_01]: was with about a 20 milligram dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at our current sort of next day
effects review, we didn't sort of see any
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns of studies that administered THC
orally being more likely to detect
[SPEAKER_01]: impairment than those that administered
THC by inhaled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could just be because it was beyond
that eight hour window.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them were relatively likely to be
recovered within that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no real pattern emerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main sort of driver seems to be the
quality of the studies that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I know in the paper you had said
that, you know, whether it's some
[SPEAKER_00]: lawmakers or potentially employers,
they sort of give some guidance of you
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or operating heavy machinery within 24
hours of using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like based on the research,
that window is really eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what our research seems to suggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, provided the doses, you know,
within reason, it becomes a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly 24 hours seems quite
conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of data to support that as far
as we can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and it's a good point, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one that you brought up
earlier is the difference between a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis user and, I guess,
an adult use recreational user.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is certainly looking for an
altered effect, which would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: produce impairment, whereas the other
one's looking for a therapeutic effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: which might be at a lower dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really important point to raise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the research included in our
next day effects paper was based on
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy individuals who use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them occasionally, some of them
regularly, but all for primarily sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just on the basis that there
was no studies looking at medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is basically the picture across
the driving sort of space and cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: the research area and driving and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's very little research looking
at medicinal cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you say, that population could
respond quite differently, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when compared to recreational users,
medicinal cannabis users are often,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're using the products on a
very regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's good opportunity to develop
tolerance to its impairing effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're typically using lower doses to
avoid rather than induce intoxication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also experiencing a clinical
benefit, you know, some improvement in
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms that might, you know,
themselves impair driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like pain and insomnia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely an area that warrants
further sort of exploration and something
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're very interested in.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that, you know, a former,
a CanMed presenter, Dr. Stacey Gruber,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that she has done some work in
this, in this area, and she's even
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated that some medical cannabis
users perform better in cognitive tests
[SPEAKER_00]: after taking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of, a lot of things going
on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it's a really interesting
area and they could react quite
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not totally surprised by that
finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it all comes back to this idea of,
I guess, trying to keep impaired drivers
[SPEAKER_00]: off the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and it seems that lawmakers
or law enforcement is really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fixated on, on finding a biomarker to kind
of determine cannabis impairment,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like a blood alcohol or
breathalyzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your knowledge, are there any
biomarkers that are reliable or that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're, that we're close on for determining
cannabis impairment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that still a bit of a holy grail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're talking biological,
like in some kind of fluid biomarkers at
[SPEAKER_01]: present, no, we just, we don't really have
anything that's particularly good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the most commonly looked at things are
probably urine, blood, and oral fluid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urine is probably the worst of the lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that THC and its metabolites
persist in urine for a really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really long time, particularly among
regular users, you know, comfortably over
[SPEAKER_01]: a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood is not particularly good either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can hang around in blood for extended
periods of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is largely because THC,
so it's a lipophilic molecule,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning that it likes to get into fat and
sort of stay there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it accumulates in people's fat stores
and then just sort of slowly leaches into
[SPEAKER_01]: blood, meaning that it can be there for,
again, weeks and sometimes longer after
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oral fluid is a tricky matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sort of has some benefits, I guess,
in that it is the matrix that THC leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: most rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take someone who only very
occasionally uses cannabis and administer
[SPEAKER_01]: an acute dose, you probably find that it
persists in oral fluid for a few hours and
[SPEAKER_01]: then dissipates, which is kind of
consistent with impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a number of kind of
significant limitations aside from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the first being that so the
only way that THC can end up in oral fluid
[SPEAKER_01]: is if it enters via direct contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have it smoked or ingested
in some way that it actually contacts the
[SPEAKER_01]: oral fluid, meaning that if you avoid that
contact, say, for example, if the THC is
[SPEAKER_01]: encapsulated, you probably won't have any
THC in oral fluid, which means it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: marker of impairment at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other factor is that there's been
really little research looking at oral
[SPEAKER_01]: fluid THC concentrations in regular
cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what seems to be the case is that
whether THC is present in oral fluid in
[SPEAKER_01]: regular cannabis users is just it's
completely variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's there 12 hours later,
sometimes it's not detected, and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit all over the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the face of it, there are some
advantages to that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you dig a little deeper,
it sort of falls apart really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we don't currently have a
particular good way of identifying
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis impaired drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, would something like a field sobriety
test be a good standard?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's certainly the direction that
we're heading.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want to measure or
identify impairment, the thing that you
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe want to be looking for is
impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the tests are able to tell
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tricky thing is identifying something
that can be carefully standardized across
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, you know, if a police
officer asks people to stand on one leg,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're going to get huge
variations in how people are able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it might depend on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain disabilities could affect it and
all kinds of different things,
[SPEAKER_01]: even just age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's not going to be you
can't stand there with a stopwatch and
[SPEAKER_01]: times I want to go, you know, you're
impaired because you didn't stay on your
[SPEAKER_01]: leg for as long as what is typically
average.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to look for a biologist,
sorry, behavioral tests that vary sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: not very much from one person to the next,
because we just don't have a baseline
[SPEAKER_01]: measure or a drug free measure to compare
against in the real world in workplace
[SPEAKER_01]: settings, where they often also perform
sort of drug testing to screen out
[SPEAKER_01]: impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baseline measures may be an option because
people come back in every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be a little bit of an easier
sort of question to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think we're kind of heading in
the right direction with the behavioral
[SPEAKER_01]: tests and possibly some combination of a
behavioral and biological test might give
[SPEAKER_01]: us kind of the answer that we're looking
for where, you know, if you don't perform
[SPEAKER_01]: so well on the behavioral test,
you're given the drug test and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you have to have a look at the
results of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we'll just have to sort of see.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of interest in that area and
a lot of work being done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully we can find something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I have to imagine, like you
said, the goal here is to keep impaired
[SPEAKER_00]: drivers off the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of if it's cannabis or alcohol
or opioids or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a way to identify impairment,
again, regardless of the source is really
[SPEAKER_00]: the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, fatigue is a huge problem on the
road and we don't have a biomarker for
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it just so happens that,
you know, you can pick things like that up
[SPEAKER_01]: as well and discourage people from driving
just in general whilst impaired,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your findings being that we don't
really have good evidence that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: users eight hours after after using show
any signs of impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what sort of implications do those
results have on, you know, how employers
[SPEAKER_00]: set their drug testing policies or even
how patients or clinicians either
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend cannabis or use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of patients and clinicians,
I guess, I mean, ultimately how people
[SPEAKER_01]: take their medicine has to be dictated by
their clinical need.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess what our research suggests is
that if they are using THC containing
[SPEAKER_01]: products in the evening before bed,
which I think is quite common for people
[SPEAKER_01]: with pain and insomnia and things like
that, they should have relatively normal
[SPEAKER_01]: function the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not that's something or a
factor that clinicians want to take into
[SPEAKER_01]: account when prescribing or recommending
dosing regimes, that's their discretion,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at least that's something that they
can use to inform their decision making,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of policy for workplaces and
things like that, I mean, they face a very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar problem to the roadside drug
testing where, you know, our research
[SPEAKER_01]: would suggest that people who use
medicinal cannabis are relatively OK to
[SPEAKER_01]: function the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are still employing the
biomarkers that can produce positive tests
[SPEAKER_01]: and we don't have a behavioral
alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a tricky thing to sort of work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, our data suggests that if people
are using their medicinal product in the
[SPEAKER_01]: evening, they should be fine to function
the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what they do with that
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you mentioned, too, that in
looking at these studies, a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: were maybe poorly designed or didn't have
proper controls and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'm going to put you a little
bit on the spot here, but if you were to
[SPEAKER_00]: design the perfect study, what would that
look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it depends a little bit on your
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we'll start with healthy
individuals who might use cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: recreationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there were a couple of quite good
studies that our review identified in this
[SPEAKER_01]: space and I think a similar design to what
they've employed would be appropriate
[SPEAKER_01]: where you sort of, I think you take your
population of healthy individuals who use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis occasionally, allow them to
consume cannabis, probably as they usually
[SPEAKER_01]: would, sort of add libidum in quantities
that reflect their usual use and then keep
[SPEAKER_01]: them overnight in a sleep lab or something
like that and then look at how they
[SPEAKER_01]: function the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think ideally, I mean, in a fictional
world, you'd probably, and I say fictional
[SPEAKER_01]: because in Australia, I'm not allowed to
do this, but you'd probably use an on-road
[SPEAKER_01]: driving test to assess impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's something that the
experts are over in the Netherlands
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's super ecologically valid and
sensitive to impairment and well
[SPEAKER_01]: researched and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be a great way, I think,
to look at next day impairment and the
[SPEAKER_01]: overnight sort of component ensures that
participants aren't out doing things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want them doing during that
overnight period, continuing to use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, drinking alcohol, staying up all
night, all of those things can affect the
[SPEAKER_01]: results of the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that would be one approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the medicinal uses is a bit more
complex to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I mean, maybe I'd say ideally
you'd take people who were just initiating
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments and titrate them up to a dose
that they find efficacious, whatever that
[SPEAKER_01]: may be, and then assess performance once
they're on that sort of maintenance dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: either 12 hours later or 12 hours
following placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you'd even have a couple of arms
where people weren't sort of chronically
[SPEAKER_01]: treated and initially you put them on a
placebo, titrate them up to a therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: dose, and then administer either THC and
placebo and look at impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would give you sort of four groups
to compare, but that one would be quite
[SPEAKER_01]: the undertaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, need some funds to support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess there is a difference
between measuring impairment the following
[SPEAKER_00]: day and the quote unquote cannabis
hangover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine there's a difference there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could still feel some after effects
the following day, but it might not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily be impair, impairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why we've used the phrase next
day effects throughout, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really blurry as to whether or not we're
looking at, you know, the, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: tail end of impairment, or if we're
looking at hangover kind of, effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when you study alcohol hangover,
you can, you know, administer a dose of
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol and then test that someone has a
breath alcohol concentration of zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that, okay, we're no longer
measuring the acute effects of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're now measuring the effects of alcohol
hangover.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really blurry in the cannabis
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the term next day effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't completely separate them,
but I know, so one of the, she's now a
[SPEAKER_01]: postdoc here, but at the time she was a
PhD student, she recently completed a RCT
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the, I mean, the primary aim of
the trial was to look at the effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC and insomnia or medicinal cannabinoids
and insomnia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she did look at the sort of next day
effects following evening dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe there was a subtle effect
for the treatment to increase next day
[SPEAKER_01]: feelings of sedation, which might kind of
capture some of those measures you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But interestingly, when they administered
the, what's called the maintenance of
[SPEAKER_01]: weightfulness test, which is the most
boring task that you can ever administer,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically participants have to stare at a
wall for 45 minutes and try not to fall
[SPEAKER_01]: asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did that several times the next day,
those four participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's considered sort of the most,
it's considered an objective measure of
[SPEAKER_01]: next day alert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so despite having that subtle increase
in sedation, maybe that was the wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, but that was sort of what they
reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't detect any effects on the
maintenance of weightfulness tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could be right where you can feel
possibly not 100%, but still be functional
[SPEAKER_01]: if that makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually, that's actually
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes in line with what we were
talking about with fatigue being a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: With driving performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, you know, even if you weren't
under the acute effects of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you were fatigued as a result,
that would be an issue too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like that's, that's not the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can stare at the wall for 45 minutes
and not fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was a good night's sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll discuss that once the
publication has officially come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably shouldn't share too much,
but yeah, really interesting findings
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's still to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, speaking of things to come,
I'm curious what research you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: on now and what we can expect to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few different things, but I guess the
overall theme is that we're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: moving into the, you know, medicinal
cannabis user sort of space within the
[SPEAKER_01]: context of driving and safety sensitive
tasks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you've said, there's this issue of,
you know, biomarkers of impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we identify that on the roads?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that we're interested
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also interested in, you know,
whether medicinal cannabis users are in
[SPEAKER_01]: fact impaired when they use their
treatments as instructed under,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, careful medical supervision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that we'd like to
investigate further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's probably the main sort of
things at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I let you go, I wanted to give
you the opportunity to share any other
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that are sort of related to the
topics that we talked about, and I'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to put them in the show notes for
people to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there's a website or any way to get
in touch with you, if people want to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect, please plug away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I guess we have the Lambert Initiative
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure if people go to Google and
type in Lambert Initiative, they'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should link people to our ongoing
clinical trials, probably our sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitter page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that that's quite active at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And should allow you to get in touch with
any of the researchers at the Lambert
[SPEAKER_01]: Initiative that you might like to speak
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm definitely going to put a link to
the study in the show notes so people can
[SPEAKER_00]: dig into the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Danielle, thanks again for
getting up early and talking to us.
