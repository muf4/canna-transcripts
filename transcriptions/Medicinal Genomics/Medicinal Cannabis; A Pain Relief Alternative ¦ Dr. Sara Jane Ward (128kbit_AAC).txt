[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Sarah Jane Ward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an assistant professor at the Lewis
Katz School of Medicine at Temple
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the Center for Substance Abuse
Research, also in the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research that I do at Temple is using
animal models to study the safety and
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy of molecules from the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many of the therapeutic targets that
we investigate in the laboratory,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are not very many treatment options
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some of the disorders that we're
investigating in the laboratory,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as chemotherapy-induced neuropathic
pain, for example, there are currently no
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA-approved treatments for this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's really important to do some
good basic science research to see if this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a viable treatment option that can be
approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the 2017 CanMed conference,
I plan to share some of the research that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been conducting over the last several
years at Temple in my own laboratory in
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with many other scientists
here, specifically investigating the
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic potential of different
components of the plant for the treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: of various CNS disorders that specifically
have an inflammatory component to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the topics that I'll be talking
about are our results in animal models of
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic pain, as well as animal models of
spinal cord injury, traumatic brain
[SPEAKER_00]: injury, and stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons to attend conferences
like the CanMed conference are to really
[SPEAKER_00]: get an appreciation for how much research
is going on in the area of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing I'm surprised about when I
talk to people who are outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: basic science field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're unaware that there is so much
research going on, both at the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: science and clinical level, to understand
the safety concerns associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis, as well as the potential
therapeutic efficacy that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: discovering in our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a substance abuse researcher,
I had my own concerns about the abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: liability of marijuana or different
therapeutics based off of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through attending many scientific
conferences, talking to colleagues,
[SPEAKER_00]: reading scientific articles, it's
definitely shifted my opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I think almost every time I talk
to people, other scientists, other people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the general population, when people are
exposed to the kind of research that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going on and the kind of results that are
being obtained, I think by and large
[SPEAKER_00]: people's attitudes are shifted,
or certainly their minds are opened.
