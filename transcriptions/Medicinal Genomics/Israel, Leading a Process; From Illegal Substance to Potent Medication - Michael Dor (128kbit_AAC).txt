[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's quite a moving event because
exactly 25 years ago, I graduated here
[SPEAKER_00]: from Kennedy School during my master in
public administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to come back after 25 years to this
city and to this event, thank you very
[SPEAKER_00]: much for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to call my lecture from illegal
substance into promising medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a process that we are only beginning
and it's fascinating process and we must
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it was said a minute ago, we are not
supposed to wait to collect all the proofs
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a family physician, an active one for
the last 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow I'm flying back and Friday
morning I'm going to see patients again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the good administrators in
medical services and researchers should
[SPEAKER_00]: see patients in wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would give them the perspective of
the human relationship and all things
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Israel became kind of pioneer in this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we owe all the thanks to Professor
Moshulam, who was the first one to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe, to find THC and his research are
guidelines for us all this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with him even today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In two occasions that I attended,
I was told by other people, not Israelis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that Professor Moshulam ought to have a
double price for his work, but that he
[SPEAKER_00]: will never, I'm sure this audience is
sympathetic, but he will never get it
[SPEAKER_00]: because of this being such a sexy,
but also problematic issue about
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told this story to Professor Moshulam
and he laughed very much and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, those who think so are not
sitting in the Stockholm Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israeli 8.5 million population during the
last 10 years, we approved almost 50,000
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm speaking about license because Israel
is also obliged by the international
[SPEAKER_00]: convention of narcotics and we cannot
allow it to be medication until the
[SPEAKER_00]: international approach will be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that you, with your research and
with the change of the attitude of the
[SPEAKER_00]: American states, one after the other,
the United States should lead this change
[SPEAKER_00]: in the international bodies and then
everything will be a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, in my office, since being
the chief medical advisor to the Israeli
[SPEAKER_00]: Minister of Health, I signed all those
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, not a prescription,
but a license to have illegal substance
[SPEAKER_00]: for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day on my desk, we have between 200
to 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a holiday, Passover,
as you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm expecting coming back after the
holidays to have about 2, 3,000 requests
[SPEAKER_00]: on my desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I don't do it by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: 27,000 are active patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active, I mean they took the substance
from the dispensary during the last three
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were speaking this morning about the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a tremendous pressure from the
media and from politicians in Israel,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but I suppose partially it's also
here, to promote the cannabis usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last two years, we have a health
minister, Rabbi Litzman, a religious Jew,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when he came to the office,
I asked him, please, I need to update you
[SPEAKER_00]: for new things in the market, in the
medical field, and his first reaction was,
[SPEAKER_00]: he calls me Mickey, we worked together in
previous assignments, and Mickey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hear a word about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took for him two weeks in the office to
call me urgently, please come here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know everything about it,
because every media person every
[SPEAKER_00]: politician doesn't want to speak about
anything else, just they ask me about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, mostly for members of their
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very crucial point,
we presented our minister a plan,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was later on adopted by the
government, and since then we are
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting this area, I mentioned it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very enthusiastic about research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I serve as a member in the research
committee, which we have the honor that
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Meshulam is the chairman of this
committee, and during the last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: we approved 130 research proposals,
30 out of them clinical studies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: now in process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to speak much about it,
you know this single convention of
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotic drugs, the Israeli legislation
can be something which is different,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the governmental decision allowed us
to use it according to the Ministry of
[SPEAKER_00]: Health indications, instructions,
rules, whatever you want to call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of them are published in our web,
so every physician and every patient can
[SPEAKER_00]: look and say, look, according to the
ministry's instructions, I am entitled to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, and they do it, we have a
problem with old fashioned physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you say, you can't teach old dog new
tricks, that is the verb, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go from one meeting to another in
hospitals, HMOs, weekends, my wife likes
[SPEAKER_00]: it very much, we spend the weekend,
I give a lecture, and I'm trying to teach,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nothing is mentioned in medical
schools, and this is part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another problem is this mix up of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we talked this morning, there is this
recreational issue, there is the medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the medical side only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time I appear in the parliament,
being the representative, the senior
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of the Ministry of Health,
the politician asks me, what about
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational usage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my answer is always, look,
I'm a physician, I'm in charge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical part, the recreational use is a
social decision that should be done by
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians, elections, whatever you say,
not by me, not by physicians, but when
[SPEAKER_00]: they press me, well, you cannot sit here
as a senior representative of the ministry
[SPEAKER_00]: and not having an opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I say, okay, it will have its costs,
like an alcohol, like nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The social decision was that you can sell
liquors to every person over 18,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, you have the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a lot better than alcohol,
but it has its own price as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few numbers, the evolution of the
numbers, number of requests during the
[SPEAKER_00]: last two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in my office for the last four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was increased from 32,000 to almost 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: Licenses, as I mentioned, almost 28,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average amount, and this is very tricky
figure, because I'm never sure exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: when we approve 20 grams, what is the
percentage of THC or CBD in those grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is quite a tricky number.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our instructions for the next year,
it will be mentioned very specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the last year, at least legally,
we dispense almost one ton of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: 928 kilos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average amount for patients is 33
grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some heritage from my friends that
were running the subject before,
[SPEAKER_00]: with people getting up to 200 grams a
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I have doubts about the person
using such amount alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually have help.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evolution of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, more patients,
smaller doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not worth photographing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waste of administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the pictures disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most probably illegal picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inhalation, sublingual and oral.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't allow until now skin
preparations, and we are very afraid of
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our general director of the ministry was
very concerned about the problem that the
[SPEAKER_00]: grandchildren eat grandma's cookies,
which could be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to mention that if you think what,
how do you want it to be taken?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is a development now of
Israeli startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not tell the name, and I don't have
any part in this company, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prepare inhalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know this, like Ventolin or those
asthma treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this inhaler with small heating
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose most of you know that in order
to reactivate the substance, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat it to 184 Celsius degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They build a small device which makes the
heating, and then he can inhale exact
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that in the next few years,
we will stop this smoking issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: which as a physician, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give it in inhalation or many other
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to get cannabis in Israel?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very structured process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every specialist in the country can
recommend a cannabis within his own
[SPEAKER_00]: specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oncologist, pain control physician,
neurologist, pediatric neurologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: psychiatrist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs to fill a form, computerized
form, and send it to our office with the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole medical history of the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I insist on the medical history?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because many times, the prescribing
physician is a very distinguished
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist, and he knows everything about
neurology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows nothing about the psychiatric
condition of the patient or his lung
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that purpose, I insist on having
the whole history of the patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we can check and approve the usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case of psychiatric history,
when here I come to the main
[SPEAKER_00]: contraindication today, severe psychiatric
problems, a history of addiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: are, in our opinion, a relative
contraindication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I say relative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some psychiatrists can say,
okay, he was once he has a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now he's okay, we can give him
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he's in unstable condition,
maybe not at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have difference of opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Resnik, who is here, he believes that
it's almost not existent, very small
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others say more, but some say that between
one to 10% of patients with preexisting
[SPEAKER_00]: psychiatric conditions, they tend to be,
well, not hospitalized, but they need
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is today the most significant
contraindication to medical treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that in few years,
that we'll know more about the subtypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean about maybe some types of THC will
be consistent with this situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 15 physicians working for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see all the applications,
and after they approve it, it comes to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to my signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I'm the only one allowed to
sign it because all other physicians
[SPEAKER_00]: refused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was a tremendous pressure,
intimidation for them, you must approve
[SPEAKER_00]: it, otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got all the pressure on me,
and my wife got during the night all the
[SPEAKER_00]: phone calls, the nasty phone calls,
telling her what they think about my
[SPEAKER_00]: mother, which is not true, I promise to
you, but we survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The license, after I sign, is transferred
to one of the eight companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have eight companies distributing
cannabis to the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of treatment day,
each one needs to have a teaching,
[SPEAKER_00]: one hour teaching how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that in many cases, people didn't
use it correctly, and at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't enjoy the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: After they learn how to use it,
the percentage of success is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it is a license, and since we want
them to be followed by their physician,
[SPEAKER_00]: we ask to renew the license, I mean to
renew the request for a continuation of
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment every year, sometimes every six
months in special cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically a medical decision,
what is the interval between the follow-up
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase of dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the years, most of the patients ask
for higher doses of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided that it will be done gradually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw one of the presenters yesterday,
they said start low, and increase low,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, and yes, this is what
we believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted the follow-up responsibility to
be transferred to primary care physicians,
[SPEAKER_00]: family physicians like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're afraid because in those places
when it was started, a lot of people came
[SPEAKER_00]: to us for cannabis when the physician
didn't think it was appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moment you have two markets,
one medical market, one recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: market, of course there is kind of a
leakage and kind of influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned 28,000 patients being treated
according to our estimation, we have one
[SPEAKER_00]: million people who use cannabis for
recreational use, once a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: once a month, during the party,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our medical cannabis has a reputation of
being a good one, so they try to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some patients, it's quite a temptation
to sell part of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an indication committee which I
gather once a month or every two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time I ask the physician to prepare
homework, the best physician in this
[SPEAKER_00]: field, they prepare the homework and
suggestion for decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discuss it, and then if it is approved,
it appears in our web as an approved
[SPEAKER_00]: indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people ask for cannabis when
they do not fit the indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not entirely my decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a peer committee, and all those
cases that fall between the chairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: we discuss them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last meeting, we had 60 requests
and 54 out of them were approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really try to be open to things that
we don't know much enough about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This expert committee evaluates the new
indication and the old one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one case only, glaucoma, the American
Ophthalmology Association decided that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is not useful in glaucoma, it does not
reduce the intraocular pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they stopped or canceled the
indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We followed them, and this is the only
case I remember that we abolished or
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped existing indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oncology.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% of our patients are oncology patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to mention many things,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps them to stop vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you can stop the opiates,
and they don't have constipation anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can eat, they can sleep, and they
look better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find myself in the parliament
answering question, why don't you allow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for a treatment of cancer to all
the patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is not that simple to explain to
parliament members the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: treating cancer and treating symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really hope that the next few years
we'll find what types of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we help them with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the time being, it's symptomatic
treatment only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary and secondary metastatic pain,
of course, end of life, we do try to be as
[SPEAKER_00]: quick as helpful as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is quite a problem with
discontinuation of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if I have a lady after
mastectomy, she was given cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: being an oncology patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after five years, she is perfectly
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a physician, I believe she is
completely cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to stop the cannabis, it is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that much about habit formation,
but kind of dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to call it, but it is
quite a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe me, it's no good to argue with
an oncology patient especially if all the
[SPEAKER_00]: media focused on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palliative treatment, about 30% are for
treatment which was for intractable pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our instruction, we demand that the
patient will be given all the known
[SPEAKER_00]: medication, not all of them, but some of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only if you fail with the regular,
the known, the proof treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you start cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe that in a few months or a
year, we will change this rule and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis will become a first line choice
for treatment, not after exhausting all
[SPEAKER_00]: other possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the market is full of promises,
full.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have advertising telling people that
cannabis will cure every disease you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends used to say that even it will
bring you back your lost love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure this is a proper indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neurology, multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson patients suffering from chronic
pain caused by rigidity to Rett syndrome
[SPEAKER_00]: are unbelievably successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The treatment is an unbelievable success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the problems of psychosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epilepsy were approved for adults lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neurology, it was mentioned yesterday and
I was very impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the same results with epileptic
children, autistic spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a problem how to define the
spectrum, which is very wide and very
[SPEAKER_00]: undefined.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now more than 250 children treated
for interactable epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few months ago, I asked the specialist
to present the results, intermediate
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 50% of the children were,
well, if not convulsions free,
[SPEAKER_00]: so less than five convulsions a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those kids that started with 200,
300 convulsions a day, 30% the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: convulsions went down to less than 20 and
about 10 to 20% didn't enjoy the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm a physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody will tell me that you have a
treatment that is good for 100% of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, I wouldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neurology, ALS, Lou Gray disease,
fibromyalgia, which is quite a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: because the disease is not defined enough,
you don't have laboratory tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: no other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gastrochromes, I'm running,
gastroenterology, ulcerative colitis,
[SPEAKER_00]: very good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychiatry, we have more than 1,500
people, most of them victims of war,
[SPEAKER_00]: soldiers treated for PTSD following
unsuccessful psychological
[SPEAKER_00]: undertreatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They enjoy it very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of them continue the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned ophthalmology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a problem with pain clinics that
are overcrowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned our health minister,
Litzman, which he was the one to present
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the government and got its approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shortly, the numbers of our patients,
8,000 of them are treated for oncological
[SPEAKER_00]: problems directly in the hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest, as you see, oncology,
transdeseive, neuropathic pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: HIV, this is kind of symptomatic treatment
for very difficult cases, and PTSD I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Controversial issues which we have problem
with are the driving under influence of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have enough data to make
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope maybe you have, but I didn't see
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Place of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do recognize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asked by the hospitals what to do
about treating patients with smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis inside hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the physicians, some of them do
not like, the rule I made is that only
[SPEAKER_00]: with the approval of treating of the
physician in the department, he can use
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the problem of smoke alarms in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Export, I believe that will come to that
when we will make a medication out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted very much to start export,
but our foreign ministry was very much
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed against it because they were
afraid Israel will be portrayed all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world as a country exporting weapons
and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not good for our image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I finish, we are going from
substance to medicine, startup,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just one short story about older
patient, and she was given cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: not quite understood diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after months, people called her,
asked her, Grandma, does it help you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And her answer was, look, for the disease,
I don't know, but my grandchildren are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
