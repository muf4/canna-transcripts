[SPEAKER_02]: All righty, I guess I'll just get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, CanMed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Sam Hayden, and I am a research
assistant at the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work in the Berkowitz lab, where we
study the molecular genetics of flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: and trichome development in all of our
favorite plant, cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am here to discuss with you today the
mechanisms of short-day photoperiodic
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering initiation in cannabis,
and also some of the implications that
[SPEAKER_02]: these mechanisms have on the phenomenon of
the incomplete dominance of the
[SPEAKER_02]: photoperiod sensitive allele, and some of
the impacts that that has on phenotype and
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without further ado, let's begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, I'd like to start off by
describing the photoperiod loci.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say loci because there's more than
one locus that's associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering, time, days to maturity,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is a locus?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a locus is a region of a chromosome in
a genome which possesses genes which
[SPEAKER_02]: determine a phenotype, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so an allele possesses different
versions of those genes on a homologous
[SPEAKER_02]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the photoperiod sensitive allele
contains functional genes which respond to
[SPEAKER_02]: photoperiod and circadian rhythm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these photoperiod responsive genes are
dominant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does it mean to say that this gene
is dominant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it means that when the photoperiod
sensitive version of this gene is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: presence of the photoperiod insensitive
version of this gene, that the photoperiod
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive will dominate the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's due to the molecular mechanism
of the gene product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna take a look at one of the
genes that's at the photoperiod locus,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that is PRR37.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this gene was described by Lecky et al
and Aurora cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you see at the top right is
actually the ORF of the open reading frame
[SPEAKER_02]: of the protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the full length protein from
start to stop codon, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this gene contains the molecular
mechanisms that are required for the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: to respond to photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_02]: And due to the fact that it contains this
molecular mechanism, when it's in the
[SPEAKER_02]: presence of the recessive allele,
it will mask the recessive alleles
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because it possesses that
molecular mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we've got our full length gene of
PRR37, which we would find the photoperiod
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive allele.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we have the photoperiod
insensitive allele or version of this
[SPEAKER_02]: gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is still PRR37, but it contains a
splice site mutation in the gene,
[SPEAKER_02]: which results in a truncated protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this gene is unable to respond to
photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is the recessive allele.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we end up with in this case are
three different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our double dominant photoperiod
sensitive individual at the top there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this contains two copies of the
dominant allele and is fully photoperiod
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive, which results in a late
flowering phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the critical day length
indicated by the sun there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the full photoperiod dominant genotype
is not going to go into flower until late
[SPEAKER_02]: in the season when the days are short,
around 12 hours of critical day length.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there in the middle, we have our
two recessive alleles, our double
[SPEAKER_02]: recessive individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this individual doesn't respond to
photoperiod at all in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this individual has an interesting
special power that the photoperiod
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive individuals do not have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is that these individuals can
actually develop an inflorescence in
[SPEAKER_02]: response to age alone, which is something
that's super fascinating because we
[SPEAKER_02]: frequently talk about what the
autoflowering allele lacks in that it
[SPEAKER_02]: cannot initiate a responsive photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we rarely discuss what it's adding,
which enables the plant to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: develop an inflorescence in response to
age.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep that in your mind for the future
discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the bottom here, what we have is a
bit of a phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have down there is the
heterozygous individual, which possesses
[SPEAKER_02]: the dominant allele as well as the
recessive allele.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the fascinating thing that happens
when you have this genotype is that you
[SPEAKER_02]: end up with an early flowering photoperiod
sensitive plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant is still responsive to
photoperiod but it tends to be much more
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitized to photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the critical day length at which
this plant will go into flower or develop
[SPEAKER_02]: inflorescences is much longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we find that these individuals will
actually go into flower when the days are
[SPEAKER_02]: two hours longer than their full
photoperiod dominant counterparts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a pretty significant finding
for cultivation because what that
[SPEAKER_02]: indicates is that these will develop
inflorescences much earlier in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is critically important when you're
in a region which deals with mold or
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew or any of these issues that come
with the later colder stages of the
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a pretty interesting result
which is very significant for breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, developing fast flowering
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now these right here, what we're looking
at are diploids, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have two copies of each chromosome
and what we're looking at is chromosome
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, so this is the effect that we get
when we have a diploid heterozygote.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we have a triploid heterozygote,
as was established by doctors Lou Bell and
[SPEAKER_02]: Kurtz over at the University of
Connecticut, is that when we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: triploid and we have a heterozygote with
two copies of this auto flowering allele,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get an extra super duper fast flowering
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this indicates is that the genes
at the recessive photoperiod insensitive
[SPEAKER_02]: allele are dose dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that indicates is greater
transcription of these genes results in a
[SPEAKER_02]: greater expression of this fast flowering
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the dose dependency of this allele was
something super fascinating discovered by
[SPEAKER_02]: Lou Bell and Kurtz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's definitely not an insignificant
find in terms of flowering time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can see that here in this graph,
also produced by Lou Bell and Kurtz,
[SPEAKER_02]: where at the top we're looking at our
triploid dominant photoperiod sensitive
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are beginning to their terminal
flowering at around 13 hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the triploid heterozygous
individuals with two copies of that
[SPEAKER_02]: recessive allele are actually beginning
terminal flowering at closer to 15 hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: which happens much, much earlier in the
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way that plays out in the field is
that what we're looking at here I suppose
[SPEAKER_02]: if you go out into the field around mid
September and you're looking at your crop
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're going to be much, much more
pleased to see plant number two than you
[SPEAKER_02]: will plant number five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that plant number two has much,
much more robust flowers than plant number
[SPEAKER_02]: five at the same time in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a very significant phenotypic
change that occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also begs the question of what is
going on with this auto flowering allele
[SPEAKER_02]: that causes it to sensitize the
photoperiod allele in such a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why the heck does that happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a question that we set out to
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to begin, we thought we might ask,
well, what are the mechanisms that induce
[SPEAKER_02]: the photoperiod response?
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what are the mechanisms that induce
the auto flowering response?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do these two pathways not only
respond to their environment and to
[SPEAKER_02]: photoperiod, but to one another?
[SPEAKER_02]: How is the crosstalk occurring which
enables this auto flowering pathway to
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitize the photoperiod pathway?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as with all things in plant biology,
we begin to answer these questions by
[SPEAKER_02]: taking a look at Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a illustration of all the
different flowering pathways that occur in
[SPEAKER_02]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are focusing on the photoperiod
pathway down there in the bottom left.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this pathway possesses a host of highly
conserved genes which exist across plant
[SPEAKER_02]: species named gigantea, constans,
and FT, or fluorogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these three genes function in response
to photoreceptors, namely cryptochrome and
[SPEAKER_02]: phytochrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are molecules that exist in the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they're irradiated by certain
wavelengths of light, they become active.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go into the nucleus, and they
begin to activate certain transcriptional
[SPEAKER_02]: changes There's a whole host of
transcriptional changes associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: the phytochromes, but we in particular are
looking at these photoperiodic flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Arabidopsis what happens is that
during long days, these photoreceptors
[SPEAKER_02]: entrain circadian rhythm genes like
gigantea, which is a circadian rhythm
[SPEAKER_02]: gene, as well as constans, which in
Arabidopsis is a central integrator of
[SPEAKER_02]: different signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens is that gradually as the
days increase, the expression of constans
[SPEAKER_02]: increases, and along with the expression
of constans comes an increased expression
[SPEAKER_02]: of this gene FT.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because constans is a
transcriptional activator of FT.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a pretty well established
pathway in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Arabidopsis is a long day plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arabidopsis goes into flowering on long
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very different from cannabis and
other short day plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the difference in particular is
displayed here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a model from rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may seem inappropriate to apply a
model from rice to cannabis due to their
[SPEAKER_02]: obvious unrelatedness.
[SPEAKER_02]: But interestingly, we've actually found a
significant number of sort of homologous
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanisms and homologous genes between
rice and cannabis, not the least of which
[SPEAKER_02]: being this gene PRR37, which we mentioned
before, which possesses this molecular
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanism which responds to photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_02]: And due to the fact that it responds to
photoperiod, it's critically day length
[SPEAKER_02]: gated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that indicates is that it has a
biphasic function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has one discrete function during
long days and a completely separate
[SPEAKER_02]: discrete function during short days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, so does constans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been able to see that this sort
of pattern is present in both rice and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that it's not entirely
unreasonable to suggest that this
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanism is likely conserved between rice
and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're proceeding forward using this
model as the most likely way for short day
[SPEAKER_02]: photoperiodic flowering initiation in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way that this works is that there
are one or more genes expressed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf whose protein products actually
directly interact with the content and
produce the effect of the substance.
And those are these long days.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually working together to
produce a constans gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that prevents constans from performing
its function of upregulating FT.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how things are working during
long days.
[SPEAKER_02]: During short days these circadian rhythm
genes are affected and the expression
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns of these repressors fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens is they release their
repression of constans, allowing constants
[SPEAKER_02]: to go ahead and upregulate FT.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a critically day-length gated
biphasic function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a result, we thought that it would
be wise to start trying to identify
[SPEAKER_02]: critically day-length gated genes or genes
which have significant expression changes
[SPEAKER_02]: based on photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then secondarily, of course,
we want to see whether or not these
[SPEAKER_02]: critically day-length gated genes are
interacting with constants directly in any
[SPEAKER_02]: way to repress or initiate flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is more or less the model we've
been working on and the model that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: continuing to study and to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a little illustration of how
that model of this putative model and how
[SPEAKER_02]: it is likely to work in the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have our happy plant,
vegetative, long days.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have constants which exists in the leaf
and it is being repressed by these
[SPEAKER_02]: interactors due to the fact that we are
under long day conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything's hanging out, just being
very vegetative, not very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then upon the transition into short
days, what we find is that these
[SPEAKER_02]: cryptochromes and phytochromes are in
training these circadian rhythm genes
[SPEAKER_02]: which are also in training the constants
gene and the result is the failure of the
[SPEAKER_02]: expression patterns of these repressors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when these repressors fail,
they allow constants to go forth and
[SPEAKER_02]: perform its function of upregulating FT.
[SPEAKER_02]: FT, fluorogen, is expressed in the leaf
where it translocates up to the meristem
[SPEAKER_02]: and activates floral meristem identity
genes like SOC1 and leafy which result in
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful trichome-laden flowers that we
love so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this here is sort of the putative model
of what's going on in the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_02]: with regards to photoperiodic flowering
initiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the photoperiod genes at the
insensitive allele, the autoflowering
[SPEAKER_02]: allele, do not elicit a response.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't do this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fail to respond to photoperiod to
modulate the activity of constants and
[SPEAKER_02]: therefore FT.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not doing that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But now here's the question that I'd like
to pose for all of you because I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really see anybody asking this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it that the insensitive allele is
causing this phenomenon of incomplete
[SPEAKER_02]: dominance?
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it that the insensitive allele is
actually modulating the photoperiod
[SPEAKER_02]: response and widening the critical day
length in heterozygotes resulting in a
[SPEAKER_02]: fast flowering phenotype?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a question worth asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have answers yet, but we're
working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably one thing to remind everybody
in the room about before we continue
[SPEAKER_02]: discussing the subject is that cannabis
actually does produce solitary flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: during the mature vegetative phase,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't actually require short days
to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: All cannabis genotypes upon entering the
mature vegetative phase produce single
[SPEAKER_02]: solitary flowers, but they don't produce
inflorescences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're really talking about when we
say short day flowering is the development
[SPEAKER_02]: of the inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And photoperiod sensitive plants simply
will not produce an inflorescence unless
[SPEAKER_02]: you expose them to short days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's impossible for them to develop an
inflorescence based on age alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in our auto flowering
individuals, we see that they obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: have that capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can grow to a certain age and then
develop an inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we constantly talk about what these
auto flowering alleles are lacking in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of their ability to respond to
photoperiod, but we rarely discuss the
[SPEAKER_02]: additive function that's coming from the
auto flowering alleles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's a really ripe
subject of study to be looking into.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's worthwhile to remember that
only one auto flowering locust has been
[SPEAKER_02]: well characterized, but there are at least
three other loci in the cannabis genome
[SPEAKER_02]: which were described and labeled DTM1,
sorry, two, three, and four by Steele,
[SPEAKER_02]: Steele et al.
[SPEAKER_02]: at La Trobe University.
[SPEAKER_02]: And DTM2, which is on chromosome two,
contains a host of SPL genes, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: family of genes which encode transcription
factors, which activate transcription.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these genes tend to activate SOC1,
which, as we learned before, is our floral
[SPEAKER_02]: meristem identity gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a master transcriptional regulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So effectively, what we're seeing is
another pathway to flowering, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, expressed in all cannabis
genotypes, but only seems to lead to
[SPEAKER_02]: age-dependent development of
inflorescences in auto flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do believe that this would be an
interesting place to look to try and
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what's going on with this
phenomenon of incomplete dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the event that you're a
bioinformatician and you want to take a
[SPEAKER_02]: look at what genes are at these loci,
here you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little map of the chromosomal
locations of DTM1, two, three,
[SPEAKER_02]: and four, where two, three, and four are
largely uncharacterized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here would be sort of like a graphical
illustration of what might be happening in
[SPEAKER_02]: these fast flowering, incompletely
dominant individuals, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the right side here, you're seeing
the photo period pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're seeing is the reaction of
these repressors of constants to the
[SPEAKER_02]: entrainment of circadian rhythm genes
during short days, activation of
[SPEAKER_02]: constants, activation of FT, floral
meristem identity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then over there on the left,
you're seeing a less talked about pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the pathway that induces
solitary flowers in vegetative plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is also more than likely,
maybe some minor differences in these
[SPEAKER_02]: genes are actually contributing to the
modulation of the photo period pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're proposing here is that this
age-dependent pathway, which depends on
[SPEAKER_02]: the expression of a couple of microRNAs,
which regulate SPLs, which regulate SOC1,
[SPEAKER_02]: that this pathway in the auto flowering
individuals might actually be having an
[SPEAKER_02]: effect on the photo periodic response,
modulating it and sensitizing it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which makes it result in this fast
flowering phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is sort of the best model we have
to work with at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a good question also is, how did we
get here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did this begin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'll tell you, we didn't start by
looking into incomplete dominance of the
[SPEAKER_02]: auto flowering allele.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember my talk from last year,
what we discussed was the use of spectral
[SPEAKER_02]: diet to try and modulate gene expression
and also biomass accumulation and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid accumulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying to see if we could modulate
red-far-red ratios and therefore affect
[SPEAKER_02]: phytochrome, the photoreceptor I
discussed, which would affect gene
[SPEAKER_02]: expression and induce changes in the
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Disappointingly, we were not able to
affect a change in biomass or yield or any
[SPEAKER_02]: other sort of phenotypic measurements that
we took.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we did find that we were able to
affect the expression of genes in the
[SPEAKER_02]: photoperiodic flowering pathway,
which indicates, of course, that they are
[SPEAKER_02]: responsive to phytochrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition, we basically found that
we were able to use this sample set to
[SPEAKER_02]: create a transcriptional map of the
changes that occur in the photoperiodic
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering genes, which results in
photoperiodic flowering, because we had
[SPEAKER_02]: samples from the leaf from pre-short days,
as well as four different time points
[SPEAKER_02]: after short days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have the meristem tissue from
the end of week one and week two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in doing this, we were able to sort of
map the transcriptional changes that occur
[SPEAKER_02]: in the leaf, which result in signals to
the meristem, which result in further
[SPEAKER_02]: transcriptional changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly, we did start to see
some strange results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost nothing makes sense, but that's a
lot of fun as a scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, things don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to find out why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the first things that don't
make sense is that we were able to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase the expression of constants
significantly by modulating phytochrome
[SPEAKER_02]: activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the strange finding is that this
increased expression of constants was
[SPEAKER_02]: correlated with a decreased expression in
FT, this floral activator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And knowing that the constants gene is
supposed to be a transcriptional activator
[SPEAKER_02]: of FT, it really doesn't make any sense
that its increased expression would be
[SPEAKER_02]: correlated with a decreased expression of
FT.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the first strange finding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Followed up by two expected findings,
which were good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that PRR37 expression decreased
significantly upon the entry into short
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes sense, because PRR37 is
putatively a repressor of that floral
[SPEAKER_02]: meristem activator gene FT, which would,
of course, be degraded upon the entry into
[SPEAKER_02]: short days, after which it allows
constants to go ahead and activate FT.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this further confirms the function of
PRR37 as a biphasic regulator,
[SPEAKER_02]: which also sort of lends to the notion
that this rice model could be an effective
[SPEAKER_02]: one for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, we see SOC1,
our floral meristem identity gene,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is significantly upregulated by day
14 following the activation by fluorogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having found these results using qPCR,
we decided to go ahead and take it further
[SPEAKER_02]: and try to identify some more critically
day-length gated genes by using
[SPEAKER_02]: bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But prior to that, we did some more qPCR
on the constants gene, which, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been discussing at length.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the constants gene in rice,
the expression of it doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Its activity is more or less determined by
the presence of these interactors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been shown that constants
expression in rice doesn't change very
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Arabidopsis, constants expression
during the flowering period tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: During long days, constants increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It increases the expression of FT and
leads to this gradual development of
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are 13 different constants gene
in the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we identified the ones that were most
highly expressed in our wife cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we studied the ones that were most
highly expressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that the majority of the
constants genes were actually
[SPEAKER_02]: downregulated upon the entry into short
days, which, given that it is generally
[SPEAKER_02]: acting as an activator of flowering,
this doesn't line up It's a little
[SPEAKER_02]: strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the genes, constants number nine,
did not change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were able to find that only one of
the constants genes, constants number
[SPEAKER_02]: five, seemed to be significantly
responsive to phytochrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's also interesting because
constants number five is the QTL that was
[SPEAKER_02]: given to us by Austin Shepp at Rapid
Genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more than likely, we're going to
continue looking at constants number five
[SPEAKER_02]: as the potential activator here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so now we're getting to the
transcriptome that I mentioned previously,
[SPEAKER_02]: the bioinformatic aspect of this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took our leaf samples at pre-short
days or day zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we took our leaf samples from the same
plants at day seven of short days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, obviously,
the critical day length is completely
[SPEAKER_02]: flipped from those two sample types.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took the total RNA from these leaf
samples, and we sequenced the mRNAs,
[SPEAKER_02]: which results in what's called a
transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we took the transcriptome and
performed a differential expression
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the goal of this is, simply enough,
to see which genes were up or
[SPEAKER_02]: downregulated by the entry into short
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this is going to do is give us a
list of CDL-gated genes, which are
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially involved in the transition
into flowering and may also be interacting
[SPEAKER_02]: with constants to perform this function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thankfully, I was able to find a really
brilliant bioinformatician to help me out
[SPEAKER_02]: with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Nathan Johnson from Verne
Bioanalytics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very grateful for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were able to produce a differential
expression analysis, which gave us a very
[SPEAKER_02]: long list of genes both down and
upregulated upon the entry into short
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what this is giving us is our list
of CDL-gated genes, which we can continue
[SPEAKER_02]: to study to look for other interactors
with constants, which are sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: mediating this transition into short days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would also like to mention that we
mapped and annotated these transcriptomes
[SPEAKER_02]: against nine different reference genomes
and got coverage ranging from 10 to 70
[SPEAKER_02]: percent, where the Jamaican lion genome
was easily by far the highest mapping and
[SPEAKER_02]: annotation at 70 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were really grateful for that
complete genome to use as a reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving forward where it's headed,
we would like to actually take PRR37 and
[SPEAKER_02]: demonstrate that it does direct directly
interact with constants to activate FT,
[SPEAKER_02]: as the model would suggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would also, of course, like to
start studying these other CDL-gated
[SPEAKER_02]: genes, which are homologous to rice genes,
which may also be interacting with
[SPEAKER_02]: constants to have some sort of effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And additionally, any gene that's
modulated by critical day length may also
[SPEAKER_02]: have some sort of function that it's
performing in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeast two hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, we need to dig into
the genes that are at the auto flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: alleles, not the least of which including
these micro RNA species, which I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: discuss very much, but are more than
likely critically important in this
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, also SPLs, which is this
whole host of less studied genes in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, which activate SOC1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where it's headed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is my talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to give a big thanks to Dr.
Gerald Berkowitz for his continued
[SPEAKER_02]: support, as always, especially to Dr.
Nathan Johnson from VernBio, who was so
[SPEAKER_02]: gracious to help with the bioinformatic
work, and definitely Austin Schep from
[SPEAKER_02]: Rapid Genomics, who provided us with the
list of QTLs we use for our QPCR analysis
[SPEAKER_02]: to begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any evidence that nutrition
could affect the transition to flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen several nitrate responsive
genes, SPLs, and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any data showing that
nutrition could delay or accelerate the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could delay or accelerate what,
exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: The transition to the flowering process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The transition to the flowering process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrition, we don't have any data
specifically on the effects of nutrition
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting gene expression or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do suspect that, obviously,
having optimum plant health is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: optimize this transition into flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't have any data specifically on
how nutrition would affect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a quick question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how could this information help smaller
co-op farmers and growers that are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to get into this industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very big dominated, but also with
the science and bringing it in and giving
[SPEAKER_01]: their plants that really good chance of
producing excellent quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think this would be critical for
that, actually, because one of the major
[SPEAKER_02]: barriers to growing cannabis is investment
in the facilities that it requires.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're able to grow plants outdoors
successfully, that would obviously be the
[SPEAKER_02]: least expensive way to get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many growers in northern latitudes in
particular are limited as to what they can
[SPEAKER_02]: grow outdoors because the plant has to
finish or else they won't be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest it in time to actually collect a
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's critically important for people,
for breeders in particular, to develop
[SPEAKER_02]: fast flowering individuals for the success
of farmers generally, but in particular,
[SPEAKER_02]: those who want to be cultivating outdoors,
which is probably the preferred way in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of environmental sustainability,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to be growing underneath
lights like that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having a fast flowering individual
definitely supports small farmers and
[SPEAKER_02]: organic farmers in particular and being
able to grow in the field at northern
[SPEAKER_02]: latitudes in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
