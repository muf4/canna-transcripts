[SPEAKER_00]: Canapedia is one of the largest public
databases for cannabis and hemogenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to being a genomics resource
to the public community, Canapedia is also
[SPEAKER_00]: where medicinal genomics customers will
get access to genetic reports for samples
[SPEAKER_00]: that they submit for either sequencing or
genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: To date, there are over 1,200 registered
strains in Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we'll walk you through the
redesigned Canapedia website and highlight
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the key features.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitting the registered strain link at the
top will bring up a list of all publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: registered strains in Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strains are presented in a session date
descending order.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can toggle the order by clicking on
the arrow next to the sort by category.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can change the sort by category to
either grower or name by clicking on the
[SPEAKER_00]: sort by category, and you can also toggle
the sort order of the other categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right-hand side are search
parameters that can be used to further
[SPEAKER_00]: refine the results viewed on the left-hand
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, click the add parameter
button, scroll down to THC 8%,
[SPEAKER_00]: enter a value of 15, and then click the
update results button.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you'll get in the return search is
every sample in our database for which a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype for THC 8% has been submitted
and which is greater than or equal to 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also toggle the directionality of
the sort order with the arrows that are to
[SPEAKER_00]: the right of the sort by THC 8% parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parameters can also be stacked on top of
each other to further refine the search.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if we want to search the
database for anything with a THC 8% of
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than or equal to 15%, but also a
CBD 8% of less than or equal to five,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just add that as an additional
parameter and update the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that the results of what is populated
on the left-hand side has changed to
[SPEAKER_00]: reflect these two parameters combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we'll add one additional parameter
to further refine the search so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have any strain name that contains the
word lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll update the results and the two
results that are found are the two
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican lion samples that are in
Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is for CanSymp90 and one is for whole
genome sequencing and we'll look at those
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little more depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start by taking a closer look at the
whole genome sequencing report for
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name of strain is on top along with a
unique identifier session in our Canapedia
[SPEAKER_00]: database, some information about the
submitter, sample name, accession date,
[SPEAKER_00]: reported plant sex, and the sequencing or
genotyping technology that was used to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate the genetic report.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've introduced a lot more search
functionality into Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several fields in a Canapedia report now
have an embedded hyperlink.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hover over these, you'll notice to
the right of the term a search icon
[SPEAKER_00]: appears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clicking on any of these links will do a
database-wide search matching that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular term.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, clicking on the medicinal
genomics link will give us all samples
[SPEAKER_00]: where medicinal genomics is the submitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas clicking on the gender female link
will give us all samples in the database
[SPEAKER_00]: where the plant sex was reported as being
female by the submitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rarity plot shows how common your
sample is compared to all other samples
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been submitted to Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: A top-heavy plot indicates that a sample
is rare, whereas a bottom-heavy plot
[SPEAKER_00]: indicates that a sample is more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next section of the Canapedia
report, chemical information for the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain is presented where this information
is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: This information is collected from the
submitter at the time of sample
[SPEAKER_00]: submission.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetic information section of the
report reports this plant as being a type
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 plant, meaning that both the THC and CVD
synthase genes are intact in the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: lion genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the right of this are several files
available for download that represent the
[SPEAKER_00]: results of the whole genome sequencing
that was performed on the sample to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate this Canapedia report.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VCF, or variant call format file,
contains genotypes for the 800 million
[SPEAKER_00]: plus positions in the Jamaican lion
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The annotated VCF file contains only
genotypes which differ from the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: lion reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The annotated VCF file also contains
annotations showing which genes overlap
[SPEAKER_00]: the variants, as well as any details
pertaining to any protein coding changes
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: FASTQ files contain the raw sequencing
reads which come out of the DNA sequencer,
[SPEAKER_00]: while the BAM files contain the mapped
positions of those reads to the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: lion reference, and what was used to
generate the variant calls which are used
[SPEAKER_00]: in the analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plot on the left shows the
heterozygosity distribution for all
[SPEAKER_00]: samples in Canapedia, and the line shows
where the current sample we're viewing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the report falls on this distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this sample is a Jamaican lion
clone, it's expected to be more closely
[SPEAKER_00]: related to the Jamaican lion reference,
and therefore has a lower heterozygosity
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage that falls to the left of this
distribution curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sample that's more distantly related to
Jamaican lion will fall to the right of
[SPEAKER_00]: this distribution curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders can use this heterozygosity
information as a proxy for assessing seed
[SPEAKER_00]: line stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: A more stable seed line will have a lower
heterozygosity percentage and will fall to
[SPEAKER_00]: the left of this distribution curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right-hand side is the Y ratio
distribution plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists at Medicinal Genomics were able
to determine which regions of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genome belong to chromosome Y by
sequencing the Jamaican lion father,
[SPEAKER_00]: by taking the total number of reads that
map to Y, and then dividing that by the
[SPEAKER_00]: total number of reads that don't map to Y,
you're able to calculate the Y ratio and
[SPEAKER_00]: take a distribution of this over all
samples in Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plot shows Y ratio scores for two
separate distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In red is a population of known female
plants, and in green is a population of
[SPEAKER_00]: known male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The line shows where this sample falls in
relation to these two separate
[SPEAKER_00]: distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: A line that overlaps the female
distribution is more likely to be female,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a line that overlaps the male
distribution further to the right would be
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely to be male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next section of a Canapedia report has
next-generation sequencing coverage over
[SPEAKER_00]: key cannabinoid genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patterns of deletions in these genes
indicate the type of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In type 1 plants, active CBD synthase is
deleted, and there's no next-generation
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing coverage over the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: In type 2 plants, active CBD synthase and
active THC synthase are both intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in type 3 plants, active CBD synthase
has coverage over the region, showing that
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene is intact, but active THC
synthase has no coverage over the region,
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting that it's deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a fourth type, type 4,
in which there is neither coverage over
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD synthase or active THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inactive CBD synthase is in close
proximity to the active THC synthase gene
[SPEAKER_00]: is being tracked because of its proximity
to give a sense of the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabichromine is another gene we track
in Canapedia which may or may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: One interesting feature of cannabichromine
is that it may be responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesizing THC in cases where the THC
synthase gene is deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a good time to point out the
key differences between a CANSTMP90 and
[SPEAKER_00]: next-generation sequencing-based canapedia
report.
[SPEAKER_00]: A CANSTMP90-derived canapedia report has
much of the same content as a
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing-based report.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key differences are in the genetic
information section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that only the annotated VCF files are
available for download, as the other file
[SPEAKER_00]: formats are specific to sequencing
technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deletions in key cannabinoid genes are
also presented, and a plant type is called
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the patterns of these deletions.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the nature of the data
necessitates that the information is
[SPEAKER_00]: presented and analyzed in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each genotype called in CANSTMP90 chip has
a logR ratio score associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A deletion can be detected using these
logR ratio scores across multiple variants
[SPEAKER_00]: in a particular region.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average logR ratio scores were
calculated for samples detected as having
[SPEAKER_00]: these deletions and samples detected as
not having them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sample with a high correlation to the
average of the deleted samples likely has
[SPEAKER_00]: a deletion in this region, and a sample
with a low correlation likely has that
[SPEAKER_00]: region intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that for CANSTMP90, we also have
several Y chromosome markers on the chip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sex of the plant is determined using
this same process, since a female sample
[SPEAKER_00]: represents what a male sample would look
like with the Y chromosome deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath the deletion plots is a table
that has the summary of deletions showing
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual correlation scores for this
sample to the population that has the
[SPEAKER_00]: deletion, and it has the actual cause
whether the deletion is intact or deleted,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for the plant sex whether the sex of
the plant is male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath the deletion summary are two
tables showing a summary of variants
[SPEAKER_00]: detected in the sample, showing point
mutations that are predicted to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate or high impact on protein
functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the first table, we've got THC,
CBD, and CBC synthase variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath that is a list of variants for
40 genes that are curated by scientists at
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal genomics thought to play an
important role in cannabis genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these would be important genes in
cannabis and mutations that might affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the functionality of these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variants table can be sorted on a
particular column using the arrows to the
[SPEAKER_00]: right of the column header name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, there's a search box in the
top right-hand corner of the table that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used to search any text contained
within the table and filter the results
[SPEAKER_00]: based on that search.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if we're looking for any
variants that fall on CONTIC-700 of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican lion reference, we simply type
CONTIC-700 into the search box and we only
[SPEAKER_00]: see variants on CONTIC-700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, if we want to see only variants
which have a TC allele, we could put T
[SPEAKER_00]: slash C into the search box to display
only those.
[SPEAKER_00]: A description of the gene can be displayed
by hovering over the gene abbreviation in
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene column.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a UniPro link, which links
out to UniPro, where there's more detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: information describing this particular
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next section of the Canapedia
report, we're showing you the genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: closest samples to your sample compared to
everything else in our database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do this by taking a list of
high-quality variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 4,000 variants or so that
are filtered with the high QC values,
[SPEAKER_00]: high sequencing depth of coverage across
the reads, and ones that are found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: population with a certain minor allele
frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take those variants and calculate a
distance between the sample in Canapedia
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything else in the database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we rank these distances to show
you which are the most similar and which
[SPEAKER_00]: are the least similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the left-hand side, we're
actually showing you the nearest relative
[SPEAKER_00]: to Jamaican lion, which is the sample that
we're looking at in this Canapedia report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's based on every publicly available
sample in Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're viewing on the
left-hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also see any private samples,
which also you are the owner of if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: elected to have private Canapedia reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the right-hand side, it's a little
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's showing what we call the base tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the base tree is a set of strains that
we have in our database that, for the
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose of calculating distances,
we always keep the same base tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea was just that as Canapedia
continues to grow and some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: samples that are in the database will
continue to grow as well, we'll always
[SPEAKER_00]: have that stable base tree that can be
used and referred back to and can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: to compare samples to one another and have
that kind of stable comparison set that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can use as the kind of Canapedia grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now beneath this, we have the opposite
collection of tables, which is showing you
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the most genetically distant
strain from Jamaican lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, what are the most
genetically distant ones from the base
[SPEAKER_00]: tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have these plots that show the
sample of interest, as well as kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you a graphical representation of
what are the most similar and what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: most distant samples to your sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this final section down here,
we have the nearest relative genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: relative in the Filos data set on the
left-hand side and the nearest genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: relative in the Lynch data set on the
right-hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are two data sets that we
downloaded from NCBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's publicly available data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just some additional databases
that we've added for comparison purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can look at, for these public data
sets, which sample is calculated as being
[SPEAKER_00]: the closest to your sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you click on the link, you'll
actually be taken to NCBI to that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular record for that particular
sample set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get additional information
about the sample by exploring these links
[SPEAKER_00]: on NCBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at the very bottom, we have blockchain
registration information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing is we're taking the
genetic data, the VCF file specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: we take that and we calculate an MD5 sum
for it, which is a unique identifier for a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular contents of a particular file.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take that unique identifier,
which is called a hash, a SHA-SUM hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: and encode it in a blockchain transaction,
which is what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the blockchain transaction ID is
something that is submitted to the
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on it and it's a
decentralized database that medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics does not have control over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will store your hash sum in the
blockchain in a decentralized database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can do is if you ever need to
prove to someone that you had a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: strain with a particular set of genotypes
at a particular point in time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can refer to them to this blockchain
transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to get that particular
hash sum is using that exact file.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was generated as part of the
canapedia analysis that's in the canapedia
[SPEAKER_00]: report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone could download that file.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could do their own hash sum of the
file, and then they could reference the
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain to prove that you had that
strain at a particular point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the details of this
blockchain transaction presented in this
[SPEAKER_00]: PDF file, which could be printed out and
given to someone, presented to them via
[SPEAKER_00]: email, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a nice way to kind of summarize
the whole transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concludes the walkthrough of our
canapedia redesign.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, don't hesitate
to reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our contact information is on the screen,
and we'd be happy to help answer any
[SPEAKER_00]: questions you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
