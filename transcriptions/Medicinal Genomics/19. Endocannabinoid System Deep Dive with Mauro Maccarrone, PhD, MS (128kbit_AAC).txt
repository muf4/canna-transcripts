[SPEAKER_02]: In other news, we've started a Facebook
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each year, we are consistently blown away
by the amazing presentations, inspiring
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations, and important connections
that are made at the annual CanMed
[SPEAKER_02]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided to keep the conversations
flowing online with our CanMed Community
[SPEAKER_02]: Group.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CanMed Community is our virtual forum
allowing you to interact directly with
[SPEAKER_02]: many of the CanMed Conference speakers,
past attendees, and other groups and group
[SPEAKER_02]: members to discuss all things cannabis
from bench to the bedside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the link in the show description to
visit that group today and join.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our guest this episode is Dr. Mauro
Macaron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mauro is a pioneer in endocannabinoid
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1997, his team identified the receptor
targets for the first two endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: that were discovered by Professor Rafael
Machulam earlier in the decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since then, the endocannabinoid system has
been the focus of his research.
[SPEAKER_02]: At CanMed 2021, Mauro will present the
complex endocannabinoid system and the
[SPEAKER_02]: challenge of developing selective drugs
towards its distinct elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Macaron's understanding of the
endocannabinoid system is exceptional,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I really enjoyed picking his brain on
some of the topics that have come up in
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations with others.
[SPEAKER_02]: We discuss the technical challenges that
prevented researchers from understanding
[SPEAKER_02]: the endocannabinoid system until the early
90s, how the discovery of the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system changed medical
research and drug development,
[SPEAKER_02]: the difference between endocannabinoids
and phytocannabinoids, the large number of
[SPEAKER_02]: enzymes involved in synthesizing and
cleaving each endocannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how blocking or enhancing those
enzymes can affect the concentration of
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids in a person's body,
how endocannabinoids work together to
[SPEAKER_02]: create an entourage effect, how an
increased level of endocannabinoids can
[SPEAKER_02]: help you forget a painful experience like
childbirth or a difficult run,
[SPEAKER_02]: and why researchers need to agree on a
standardized formulation of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: to use for research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to that conversation,
I'd like to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Science and Technology and their
newest brand, Cannabis Patient Care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Science and Technology focuses on
educating the legal cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: about the science and technology of
analytical testing, quality control and
[SPEAKER_02]: assurance, extraction, cultivation,
and processing slash manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In October, Cannabis Science and
Technology launched a new brand,
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Patient Care, which is an
educational research for patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and
caregivers on the latest research,
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits, and treatment options cannabis
provides for a variety of illnesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to CannabisScienceTech.com to learn
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wouldn't be the CanMed Coffee Talk
podcast without some good coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that, we always turn to the hemp
and coffee exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know, hemp coffee is a
healthy, delicious, natural product,
[SPEAKER_02]: rich in trace minerals and nutrients,

[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Dr. Mauro Macaron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Mauro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for inviting me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're very excited to have you as a
presenter at CanMed 2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really interested to see what you have
to present on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for people who maybe aren't familiar
with you or familiar with your work,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping we could start if you would
give sort of a brief bio of who you are
[SPEAKER_02]: and the research that you've done into the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm a biochemist and I work as a
full professor at University of Rome and
[SPEAKER_00]: recently moved to University of L'Aquila
that is nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was involved for almost three decades in
lipid signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how certain fatty molecules can bring
information in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was there when endocannabinoids were
discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, I made of that a major
subject of my research activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my group works actively on the
endogenous components that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were actually there when the
endocannabinoid system was first
[SPEAKER_02]: discovered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we issued our first paper in
1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that the first
endocannabinoid, anandamide, was
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered by Raphael Mishulam's group in
1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second major endocannabinoid,
2-arachidonylglycerol, was discovered in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, by Mishulam and independently
Sugura.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two years after the discovery of these
compounds, we were able to show some
[SPEAKER_00]: properties of their receptor targets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I know we're going to get pretty
deep into the endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_02]: all the different body systems and organs
that it touches, but maybe it'd be good to
[SPEAKER_02]: start for, again, people who may be aren't
as familiar, if you could kind of give a
[SPEAKER_02]: broad, broad brush summary of what is the
endocannabinoid system and what function
[SPEAKER_02]: does it serve in the body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, this is a system because
it is composed of many molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are able to activate targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are called agonists of receptors
and are the true endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endocannabinoids come from fatty acids
that we eat and we know for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: like arachidonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have all the targets of these
endocannabinoids, again, receptors on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of our cells, enzymes,
little machines that break down or
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesize the endocannabinoids,
other proteins on the membranes that can
[SPEAKER_00]: transport endocannabinoids in and out the
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, it is quite an ensemble of
molecules, we should say, basically
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed everywhere in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them virtually in all tissues
where they play different roles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So given that the endocannabinoid system
seems to be so ubiquitous, as you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned, it's pretty much present in
almost all the body tissues and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: body organs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think it took so long for
researchers to really discover the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system and the role that
it plays in the body?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really good question,
Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, lipids and
endocannabinoids, again, are lipids,
[SPEAKER_00]: are fatty molecules, are quite difficult
to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And research on these molecules is never
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not yet possible to buy something
from a company that all at once allows you
[SPEAKER_00]: to measure the amount of these components
and to understand if they are present and
[SPEAKER_00]: if they are what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is maybe a purely technical question
or scientific problem, if you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: that lipids are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is difficult to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was then after many years of
research on proteins and then on nucleic
[SPEAKER_00]: acids, the information material of our
cells, that we were able to look more
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully into lipidic substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, in the 80s for arachidonic
acid derivatives, and then in the 90s for
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids, research focused on
these molecules and was able to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of quantum leap since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, since the discovery of this
system, and as we mentioned, it is
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in so many different organs and
tissues, how has that knowledge sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: changed how medical research is done into
different disorders that may affect these
[SPEAKER_02]: systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is true that the discovery of
endocannabinoids immediately attracted
[SPEAKER_00]: also pharmaceutical companies because the
endocannabinoids themselves and the
[SPEAKER_00]: targets that they hit in the cells can
represent novel targets for novel
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutics in a time where we did not
have so many new, totally innovative
[SPEAKER_00]: targets to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, in a few years, basically one
and a half decade, we could say,
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that break down endocannabinoids
became targets for intense research
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts by all major pharmaceutical
companies all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so were the receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, these compounds had filled a
gap and they in this gap, therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives seem to be very, very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I was doing the research for this
conversation, I did come across your paper
[SPEAKER_02]: entitled Endocannabinoid Signaling at the
Periphery 50 Years After THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite extensive look at the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I've mentioned several times,
all the different organs and body systems
[SPEAKER_02]: that it interacts with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will put a link to that paper in the
show notes in the description so everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: can take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I very much encourage people to read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of heavy hitters in the
co-authors of that paper, including our
[SPEAKER_02]: dear friend here at CanMed, Dr. Raphdyal
Machulam, I was hoping we could kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: use maybe that paper as a framework to
explore the endocannabinoid system a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe let's start with covering some of
the different systems that the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system interacts with and
that really show that promise for
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutics that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, thanks for the quotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to say that that was a
community paper that I happened to put
[SPEAKER_00]: together and coordinate with colleagues
that have contributed the most to the
[SPEAKER_00]: field since the discovery of THC,
Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives me the chance to make a
clear point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant extracts, so the phytocannabinoids
like THC, were discovered approximately 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years before the endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to clearly make a distinction
between the endogenous compounds that all
[SPEAKER_00]: of us, we do have, and those compounds
that some of us decide to take in
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways by the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabinoids were discovered now more
than 50 years ago in 64, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: by Raphael Machulam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only after that, we understood that
there are endogenous compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: activate the targets, accidentally
activated also by the plant extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore cannabinoids are something
different from the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoids in the
endocannabinoid system certainly holds a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of promise for the central nervous
system where it can control, can
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some indications whereby
depression can take advantage of an
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibition of the cleavage of the
endogenous cannabinoids, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also at the periphery, bone
homeostasis rather than reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: functions, rather than energy homeostasis,
which means food intake, the pleasure of
[SPEAKER_00]: eating food, the search for palatable
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we take energy out of food,
making more fats like lipogenesis or
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking fats in the lipolysis,
all these aspects are in a way or another
[SPEAKER_00]: under control of the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's interesting when you're sort of
making that distinction between the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids and the
phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, at least I understand that
folks who benefit from cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: therapies typically may have a deficiency
in their endocannabinoids that the body is
[SPEAKER_02]: creating endogenously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what I understand in talking with
you that the endocannabinoid system is a
[SPEAKER_02]: very complex system with a lot of
different things at play.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many different ways could someone
develop a deficiency in their endogenous
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there are actually many, which makes
the field complex, but also challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: and promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a general guideline,
each endocannabinoid is biosynthesized by
[SPEAKER_00]: one or more enzymes, and then it is
cleaved by one or more additional enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to block or enhance any of
these enzymes, you can modify the final
[SPEAKER_00]: content of endocannabinoids, what is
called in general, the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our body, apparently, the way we
use, we take advantage of endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: as very special signals, is through
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a metabolic control.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the way our body decides
how much endocannabinoid must be in a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain cell at a certain point can make a
really difference between health and
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned that there are a lot of
different endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roughly, how many different
endocannabinoids do we know of,
[SPEAKER_02]: and are there more?
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, we can say that we know a dozen,
of which still the very first two to be
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered, anandamide and 2-AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that I mentioned before were found
already in 1992 and 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two remain the most interesting
because apparently, they are the main
[SPEAKER_00]: signals that our cells use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet we have to admit that of the quite
many others, we don't know yet much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we have not learned enough about
anandamide and 2-AG that we decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate thoroughly the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, we cannot really predict if
another of these endocannabinoids can be
[SPEAKER_00]: more relevant for a certain specific
condition, maybe a specific disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the topics that always comes up in
talking about cannabis medicine is this
[SPEAKER_02]: whole idea of the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm curious to get your thoughts on
that from an endocannabinoid perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were just talking about there are
many different endocannabinoids so is
[SPEAKER_02]: there sort of an entourage effect that's
happening endogenously as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a very interesting question,
Ben, because we have learned, and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: clear, that there are compounds that do
not act directly on the receptor targets
[SPEAKER_00]: of the endocannabinoids, but can
potentiate the activity of other
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids on those receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they interact and interfere with
the metabolism of those endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, by blocking the hydrolytic
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this entourage effect seems to be
relevant under many, many circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, also the endogenous compounds,
not to mention the plant extracts that we
[SPEAKER_00]: might ingest for whatever reason,
also the endogenous compounds can play
[SPEAKER_00]: this entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned earlier when we were
talking about how it took so long for
[SPEAKER_02]: researchers to really fully understand the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that it's hard to test
someone for the levels of endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: that are in their system, or at least it
was earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a better system for doing that
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can someone go and get tested and get lab
results in terms of figuring out if they
[SPEAKER_02]: have an endocannabinoid deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the techniques remain sort of
highly specialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to use what is called liquid
chromatography mass spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it is true that now you can find
these techniques much easier than it was
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you need a high level of
specialization and high level of expertise
[SPEAKER_00]: to do these assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not like for other substances in our
blood that with a drop of blood in 20
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, you have your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still quite challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are investigations looking for
alternatives and this might change the
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario in the coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, you still need a high level of
specialization and quite sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery to do these assays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would imagine too, would the level
of endocannabinoids in a person's system
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of depend on different stresses or as
you said, you know, it can be part of
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do the levels sort of fluctuate
throughout the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: This cannot be really said conclusively
from a scientific point of view because to
[SPEAKER_00]: my knowledge, it has never been tested in
a very solid scientific manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we know is that there are changes
during the day rather than during
[SPEAKER_00]: different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, the estrus cycle in women.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly there are changes from
individual to individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interpersonal changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot yet assign a certain meaning to
a certain value.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not at the stage of defining
threshold values below which everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: okay for the whole population and above
which there might be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, let's say, starting to learn how
these differences could be meaningful for
[SPEAKER_00]: our health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I personally, I'm a runner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am familiar that as I believe and you
can certainly correct me if I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_02]: that anandamide is sort of what's credited
with the runner's high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it depends on the way you,
what you mean with high.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can tell you is that there could be
an increase in anandamide, but maybe to
[SPEAKER_00]: cope with the pain that can be associated
with an extensive physical exercise
[SPEAKER_00]: because endocannabinoids like anandamide
are certainly analgesic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is the hypothesis that when you
practice a lot, but also in other
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances, like in the delivery phase,
when you are delivering a baby,
[SPEAKER_00]: an increase of endocannabinoids help you
to cope with pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also something extra and
something more that seems very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that an increase level of
endocannabinoids might help you to forget
[SPEAKER_00]: aversive memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to forget something that you did not
really like, but that in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution must be done again.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, once again in a parturition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pain that the mother can feel in
the delivery is forgotten better with an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase of anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that you feel better as if you
were smoking a joke, but you might feel
[SPEAKER_00]: less pain and forget something which is
negative due to this increased level of
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're telling me that my body is
helping me forget the pain from that run
[SPEAKER_02]: so that I'll get up and do it all over
again the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you like to do it again and you don't
associate the negative memory or the pain
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling that you had.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is certainly a clever trick because I
do get out there and do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did want to talk to you a bit more about
cannabis therapeutics or maybe just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, phyto cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the newer aspects that we've
been seeing research on at CanMed is
[SPEAKER_02]: looking into sort of these different types
of cannabinoids, whether it be in acid
[SPEAKER_02]: form or even in cannabinoid varins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if you could speak a
bit to sort of how these different forms
[SPEAKER_02]: of the cannabinoids, how does their effect
differ on the body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as for the acids, you know that we
also have endocannabinoids that are
[SPEAKER_00]: acidic, like N-arachidonylglycine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a natural substance, an endogenous
substance with an acid tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is an endocannabinoid acid,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that it mimics some of the
properties of anandamide, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: with affinity for type 1 cannabinoid
receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: with an anti-inflammatory activity,
and again, analgesic properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same can be said for the main
cannabinoid acid that is a phyto
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid this time, a derivative of THC
and 11-oic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides the chemical chemistry behind,
is an acid form of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one is a form of excretion,
is a metabolite that has to be wasted by
[SPEAKER_00]: the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you add acidic tails to endogenous
or plant-derived cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: you certainly have different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe what is more complex is to
understand how these molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with the barins, like, for instance,
the THCV, the tetrahydrocannabibarin,
[SPEAKER_00]: they play together with the other
components of plant extracts or the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this complexity of molecules working
together is a real challenge to be
[SPEAKER_00]: understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having THC, having CBD, cannabidiol,
having both together or having them along
[SPEAKER_00]: with other less investigated compounds can
make really a huge difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: biological activity that they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got to be the biggest challenge of
all, is that there seems to be so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different compounds at play here and it
seems to be very individualistic,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, in terms of what the need is in the
individual body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine that must be a very big
challenge for anyone who's trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: develop a therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what I like to say as much
as I can is that it is a pity that we did
[SPEAKER_00]: not yet decide which are the standardized
formulations to be tested also in
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we keep on using different
formulations of which maybe you only know
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of THC and CBD, but you do not
really, I don't want to seem unpolite,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't seem to care at all about
the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually miss the opportunity of
learning from what you are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because using different things will not
give you a solid knowledge that will
[SPEAKER_00]: finally help you to advance your
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to clearly say that cannabis is
not one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have as many cannabis as many
formulations are going around,
[SPEAKER_00]: are being used or can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the composition of it each formulation
and also the amount of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: components of each formulation can make
really a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should now decide how to
standardize these things with the hope of
[SPEAKER_00]: learning maybe from mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a five year time, 10 year time,
we will really know better what is good,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is less good for our health.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a really interesting point and it
really touches on a lot of the different
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations I have had on the podcast
and presentations that we have had in
[SPEAKER_02]: previous CanMeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, from a testing perspective,
it is difficult for them to have assays
[SPEAKER_02]: that are going to detect all the different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not even gotten into terpenes and
flavonoids and stilbonoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am interested to get your thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from a testing perspective,
it is hard for them to really get a full
[SPEAKER_02]: profile of what the product is.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a cultivation side, it is very hard
for them to produce a consistent product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it is interesting to hear you say
from a research perspective that it is
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult for you to have a real standard
medicine to work off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems to be a problem that really
touches all the different aspects of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a problem that finally has to be
faced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm perfectly aware that it is not a
trivial problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you consider that we know that from a
cannabis extract from Cannabis Sativa or
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Indica, both used to make
formulations used in therapy, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: expect at least 110 different phyto
cannabinoids and on top of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least 440 non cannabinoid components
like terpenoids, flavonoids and so many
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a challenge, but it is just
because this challenge can lead to real
[SPEAKER_00]: good drugs, therapeutic drugs that we have
to take it in the proper way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: To reach in an easy way, a good drug at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to study properly the composition
and the effects of these combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe if we did that 20 years ago,
now we would really know so much more than
[SPEAKER_00]: we could have more therapeutics that are
active, effective and are based on these
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it certainly would have been nice to
get a Trump start 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know at least here in the United
States that that was not possible given
[SPEAKER_02]: the laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: But thankfully, those seem to be loosening
and research has really come a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're excited in a lot of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I may add, Ben, another clear
distinction that we should make is between
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis and medicinal
cannabis, because a therapeutic use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis under the responsibility and the
control of a physician that continuously
[SPEAKER_00]: looks after his patient is something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to my understanding, that could be
made as free as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, a recreational use of
cannabis can be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not at all true that these compounds
are harmless, especially if you think of
[SPEAKER_00]: what is going on is available also through
Internet and other means to young people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really find formulations where THC
itself is 10 times more concentrated than
[SPEAKER_00]: in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other formulations where you also have
unexpected compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a free recreational cannabis can be
more dangerous than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly I have the feeling that
certainly these mixing up the two
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational and the therapeutic did not
help the medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I think you're right,
at least for a long time here in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, it is still the case today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been classified as a schedule one
drug, which which states that there is no
[SPEAKER_02]: known therapeutic use, which I think we've
pretty much disproven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly your work and the work of
many others have done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully and sooner than later,
we can remove that tag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I let you go, because I know
I'm coming up on the end of the time that
[SPEAKER_02]: I promised to keep you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did want to talk a bit more about
turpinoids, flavonoids, stilonoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sort of these these compounds that are
present on the plant that aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So therefore, they're not really
interacting as endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I wouldn't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but are they sort of mimicking other
endogenous compounds within the body to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of help those cannabinoids do what
they need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, for for some of them,
there are activities known for decades
[SPEAKER_00]: like anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some might also have specific targets
that are certainly different from the
[SPEAKER_00]: targets of the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the concept of the entourage
effect could come out here in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that the combination of these compounds,
non-phytocannabinoid compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: together with some phytocannabinoids that
are present in a formulation can change
[SPEAKER_00]: the reaction of the endogenous system to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do not know much about these
interactions and these interferences among
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, this is why we must
standardize formulations and investigate
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects in a systematic, very sound
manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people might find it maybe
discouraging to hear how little we still
[SPEAKER_02]: know or how much work we still have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I find it fascinating and exciting
that there's still so much more to know
[SPEAKER_02]: and so much more potential within this
plant and within this system as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess with that, that's a good place
to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I want to thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I let you go, I want to give
you an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a website that you'd like to
point people to or if I don't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're involved on social media or
anything like that, any sort of plug you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to give to the work that you're doing
so people who are interested can learn
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be great to share that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I suggest people to look through
PubMed, which is an official site open,
[SPEAKER_00]: public, where scientific studies are
reported rather than uncontrolled or less
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific, not to say gossip that you can
find easily elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, when you want to know more,
try to have a good source of information
[SPEAKER_00]: where it is clear that things that are
claimed are claimed because there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific background well recognized by
the scientific community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, you can go to PubMed,
an NIH site, and under my name,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might find the papers and whatever you
want to know more, I'd be glad to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact and exchange information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is excellent advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things beyond cannabis, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always make sure that you're trusting your
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Mauro, thanks again for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to seeing you out in
Pasadena for CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Ben, for the
