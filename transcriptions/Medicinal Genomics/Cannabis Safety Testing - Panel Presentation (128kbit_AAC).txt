[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, welcome to the Cannabis Safety Testing
Panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: My day job is Director of Clinical
Research at Tilray, but I also serve as a
[SPEAKER_04]: member of the Cannabis Advisory Committee
to the state of California, advising them
[SPEAKER_04]: on their regulations in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this issue of product quality safety
is really maybe not very interesting to a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of you, but it's actually critical to
elevating this industry, and it's a very
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult topic to cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have with me here four chemistry
experts, and they're going to help us kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of discuss this topic and tease apart some
of the most important issues that we need
[SPEAKER_04]: to be thinking about, and I'll let them
introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my name is Kyle Passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm representing MedMed Enterprises LLC.
[SPEAKER_05]: We own, manage, and operate a slew of
licenses for the cannabis industry across
[SPEAKER_05]: the nation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I serve as their Laboratory Director for
compliance, specifically ISO 17025 for our
[SPEAKER_05]: in-house analytical testing facilities
that are built within our facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: My background is in biochemistry and
laboratory diagnostic assay development,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I am coming here by lieu of Doug
Kennedy to speak to compliance and
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations for analytical laboratories in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Kyle Boyer, and I'm a field
application scientist with medicinal
[SPEAKER_06]: genomics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I received my bachelor's degree in
neuroscience and behavior from the
[SPEAKER_06]: University of California Santa Cruz,
and I currently serve as the vice chair
[SPEAKER_06]: for the American Chemical Society's
cannabis chemistry subdivision as well as
[SPEAKER_06]: their scholarship chair.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my background is mostly in cannabis
testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been doing it for about six years
now, and I got my start at one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: first independent analytical laboratories
in the state of California, and in those
[SPEAKER_06]: six years I've tested about 100,000
samples of medical cannabis at this point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Andrew Pham.
[SPEAKER_08]: I currently serve as the scientific
director at Bell Coastal Labs,
[SPEAKER_08]: the first licensed and accredited lab in
Long Beach, California.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am also the chair of the cannabis
chemistry subdivision at the American
[SPEAKER_08]: Chemical Society as well as a
court-qualified expert witness testifying
[SPEAKER_08]: in over two dozen cases involving
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm Mike Flournoy, president of
Eurofins, Frontier Global Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in this analytical world since
1989.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel pretty old.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been really grateful in going
through all of the cannabis documentation
[SPEAKER_01]: and with all of the sciences going on with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm here to hopefully help navigate
through some of the quality pieces,
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is a really infant type of
industry, and there's a lot of information
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be learned from the past that we
were hoping to put together with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so I'm going to set the stage a little
bit by telling you what I currently see as
[SPEAKER_04]: a cannabis in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_04]: So full disclosure, I have a son with very
severe treatment-resistant epilepsy and
[SPEAKER_04]: have been looking for products that are
safe to give him for the last six years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even today, if I walk into a dispensary,
I'm not comfortable with the product
[SPEAKER_04]: quality standards of any product that I
find in a dispensary, at least not in
[SPEAKER_04]: where I live in northern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I don't know whether the product
will be contaminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know whether the potency is
correct, whether the labeling for THC and
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD content is accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is a real problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a very educated consumer because
of my background.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're at a place where a lot
of consumers are not as educated and
[SPEAKER_04]: really don't understand that nobody is
overseeing these cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_04]: being sold in dispensaries because right
now it's the industry itself that is kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of paving the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that I wanted to
talk about with you guys today is how do
[SPEAKER_04]: we ensure that the testing industry,
you know, with lack of federal oversight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the speaker from medicinal
genomics gave a good overview of how the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations differ state by state and how
the states apply different standards or
[SPEAKER_04]: different they reference different
pharmacopias to establish their
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if there's going to be no federal
oversight, how can we as an industry raise
[SPEAKER_04]: the bar in testing to make sure that a
sample that is being given to two
[SPEAKER_04]: different labs in let's just say in
California would return the exact same
[SPEAKER_04]: results.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's the goal that we're going
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so let's start with Kyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of your suggestions for,
you know, for the testing industry itself
[SPEAKER_04]: to raise the bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you guys are all for part of
different organizations and maybe you can
[SPEAKER_04]: speak a little bit to what the different
organizations do and which one might be
[SPEAKER_04]: the best suited to set, you know,
third party standards for all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: testing labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for my case example, we're not an
independent laboratory testing facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have laboratories within our
vertically aligned facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that being said, we have to take
into account local jurisdictions across
[SPEAKER_05]: many different states.
[SPEAKER_05]: From my background in both pharma and
biotech and even in clinical, we follow
[SPEAKER_05]: strict regulations, specifically ISO,
International Standard Organizations,
[SPEAKER_05]: and even more so specifically ISO 1725.
[SPEAKER_05]: With my experience going from state to
state and dealing with local jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_05]: is that a lot of the authorities there,
for example, fire marshals, if not county
[SPEAKER_05]: authorities, rely on people like us,
people in the industry to educate them on
[SPEAKER_05]: how to build a regulatory system,
how to apply that on us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in terms of moving the compliance and
regulation forward to make sure that it is
[SPEAKER_05]: moving towards a federal legalization
amendment, we impose local jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_05]: and local standardization and also ISO as
a prerequisite for a lot of our facilities
[SPEAKER_05]: and a lot of building analytical labs and
also developing more methods.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also speaks to teaching a new
generation, especially with this new
[SPEAKER_05]: version of ISO 1725, which takes out a lot
of the details from 2005 and leaves a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of things generalized.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in a sense, this opens a door for
innovation to allow more creativity that
[SPEAKER_05]: still follows compliance and regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, it gives an
opportunity for perhaps legacy growers or
[SPEAKER_05]: people who have been growing things for 20
years in their garage who say that they
[SPEAKER_05]: can honestly grow this with a certain
distance or whatnot, but unable to teach
[SPEAKER_05]: them to use objective evidence,
like using an analytical lab to actually
[SPEAKER_05]: track and monitor chemicals and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's important to use regulations and
compliance to not only help this industry
[SPEAKER_05]: move forward, but to also help the people
within the industry to be more familiar
[SPEAKER_05]: with the progression of regulation and
compliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to ask Michael a question
because you come to this with background
[SPEAKER_04]: from other industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: So environmental testing, food testing,
what are some of the, so given your
[SPEAKER_04]: extensive background in these industries,
which are well regulated, what can we take
[SPEAKER_04]: from each of those, you know, regulatory
standards and apply to this industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you raise a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And technically, this particular chemical,
this particular plant, this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: food, it could be, transcends a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it is a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why should you put it in food?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really not something that
it's like a tobacco, but it is because you
[SPEAKER_01]: can smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes across many different markets,
many different fields that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really puts it into a different category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't really look at it as a drug,
but FDA is there, DEA is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do look at it as a drug,
but we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEA really puts a class map down even
on the DOT, so being able to move things
[SPEAKER_01]: across really makes it very, very
challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, you know, kind of looking back at
the past, working with the EPA and the
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA, back when they were developing
methods back in the 60s, 70s, 80s,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was kind of like the Wild West,
kind of like it is today, specifically on
[SPEAKER_01]: the analytical side, on the testing side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I recall, you know,
we were able to do one-point calibrations
[SPEAKER_01]: back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to hold the calibration for
as long as we wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all of those changed because it
was a very big need for getting accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so using some of the lessons learned
from those industries from the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can certainly use that information
today to make this particular process much
[SPEAKER_01]: faster to the endpoint as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being able to, you know, kind of
distill everything that we've done,
[SPEAKER_01]: it all comes down to validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it all comes down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're able to get a good validation
protocol with the intention of having good
[SPEAKER_01]: limits, because that's also part of it,
that will definitely get you to a point
[SPEAKER_01]: where it starts defining what type of
instrumentation you'll need, what type of
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry analysis you'll need,
what type of processes you'll need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to make things move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also gives you an opportunity to be
able to let technology help you grow
[SPEAKER_01]: faster, help you get better over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you start to constrain
everything because you've made it too
[SPEAKER_01]: constrained through your methodology,
then it's really hard to help technology
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's kind of the gist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically striking a balance between
allowing innovation to occur in a very
[SPEAKER_04]: nascent industry, but still superimposing
some of the standards that are common in
[SPEAKER_04]: other industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one example for the audience is common
reference standards don't exist,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So a reference standard is by definition
the same thing every time any lab uses it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And currently in California, there is no
reference standard for any of the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids, which means that you can't
call it a reference standard, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And Andrew, a question for you might be,
what has your experience been serving
[SPEAKER_04]: customers in?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the issues that have come
up because of the lack of a common
[SPEAKER_04]: reference standard?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's the same complaint that pretty
much every one of our clients is saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a distributor.
[SPEAKER_08]: We take a same sample to 10 different
labs, and we're getting 10 different
[SPEAKER_08]: results.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are so many technical
difficulties to overcome in order to fix
[SPEAKER_08]: this.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, an actual common reference
standard would be extremely helpful in
[SPEAKER_08]: really getting everyone on the same page.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, in my opinion, if this can't be
done on the federal level, I think the
[SPEAKER_08]: burden is actually on the state.
[SPEAKER_08]: States have established reference testing
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if the state has a reference testing
lab, they can act as the referee.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can present your validation data to
them, and then you can actually compare
[SPEAKER_08]: your data to other labs who anonymously.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really think that's really the best
path forward because the state reference
[SPEAKER_08]: testing labs won't really be motivated by
churning out results in order to make
[SPEAKER_08]: money.
[SPEAKER_08]: The resources are going to be from tax
revenues.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they'll actually have resources.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll have equipment in order to really
get these methods together down and be
[SPEAKER_08]: able to share these with the testing labs
that are doing this commercially.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So another problem we see is that people
use different equipment to test products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the equipment has to be calibrated a
certain way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be cleaned a certain way.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all called standard operating
procedures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'll give this question to Kyle
Boyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: What has your experience been when you see
the different types of equipment being
[SPEAKER_04]: used in different labs?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do labs have standard operating
procedures in place that are relevant to
[SPEAKER_04]: the types of equipment that they use?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how can we standardize that process a
bit more?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it come from an external regulatory
body?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it come from the manufacturer of the
equipment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you speak a little bit to that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think really what it is is we all
need to agree on what is the appropriate
[SPEAKER_06]: instrumentation to quantify or detect a
given analyte or I guess in the case of
[SPEAKER_06]: microbiology, pathogens or species of
interest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really what it comes down to is the
states need to all come together and
[SPEAKER_06]: establish some sort of consensus as far
as, OK, here's what we need to be looking
[SPEAKER_06]: for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then here is the appropriate
methodology to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: A good example of this that I see is
Canada's microbiology.
[SPEAKER_06]: My colleague Yvonne spoke to this quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a kind of scattered mismatch
between the states.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some states are doing total count tests.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are doing species-specific
pathogen tests.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are using plating.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are using quantitative PCR.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all these systems, they vary in their
results and their methods.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think really what it is is it's hard
to establish any type of consensus when
[SPEAKER_06]: there's so many people doing so many
different things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think it needs to come from all
these labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really need to come together and
collaborate and speak with each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all these states, they also need to
collaborate and speak with each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you feel is the most important in
terms of patient safety and what levels
[SPEAKER_06]: are appropriate?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will then dictate what
methodology is used and what type of
[SPEAKER_06]: instrumentation is used.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as of right now, I don't think that
there is that consensus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, we're all scattered doing our
own thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think California is doing a good job
of paving the way for establishing some
[SPEAKER_06]: consensus because they've really done a
lot of diligence in figuring out what is
[SPEAKER_06]: important for patient safety.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that we just all need to have
this conversation in order to arrive at
[SPEAKER_06]: what is the appropriate methodology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we've talked a lot about the
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's going to take years to
address.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's focus a little bit on the
solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have mentioned different societies
that you belong to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which would be the third party that could
take on establishing
[SPEAKER_04]: SOPs or common testing methods in the
cannabis industry that are specific to the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry and address some of the
issues that we see that may not be seen in
[SPEAKER_04]: food or pharma or environmental arenas.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of science going on,
a lot of research going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: AOC is working really diligently on
developing methods that could do a
[SPEAKER_01]: majority or a large amount of the testing
for different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being able to validate every product
is almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are certainly ways you can group
things into categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the AOAC and some of these other
organizations can push that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Michael.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the AOAC?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Association of... It used to
stand for Association of Antilocal
[SPEAKER_08]: Chemists.
[SPEAKER_08]: But recently, they just changed it to
AOAC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now it just stands for AOAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But looking at just the methodology,
they're putting together a set of
[SPEAKER_01]: criteria, a set of quality criteria to be
able to do the process of digesting or
[SPEAKER_01]: extracting and analyzing samples for
results, to be able to mitigate
[SPEAKER_01]: interferences and be able to mitigate the
processes so that you're getting better
[SPEAKER_01]: quality data and not having huge biases
one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, there's lots of different
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, this is actually gonna
transcend just one market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, we're looking at it as more
of a food drug type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's gonna get environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna get into the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna have to test it in the
environmental space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to start looking at exactly
what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that'll go into more EPA style
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be in the permits and all this
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of looking at it from a standpoint
of what do we need to do as an
[SPEAKER_01]: organization?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we as a community, we have to really
engage with some of the organizations that
[SPEAKER_01]: you may belong to so that we can try to
come together on some of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other advocacy organizations that
are out there, ACIL, the Association of
[SPEAKER_01]: Independent Labor Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm on the board, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck?
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, looking at some of these
other organizations that are out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: we should all come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be able to help the government be able
to put together something that we can all
[SPEAKER_01]: live with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go back to the past, that was when
the EPA developed the methods that the
[SPEAKER_01]: labs were supposed to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it didn't work later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They developed these methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the labs were supposed to use
those methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it still happens that some of these
companies that are doing the testing are
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty darn smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're able to do a lot of these
developments on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of looking at how we can put all
of these together, we all need to come
[SPEAKER_01]: together as a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to kind of demand on what we think
is going to be best for the consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the reason why we're all here at
the testing level is to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're making our communities safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the EPA, it's community safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA, community safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even DOT, community safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at every level, this is all about
safety for consumption, safety for the
[SPEAKER_01]: community, safety for our children.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we all need to come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put together something that's going to
work for this particular product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you brought up something important,
which is this comes in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_04]: forms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a gummy bear could come to the lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: A brownie.
[SPEAKER_04]: A candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And dissolving all of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then being able to run a test that's
accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And coming up for a method for all of
these different ingredients is going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I see the end result, what the ideal
would be.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we're going to tackle it one step
at a time, what are the most important
[SPEAKER_04]: things to test for right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we heard that certain forms of
aspergillus are much more harmful than
[SPEAKER_04]: others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And currently, very few people are testing
for those.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the first step in looking at
safety?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be the very first step and the
minimum standards?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can go from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think when it comes to, at least with
microbiology, you definitely hit it with
[SPEAKER_06]: aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is like, it's an endophyte in
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's commonly found.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one of the actual pathogens that
can kill people.
[SPEAKER_06]: That it's documented, well documented,
it can kill people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it comes to pesticides,
I think we need to understand,
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, what is commonly being used?
[SPEAKER_06]: And at what levels is it actually OK to
have them in?
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, things like Michael butanil
are constantly being used.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's, of course, some research
that's been done to show that it produces
[SPEAKER_06]: cyanide when it's combusted.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's clearly an unsafe product for
any type of smokeable product.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what is being commonly used?
[SPEAKER_06]: And establish these limits based on
science.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what's currently happening right
now is no one's really basing these
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations on scientific research.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just taking their best education
to make a dedicated guess as to what is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to keep people safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that also puts people in the testing
labs in a really tough position.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you set the bar extremely,
or your detection limits, extremely low,
[SPEAKER_06]: and what's allowable at extremely low
levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: It becomes very difficult to actually
comply with these regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because again, it's not based on science.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's based on what they feel is
keeping people safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really think that a lot more research
needs to go into what is an acceptable
[SPEAKER_06]: level of certain contaminants in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there's also heavy metals as
well that need to be tested for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, that's something that we
should be absolutely testing for all
[SPEAKER_06]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think no levels of heavy metals are
very low levels or going to be tolerated.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we need to establish consensus as far
as what is OK and what is not OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as far as mycotoxins go,
that's another contaminant that at the
[SPEAKER_06]: moment, I just don't think we have enough
data to support how rigorously this
[SPEAKER_06]: mycotoxin testing needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we see that there is
aspergillus there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But are the conditions sufficient enough
to produce these types of mycotoxins that
[SPEAKER_06]: could be deleterious to human health?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that there's a lot more research
that needs to be done in order to
[SPEAKER_06]: establish what these limits should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now, we're just taking our best
educated guess at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think we need to see more data in
order to actually establish proper limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way back in the 60s, 70s, 80s,
they did lots of studies that determined
[SPEAKER_01]: what type of chemicals, specifically in
the environment, we're going to be harmful
[SPEAKER_01]: at what levels, which is how they develop
these permanent levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we do need to do that for these
because at the contaminant level,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have to speciate something to be
able to determine which one is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have some forms of good arsenic?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some forms of bad arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad arsenic is really, really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good arsenic, you can take quite a
bit of it, and you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as these limits are progressing,
you have to be able to determine what is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be important to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just heard today from a friend I just
met that North Carolina is using an
[SPEAKER_01]: instrument that is not very capable of
being able to determine which is the bad
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of a chemical that it's trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And THC's not really that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're kind of looking at how much of
it is going to be the right amount is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to really determine what type of
instrumentation you're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: need to do that particular analysis or the
species of that chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there needs to be some studies
on what it is that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: calling important and understanding that
that's going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because over time, you're going to have
different technology that's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being able to determine what is going
to be important to the consumer is super
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the levels that I've seen just in
California, to me, those are high numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: based off of the type of testing that we
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, for arsenic is 0.1 and for
0.1 ppm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for mercury, mercury is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some mercury that is not
horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But methylmercury is super bad for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have 0.05 micrograms or
milligrams of ppm of methylmercury,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not really good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not good at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to come together with what
these type of limits need to be based off
[SPEAKER_01]: of the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because it's called arsenic
doesn't mean that's part of the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's many, many forms of
arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the important part.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just throw this out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't think either of you
answered my question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is, what do we start with?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know that a lot of research needs to
be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we need to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do we start with right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: I really think it starts with
toxicological studies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically making sure and studying exactly
how much, to me, it's pesticides is the
[SPEAKER_08]: largest public health danger.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's really important right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we don't have a great idea on how
much is dangerous to human health in terms
[SPEAKER_08]: of inhalation routes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, a lot of these pesticides have
been used in food for decades.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we don't really know how dangerous it
is when you put it to a flame and inhale
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's really what's important
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to bring up heavy metal
testing is obviously going to be important
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that a lot of these vape carts are
being filled with oil, the carts
[SPEAKER_08]: themselves are being produced from China.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which doesn't really have a lot of heavy
metal testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So contamination levels that we're seeing
in vape carts, I mean, there's just not a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of data right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's an extremely big risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's interesting that you bring up
vape cartridges.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're putting substances in the
vape cartridges like PEG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't know what the long term risks
are of inhaling PEG.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not a good chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's nobody overseeing that
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is really scary to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a separate issue though.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we were to put in place certain
standards right now, I mean, clearly we
[SPEAKER_04]: need to know accurate potency,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we want to avoid overdosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as contaminants, what would be...
So the 0.1 parts per million for arsenic,
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael, I think that's in the AHP.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the USP, and it's okay with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now I'm hearing you say that that's
too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty high to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based off of some of the food studies that
we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get into... Prop 65, I want to
bring that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prop 65.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get into serving size,
people are eating grams and mini-grams of
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It adds up pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you need to see lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, that's actually pretty scary to
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's the standard that almost
everyone everywhere follows the 0.1 parts
[SPEAKER_04]: per million for arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look down to 0.001.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our MDL.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in Canada, we can't use pesticides
because the government can't regulate the
[SPEAKER_04]: pesticides, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't decided what's an acceptable
pesticide to use on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we use none.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, the EPA has not really put out a
list for which pesticides are okay to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at what levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: So does that mean we should not be using
pesticides at all?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some naturally derived
pesticides that have definitely been
[SPEAKER_08]: readily widespread and available.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think even California put out a list of
acceptable pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they not?
[SPEAKER_04]: California did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're leading the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have something to contribute to your
previous question of where should we
[SPEAKER_05]: start?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it follows back to Mike's
answers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should just all start with validation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Proper, full validation because there
aren't any standard methods available to
[SPEAKER_05]: use and to be accredited for in the
nation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have to develop our own methods
in-house and get those validated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a third party body to oversee that
would be going for accreditation.
[SPEAKER_05]: To get accreditation, to get an
international standard accreditation,
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to go through an accredited body.
[SPEAKER_05]: That accredited body is a part of a bigger
national body that oversees competency,
[SPEAKER_05]: that oversees accuracy, precision of labs,
of testing labs, including cannabis labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if we start with a robust
validation program for any of our methods,
[SPEAKER_05]: pesticides, heavy metals, even potency,
and then a part of that validation is also
[SPEAKER_05]: a robust proficiency test.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that speaks back to your certified
reference materials, the need for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then that would get the ball rolling with
all of us at least measuring the same
[SPEAKER_05]: thing the same way altogether.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're talking about proficiency
testing, which the state could even
[SPEAKER_04]: oversee theoretically because you're
allowed to develop your own methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to show that you get the
same result every time you use your
[SPEAKER_04]: methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the common... So how many of you
have a schedule one DEA license?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you need one in order to get the...
There are commercially available reference
[SPEAKER_04]: standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And are you using those?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see anyone using those?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they require a schedule one DEA
license?
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are actually commercially
available reference standards that you
[SPEAKER_08]: don't need a DEA license with as long as
it's in a concentration of a thousand
[SPEAKER_08]: milligrams per mil or less.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what most of the testing
laboratories are using right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Emerald Scientific has also started
putting out reference standards that are
[SPEAKER_08]: in a hemp bud matrix.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically if it has less than 0.3% THC,
it's not technically unlawful to ship
[SPEAKER_08]: across state lines, although it's a really
big gray area.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that's a really good step
forward because proficiency tests in the
[SPEAKER_08]: past have basically only just been these
vials of reference standards at certain
[SPEAKER_08]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that point, you're really just
testing at where your machine is.
[SPEAKER_08]: All you have to do is dilute it and put it
in.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it doesn't evaluate your sample
preparation method at all, which is
[SPEAKER_08]: probably more than half of the reason that
there are so many disparate results among
[SPEAKER_08]: labs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only that, sample collection is a
really big deal.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not collecting the sample in a
statistically valid and representative
[SPEAKER_08]: manner, then you're not gonna get the same
result.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have about 10 minutes left and I
think I'll open it up to questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Diane Strauss and I'm a member
of the Hemp Roundtable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with
the Hemp Roundtable or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Hemp Roundtable has put forth a
great amount of resources to produce a
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp certification program that has been
created by Where Food Comes From.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where Food Comes From is an agency that
developed the USDA agranic standards and
[SPEAKER_02]: has developed many other standards and
certification programs for a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: food industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is going to be validated by
VALIDIS.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are going to be the third party audit
on this program for hemp producers,
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, and processors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be unveiled at HIA in Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The HIA show starts, I think, on November
2nd or 3rd of this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be held in Los Angeles this
month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does address a lot of the things
that we're talking, that you guys have
[SPEAKER_02]: been bringing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the hemp industry, we felt that it
was imperative that the industry itself
[SPEAKER_02]: started setting standards so that people
could have confidence and safety in the
[SPEAKER_02]: testing and in the processings of which,
in a way, things are being produced and
[SPEAKER_02]: being offered to the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: So soon you will be able to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not quite up yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's going to be an ongoing and
improving certification program and will
[SPEAKER_02]: be available January 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was your name again?
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Diane Strauss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be, I think it's going to be,
it's ushempauthority.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ushempauthority.org will be the URL that
will be, or you could also go to the US
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp growing table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there'll be a link.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully those standards can also be
used in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning the THC industry as well,
even though this is specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: certifying to show that it is less than .3
and it has the GMP standards that are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be needed from grower all the way
from seed to processing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You sure?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is David Shurer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I own a specialty chemical company dealing
with chromatography.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we work with, you know, you want to
know about the process and the best way to
[SPEAKER_07]: deal with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the stationary phase people
that make sample prep products that you
[SPEAKER_07]: need to work with, those who make SBE
cartridges, those who make the analytical
[SPEAKER_07]: instruments such as Shimadzu and working
with them to define the best methods for
[SPEAKER_07]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're currently in an alpha stage with
that and currently going to a beta stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd love to speak with any of you to
talk about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now you've made a good point.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got the highest quality of
analytical testing equipment and
[SPEAKER_07]: consumables for you guys to do the best
work.
[SPEAKER_07]: The challenge is how to successfully use
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you brought out a great point about
sample prep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, right now we're sending samples to
different labs, the same sample getting
[SPEAKER_07]: different results.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you have that just as something
for pesticides besides concentration of
[SPEAKER_07]: THC, CBD and other compounds within that,
it is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I go to the people that make
chromatography products.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're one of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can help you in defining those
methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, I just want to bring that up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is a process that we're making
for you to understand for total
[SPEAKER_07]: decontamination of pesticides from the
extracts while maintaining the integrity
[SPEAKER_07]: of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to talk with you guys after.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys, for mentioning method
validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important in the
interim until we get some actual standards
[SPEAKER_00]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a question about if you see any
usefulness in round-robin testing as a way
[SPEAKER_00]: to compare labs either within a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's difficult to do that across
states at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But could you just comment on the role you
might see or not see for round-robin
[SPEAKER_00]: testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Round-robins are a great exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really shows deltas between different
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going back to his result and his
response on getting good sample prep,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the pesticides, or even something as
simple as metals, if you have an oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to get it into an aqueous form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being able to do that is not very
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I do think there is something
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably have to have someone who's
run round-robin before to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trick is that you have to somehow do
something similar across state lines and
[SPEAKER_01]: then be able to bring all data together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're OK with just having a state
round-robin, you have to kind of make that
[SPEAKER_01]: decision if you're OK with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, I think it's great to be able
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good thing about the hemp thing,
though, if we're able to ship across state
[SPEAKER_01]: lines because we've been doing it,
but the good thing about hemp is that 0.3%
[SPEAKER_01]: is a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of instrumentation, instruments
can see so much lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can make tons of standards at 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is something to that,
to be able to do a round-robin even at
[SPEAKER_01]: that level, to be able to show,
even on a difficult matrix, that
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratories can see similar results or
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, based off of that information,
be able to know exactly where you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: target for improvement.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's also a technical
difficulty in doing a round-robin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that, basically, having a single
reference material that's fully
[SPEAKER_08]: homogenized and can actually be shipped
across state lines, it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, how do I find a butane hash oil
sample with exact same amount of butane,
[SPEAKER_08]: and how can I ship that to other labs to
test among my results?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's definitely going to be helpful,
but it's definitely challenging right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the round-robin testing,
or ring test, as I'm used to calling them,
[SPEAKER_06]: is definitely a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that we're seeing, at least
within certain states, I know that
[SPEAKER_06]: recently there was a publication out in
the journal Nature that took a look at all
[SPEAKER_06]: the Washington state labs and took a look
at the potency results.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you saw quite a bit of variance
between the labs, and you could always
[SPEAKER_06]: pinpoint where a certain result came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that comes down to,
well, how is the sample being prepped?
[SPEAKER_06]: How is the instrument being calibrated?
[SPEAKER_06]: What instrumentation are you using?
[SPEAKER_06]: And being able to see the distribution of
how people report their results is
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely very important, and I think
that should be implemented.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just a sample of Washington state
cannabis testing laboratories,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think something like that should be
implemented across, nationally,
[SPEAKER_06]: to take a look at how are states
performing between each other and who's
[SPEAKER_06]: reporting the more accurate result.
[SPEAKER_05]: As an internal auditor, I would say yes to
a round-robin.
[SPEAKER_05]: The standard for ISO says for in-house
develop methods, you either have to
[SPEAKER_05]: partake in proficiency tests testing or
inter-lab, intra-lab proficiency testing,
[SPEAKER_05]: where appropriate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So going for accreditation, you really
have to plan this out if you're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: round-robins, especially with your
accrediting officer, for them to
[SPEAKER_05]: understand that this industry does have a
lack of resources, like reference
[SPEAKER_05]: materials.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are strapped with our hands around our
back when it comes to shipping samples,
[SPEAKER_05]: even within state.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it has to be very robust,
and for proper validation, do not skip out
[SPEAKER_05]: on proficiency testing, no matter how you
can do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so my question is more, well,
it's more of a suggestion, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talked about MIPS and how they come in
all different forms, whether they be
[SPEAKER_03]: gummies, candies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, basically now they're putting it
into anything they can find.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not test the starting product,
whether it be the oil or what have you,
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes into the MIPS instead of the
final product?
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you don't have to develop all
these different methods for all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different matrices.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were to test what's going into it
at the start, and then know if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: contaminated, is it free of pesticides or
microbials?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one way we could do it,
and then you would have to have a two-part
[SPEAKER_04]: testing set up, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could test the oil for
contaminants, but then in the final
[SPEAKER_04]: product, you still have to go back to
testing for potency.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and then you don't actually know if
the other ingredients that they're putting
[SPEAKER_08]: in it is also safety tested.
[SPEAKER_08]: So either way, you'd probably have to test
it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there could be pesticides in the
non-cannabis ingredients they use,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is something we've seen a lot in
other products.
[SPEAKER_05]: As somebody who works for a company with
our vertically integrated labs,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's important to test from conception of
a product all the way to the end result,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially when you're getting materials
from vendors, questionable vendors,
[SPEAKER_05]: China and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important to test them in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go through such a rigorous process of
getting to your gummy bears or whatnot,
[SPEAKER_05]: which does require heat and require a lot
of manipulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's advantageous to monitor your whole
process through manufacturing and
[SPEAKER_05]: production using objective evidence by
testing at every step to see if there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: part here you need to troubleshoot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the step, especially
depending upon which state, state
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations require you to also provide
information on the final product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's important to not only do beginning
and end, but advantageous to do throughout
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
