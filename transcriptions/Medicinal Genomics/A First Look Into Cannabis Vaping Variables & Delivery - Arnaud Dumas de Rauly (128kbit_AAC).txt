[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for sticking around
until the last presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say I feel super humbled to be
up here speaking because everyone in this
[SPEAKER_00]: room is probably way smarter than I am and
I just want to thank everyone that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been talking to over the past couple of
days and thank you CADMED for making this
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of controversies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to dive deep into a lot of
detail of what's doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to give an overview because we
still need to do a lot of research when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to specifically focus on
emissions and rheology.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people talk about viscosity when
it comes to vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, viscosity is only a little piece of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of vaporization is a mix
between chemistry, fluid mechanics,
[SPEAKER_00]: thermodynamics, and not just putting oil
in a tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the key things here to understand
as a consumer, when you buy a product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not buying just the oil or just the
hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be a symbiotic relationship
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the safest, cleanest oil in a
bad hardware and the consumer will still
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bad experience and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial goal of this was really R&D
and understanding how we can better
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver the cannabinoids, terpenes,
all of the different components that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: continually discovering every day for
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we kind of made the scope a lot bigger
as we're pulling back these onion layers
[SPEAKER_00]: of research and what's going on with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the variables that affect
aerosolization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone says vaping, but it's not really
vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's aerosols through the use of,
for instance, a 510 thread cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we measure the influence?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is emissions testing and
rheology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emissions testing is testing really the
vapor that comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the regulation right now test the
oil that goes into these devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is there's a state change
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What comes out of it is not at all what
goes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, why do you do emissions
testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumer safety, transparency,
quality control, future regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very easy to understand that
once we enter federal legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA is gonna come in and they are going to
regulate the hell out of this and ask us
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened with the nicotine vaping
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened with food supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna happen with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's very important that as an
industry we're prepared with data,
[SPEAKER_00]: with information to explain to these
regulators exactly how things work and
[SPEAKER_00]: start working today for future regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at emissions, one of the
components is a puffing regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a regular tobacco puffing regime is 55
milliliters inhaled during a puff for
[SPEAKER_00]: three seconds every 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is consumed in a total different
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a couple of puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily like a cigarette
where you have to have the 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote unquote, 12 puffs for one cigarette
all at once because it's consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis vaping, you can literally have it
in your pocket and if some of you have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen me, I've been vaping for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can vape completely differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want more info, I think the
decks are gonna be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link here that shows our 2021
survey of vaping topography where we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually come up with a vaping regime
specific to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that regime, that's the basis for
all of the emissions testing because
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions are different depending on the
regime, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking into emissions, what's the
link with rheology?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different moduli on
storage, loss, doing a temperature sweep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna show you some highlights after
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, how do we measure
all of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with the ACM, the aerosol collected
mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaking, clogging of a cartridge are
really a function of all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And controlling those parameters allows to
bring a better experience, better aerosol
[SPEAKER_00]: collected mass or better deliverability
for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on the left side, you see a
rheological report.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a temperature sweep where we're
basically testing the product in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge from 20 to 70 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left side, you have the consistent
storage modulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the blue line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the most important here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red line is viscosity, very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same in both graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it goes down with more
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green line is the loss modulus where
we do see a consistent loss of energy in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pascal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what's expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the focus is the blue one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the storage modulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much energy in Pascal does the
concentrate and the cannabis inside your
[SPEAKER_00]: vaping device store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it has to be something fairly
consistent for the deliverability to be
[SPEAKER_00]: here and for bioavailability to work with
your patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you don't see on the right
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the elasticity of the oil
that's in your cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the variables and what they mean
when we're looking at emissions testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just spoke about aerosol collected
mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also measure this, of course,
with DWL divide weight loss to correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: with ACM and understand exactly what was
vaporized and how rheology affects the
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pressure drop, that's basically the result
of resistance to airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're simulating a puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The delivered cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna show you a little slide at
the end where we can really pinpoint how
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids are delivered throughout
the life cycle of a device or a cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's scary sometimes because some of
the cannabinoids actually disappear when
[SPEAKER_00]: you get towards the end of the cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking, for instance,
for CBN, at the end of the cartridge,
[SPEAKER_00]: after using it for a couple of days,
there's no more CBN in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very, very important to understand
how each of these cannabinoids is
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you'll see, and you can see this
really everywhere in tobacco, is the
[SPEAKER_00]: aldehyde exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why would we look at the aldehyde
exposure?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the dry hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, when your coil and the medium,
the wicking material that contains and
[SPEAKER_00]: aerosolizes the extract, is burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we can measure if there's a
dry hit or if the wicking material has all
[SPEAKER_00]: the right properties to encapsulate and
deliver that aerosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, very easily, if you wanna simulate,
for instance, a dry hit on any cartridge,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a couple of puffs in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll quickly see that the last puffs
don't taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you measure that on a vaping
machine, you're gonna see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered cannabinoids are completely
different off the charts, not to mention
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential degradants, which I'm not
even covering here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, heavy metal exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of talk about heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the immediate go-to is, it's the
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, 80% of the heavy metal
results for cannabis and vaping products
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, what is responsible for heavy
metals in emissions is variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very often due to the hardware
and the concentrate that you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: into these devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you a very simple example,
you look at distillate, roughly a pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: four.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more terpenes you add, the more pH
goes down, the more acid it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the more leaching can happen with the
materials that are in your device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is basically the three potential
results once you go through all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a restrictive attribution,
which really shows that there's potential
[SPEAKER_00]: aldehydes, flavor, poor performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really, again, the genesis of
starting all of this research is to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that we're delivering product in the
correct way to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at something that's
oversized, that means potentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: intake holes are too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wicking material is not absorbing
enough of the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads to clogging, which then turns
into leaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we hit the symbiotic
relationship between the hardware and the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate is a proper feed and matched
rheology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you wanna adapt and do rheology
testing with every single concentrate out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it's practically impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in certain cases, when you're looking
at very specific applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is definitely needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, not many people are
willing to do this in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're an ancillary company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We manufacture hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get asked by my investors,
why are we doing this research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why aren't the processors doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can anonymize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take our clients' oils and test it
without knowing which is which.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the processors are afraid
of the liability of potentially finding
[SPEAKER_00]: something that they're not gonna like and
ending up with a master settlement
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement in 20 years like tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, little nugget of information
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I was alluding to in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three different types of hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see when they're filled at 100%,
at 50%, at 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We track all cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also track terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put the main two here, CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in certain cases,
when the product is, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% full, you see these numbers change
drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're providing these products
to patients who don't know anything about
[SPEAKER_00]: the science, who don't know anything about
cannabis, it's very, very important that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are made aware that at the end of the
cartridge, you're not gonna have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the beginning of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's decreased efficiency over
time with this hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that no one's ever
gonna be looking into because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially admitting that the hardware
doesn't match the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it happens today in 95% of the
products that are on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
