[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Kevin McKernan for
inviting me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the former UIUX tech lead of Dash
Core Group Incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I currently advise multiple blockchain
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever downloaded a Shutterfly
photobook, I am listed as a patent
[SPEAKER_00]: inventor on that particular project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was involved in the FedEx print online
application that allowed you to upload
[SPEAKER_00]: documents to FedEx.
[SPEAKER_00]: And picked them up at a FedEx office
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what I'm saying is I'm a
developer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been focusing on front-end
development for most of my life as a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discovered this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I share this is because I want
to let you know that I've been involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the software industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cryptocurrency, I believe,
is the next evolution in software.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love to see the cryptocurrency
industry in places like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit out of place.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit kind of why is this guy here
kind of feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love being that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to introduce you and invite you
into the next evolution in economy that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that events like CanMed and
sponsorships and things that the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics is doing on the data Dash
blockchain are just a sample of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in the future economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the fractalization of niches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blockchain is going to touch every
single aspect of our society in some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't understood this yet,
and you've just heard about this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: called Bitcoin, or you're wondering what
Dash is doing here, let me explain to you
[SPEAKER_00]: what I think is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the information that we have been
giving to organizations like the
[SPEAKER_00]: government, Facebook, Google, all of these
things that invade our privacy in ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't really understand at a very
basic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ways that they invade our lives and
collect the data on where you had
[SPEAKER_00]: breakfast this morning, what hotel you
stayed at, what your credit score is,
[SPEAKER_00]: your bank account balance, how much money
you make, who you work for, who your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends are, what your friends buy,
what you buy, what you buy for your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this information is being collected on
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dash believes, and the Dash ecosystem
believes as an ethos that privacy is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a lot of people think that Dash
is a privacy coin, which it kind of is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It offers privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always opt-in privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's just one of the things that
Dash is doing, and what you get with that
[SPEAKER_00]: privacy is the ability to treat a digital
token, a scarce digital token,
[SPEAKER_00]: as cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as good as cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can exchange it at places like
cannabis stores, and nobody has to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's what you're spending your
money on, because you can opt-in to a
[SPEAKER_00]: private option.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why Dash is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dash, the Dash masternode network,
as an organization, and I should say at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point, it is a legal, legal and
legally recognized association.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dash Association of Masternode Owners
is listed as the beneficiaries on a New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand trust that is administered by a
Swiss organization that has the Swiss
[SPEAKER_00]: administrator that is legally bound to
protect the interests of the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficiaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the Dash Masternode Owners,
Association of Masternode Owners,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an association of random people,
anonymous people throughout the world who
[SPEAKER_00]: own Dash masternodes, and I'll tell you
what that is if you're not aware in just a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Association of Masternode Owners is
the beneficiary of this trust,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Swiss administrator is bound to
work on behalf of that beneficiary with
[SPEAKER_00]: regard to the assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the assets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, two, Dash Core Group
Incorporated and Dash Ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which hasn't quite listed yet,
but Dash Core Group Incorporated is a
[SPEAKER_00]: Delaware corporation that currently
employs about 70 people, roughly about
[SPEAKER_00]: half of whom are developers charged with
the duty of improving and sustaining the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dash masternode network.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dash masternode network is a protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a copy of Bitcoin with
improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works just like Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know how Bitcoin mining works,
you put a node on the network,
[SPEAKER_00]: you mine on the network, you spin hash
cycles, and you can earn tokens on the
[SPEAKER_00]: network if you add to the ledger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add the next block to the ledger,
that's the blockchain, the chain of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the transactions that happen on the
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: This network is public, open source,
and censorship resistant, meaning you can
[SPEAKER_00]: send money to anyone in the world and
nobody can stop you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This basically makes you your own bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It removes central banking from the
equation of issuing money and managing
[SPEAKER_00]: money, but it does put you in the position
of having to take responsibility for all
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that banks and governments do
in terms of issuing and transmitting money
[SPEAKER_00]: to people around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice thing about this is we get a
little bit of our power back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are empowered to control our financial
futures by managing our funds in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that nobody can stop us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can tell you that you cannot
transact with this person, and nobody can
[SPEAKER_00]: stop your account from functioning at any
time as long as this public open source
[SPEAKER_00]: platform continues to exist, which it has
for about three years just on the Dash
[SPEAKER_00]: masternode network.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bitcoin network has been going about
10 years now, and the reason that I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe so very strongly that
cryptocurrency is going to in fact disrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: every single industry on this planet is
because we've already seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been privileged to see three
instances of such disruption in my short
[SPEAKER_00]: lifetime of 42 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time happened when I was nine
years old with the PC revolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: when my dad would not buy me a strobe
light, and in my nine-year-old angst,
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned to code basic and turned that
IBM PC Junior into a strobe light.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very pleased to have done that,
and I realized as a nine-year-old child
[SPEAKER_00]: that that was going to change the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empowering a nine-year-old to turn a
computer into a strobe light means that
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody in the world with a computer can
do a lot of very powerful things,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of very powerful calculations,
a lot of interesting things, both in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of graphics and, as we've seen here,
science and academics and education
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time it happened, I was running a
BBS, a bulletin board system, when the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet came about, and I told my parents
that they needed to invest in FedEx and
[SPEAKER_00]: UPS because every box store in the world
is going to disappear, and everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be shipped around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how else are you going to get your
products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now I'm seeing that soon enough
we'll be able to fabricate them off the
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain, and they'll just have corner
locations where you just fabricate
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to fabricate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I think is going to be
enabled by these blockchain systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This exchange of value that has come in
this quarter century of this information
[SPEAKER_00]: age, as we're currently labeling it,
is now going to include not only
[SPEAKER_00]: information and media and connections and
social aspects of our society,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now we have an exit strategy from the
centralized banking and government
[SPEAKER_00]: controls over value.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to have borders on our
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to ask for permission to
exchange value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, soon enough, we won't need to ask for
permission to trade many, many billions
[SPEAKER_00]: and millions of dollars worth of value,
and perhaps even the dollar won't be the
[SPEAKER_00]: denominating factor of the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think is going to happen,
and I would like to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody knows that this is happening
because we, right now, are in this 1%,
[SPEAKER_00]: this very small population that are
becoming aware of cryptocurrency,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% of the world, which means the value
that exists on all of the cryptocurrency
[SPEAKER_00]: networks, which is currently around $200
to $250 billion, depending on how you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at it, happens to be close to about the
same amount that the Federal Reserve drew
[SPEAKER_00]: down on its balance sheets between
September and October of this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that I share this is that there
is an immense amount of value that is out
[SPEAKER_00]: there in various organizations,
various situations of value, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gold or many hundreds of claims to that
gold that sits on top of gold in bond
[SPEAKER_00]: markets or banking industries and things
like that, that will very likely be
[SPEAKER_00]: subsumed into this cryptocurrency market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that it's going to go that
way is because the blockchain offers a
[SPEAKER_00]: public open source ledger that anybody can
confirm whether or not value has been
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a retail cannabis business who
wants to accept something of value in
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange for their goods and services.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interesting thing about this
masternode network, this Dash masternode
[SPEAKER_00]: network, is they vote on what to fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vote every month on whether or not to
pay the salaries of the core team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vote every month on whether or not to
support events like CanMed or to support
[SPEAKER_00]: the etching and hacking of the new genomes
that medical genomics discovers to a
[SPEAKER_00]: public open source repository that will be
available for as long as the network
[SPEAKER_00]: exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things that I think are for
the public good.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things that are going to
attract people who believe that they
[SPEAKER_00]: should be more empowered financially with
their own data and attract themselves to
[SPEAKER_00]: and opt into this new economy that I'm
hoping that we can build together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the reason that I'm here is to say,
if you want to build this future with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to assist Doug and medical
genomics, and excuse me, I said Doug,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug's been helping me a lot at the event
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And medical genomics in this process of
bringing data to a public space,
[SPEAKER_00]: of bringing value to ourselves,
of removing the controls of the system of
[SPEAKER_00]: control that the current banking and
government institutions offer us,
[SPEAKER_00]: and empower ourselves to exchange value
among one another and exchange information
[SPEAKER_00]: among one another and create public open
source repositories that are censorship
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to change and manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these things are going to be
wonderful for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: A scientific journaling mechanism is going
to be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly where that project is
at, but that's going to be a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that's going to be added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to help build this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I read the Bitcoin white paper in
2015, which I recommend that you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a very interesting kind of financial
political statement once you read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're at all involved in software
or capable of understanding some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: principles that are in this document,
you'll see that the intent of the thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: very simply to say, look, we don't need
these banks anymore, and we don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: governments in the business of printing
money, because we have another option
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and we don't want to centralize that
control in any entity, because as has been
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated throughout history,
whenever we centralize that money and
[SPEAKER_00]: power into an entity, they typically abuse
it, and it attracts corruptible people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those corruptible people often end up
corrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you have a system of corruptible
people, it's a difficult situation to
[SPEAKER_00]: exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I realized that that Bitcoin white
paper offered an exit strategy to humanity
[SPEAKER_00]: that we never had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you all to see this,
help see how this cryptocurrency movement
[SPEAKER_00]: of whom only 1% of the world is aware
right now, of which only 1% of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: is aware right now, we can start to bring
this into our own lives as I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I will warn you at this
point, never, if you are looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: cryptocurrency as an investment,
only invest what you're willing to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, me, when I started investing in the
cryptocurrency industry, I very quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that most of my life I had been
living paycheck to paycheck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really wouldn't make a whole lot of
difference if I just went all in with my
[SPEAKER_00]: crypto and my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started earning everything that I had
in crypto, and I moved everything out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fiat system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm OK losing everything,
because I know that I can start from zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're there with me, I will help
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not there and you just want
to dabble a little bit, come visit us at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dash booth at the exhibitors hall
tonight or tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to close up early
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tomorrow, I'll be there all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll set you up a wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you transacted at least once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can get one of these nice Dash
shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will have received your initiation
into the cryptocurrency industry just that
[SPEAKER_00]: simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'll tell you at this point,
a little bit of context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitcoin was the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, there have been thousands of
cryptocurrencies and tokens that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: created, if you're not aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dash is only one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by measurement of market
capitalization, Dash has always been in
[SPEAKER_00]: the top 20 since it's been introduced into
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole market has fluctuated quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not aware, it peaked as a market
market almost to a trillion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it got to about $878 billion in
market capitalization for the whole market
[SPEAKER_00]: in December, January this past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, again, we're down a huge percent,
almost 60%, 70% down to $200 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it even got lower for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to show you that it is a volatile
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have the guts for that
volatility, again, don't invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But watch this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch how it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to transact, if you want to
gain your privacy, if you want to gain
[SPEAKER_00]: control over your own finances,
pay attention to what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cryptocurrency space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summation, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dash is just one of thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dash is not the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens to be my current favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will jump ship if I think Dash is not
doing what it should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to learn more and start to
get engaged in this space, certainly check
[SPEAKER_00]: out thecryptoshow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm a co-host of that radio show,
which is broadcast on Bloomberg AM radio
[SPEAKER_00]: in five different cities, San Francisco,
Houston, Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of those I always forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's check out thecryptoshow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk bitcoin.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can listen and learn about what's
going on in these cryptocurrency spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come visit us at the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be happy to talk anything that you'd
like about cryptocurrency, software
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I advise a number of people on
blockchain projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I advise merchants on how to build
e-commerce systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be happy to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one interesting note that I should
mention, I do not work for a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dash is the first decentralized autonomous
organization, of which there are many now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a DAO, we're all free agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of us who is working at the
booth is only believing in an ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are not paid to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not paid to speak here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just enthusiastic and wanted to get
this message out to as many places as I
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of cryptocurrency
conferences happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally prefer anything that has
nothing to do specifically with
[SPEAKER_00]: cryptocurrency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I want to thank you all very
much for having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be available for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love to talk about this stuff
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please bother me.
Thank you.
