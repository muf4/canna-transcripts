[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss how
Tim and his team choose which
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochemicals to study, what makes the
varine cannabinoids particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting, the difference between
chemically-derived compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-derived compounds, which
phytochemicals show the most promise for
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutics, and modifying phytochemicals
to improve their effectiveness.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Tim
[SPEAKER_00]: LaFever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Tim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to talk to you today and
excited for the upcoming conference,
[SPEAKER_02]: the CanMed Conference in Florida,
in a couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know it's coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to talk with you today
about the work that you've done to
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate some of the lesser-known
compounds in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we kind of get into which
compounds and cannabinoids you studied and
[SPEAKER_00]: the results that you found, I wanted to
ask what specifically you were
[SPEAKER_00]: investigating, maybe more so, what basic
questions were you looking to answer with
[SPEAKER_00]: this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as most folks in this space are aware,
the cannabis plant is incredibly complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a number of different
cannabinoids, flavonoids, polyphenols.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while some of them are fairly
well-researched, there's many,
[SPEAKER_02]: many others that have just a smattering of
information here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we wanted to do was take a
look at some of these less studied,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit more rare or sometimes called
minor cannabinoids and just get some basic
[SPEAKER_02]: information off of them that can lead us
in directions where we can decide if we
[SPEAKER_02]: want to potentially commercially pursue
them for health benefits or use them as a
[SPEAKER_02]: scaffold in our drug development program
to use medicinal chemistry to optimize
[SPEAKER_02]: them further for therapeutic potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with this work, we chose a number
of different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at both the Delta-8 and the
Delta-9 isomers of THCV as well as CBDV,
[SPEAKER_02]: CBGV, CBCV, CBC and Canflavena.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to think about it for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, some of these have much more
data in the literature than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the basic information was really
around ADME PK data, some physical
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical properties of these cannabinoids,
a little bit of pharmacology work where we
[SPEAKER_02]: chose some selected receptors or ion
channels probing for their activity at
[SPEAKER_02]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, just to get a basic sense of
where these stand so that we can follow up
[SPEAKER_02]: with more comprehensive in vivo biology
studies where we can really nail down
[SPEAKER_02]: efficacy and safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I was hoping you might help me or
help me and I guess the audience to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of define a few of these terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, looking through your
abstract and what you're investigating
[SPEAKER_00]: with these different compounds,
there's pharmacology, physiochemistry and
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was hoping you could kind of define
what are those terms like what what are
[SPEAKER_00]: you really looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe start with pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pharmacology is really just how a
chemical molecule or some some entity
[SPEAKER_02]: interacts with with our system,
most often by binding to and activating or
[SPEAKER_02]: having some effect on a receptor or,
again, an ion channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of lots of different ways you can you
can approach that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to boil it down, it's basically how
does the chemical do what it does?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the body, physical chemistry is
basically just the chemical properties of
[SPEAKER_02]: the compound.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, everything from as basic as
its molecular weight to, say, solubility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in various solvents or phosphate
buffered saline, how soluble is this
[SPEAKER_02]: compound, which is related to how much we
could potentially mix or dose easily which
[SPEAKER_02]: is which is related to, you know,
kind of the ability to commercialize it
[SPEAKER_02]: or, again, identify a characteristic that
we might be able to improve upon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And toxicology is pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it's just really how safe are
these?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's there's many, many,
many ways to approach assessing toxicology
[SPEAKER_02]: of of a chemical or a molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, we decided to go with a C.
[SPEAKER_02]: elegans model that we had some some
familiarity with with some previous work
[SPEAKER_02]: that we found to be a really good early
place to start that gives us a good sign
[SPEAKER_02]: of both some acute and sub chronic
toxicity that we can screen fairly rapidly
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to a more traditional in vivo
rodent model.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that, again, gives us an early
indication of this is one we need to do
[SPEAKER_02]: some more work on or this is one right now
we just don't think it's it's one we want
[SPEAKER_02]: to pursue.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in looking at this in the compounds
that you studied, were there any surprises
[SPEAKER_00]: or sort of results that you weren't
expecting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were there were definitely a few
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was, again, one of one of the
goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these we looked at purely from a
scientific interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, the the Delta 8 and the
Delta 9 THCV isomers, if you if you look
[SPEAKER_02]: across the marketplace right now,
a lot of the THCV isolate products contain
[SPEAKER_02]: a ratio of both isomers in every direction
and permutation you can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to understand a little bit
more about each separately and what are
[SPEAKER_02]: the the pros and cons or the benefits of
having more Delta 8 versus Delta 9 or vice
[SPEAKER_02]: versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, well, they really, you know,
are very similar, much in the same way
[SPEAKER_02]: that Delta 8 THC and Delta 9 THC only
differ by the location of the double bond
[SPEAKER_02]: on the carbon.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's molecularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we did some of our binding and
functional assays, we found that Delta 8
[SPEAKER_02]: seemed to be a little bit stronger
antagonist at CB1 compared to Delta 9
[SPEAKER_02]: THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the exact opposite for the CB2
receptor, Delta 9 THCV was a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger antagonist than Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, the implications there,
once you start to understand some of this
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacology, you can either specifically
generate a ratio of the two isomers to
[SPEAKER_02]: drive a tailored effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or isolate and purify just one isomer and
get the most bang for your buck,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you are investigating Delta 8 THCV
and Delta 9 THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of V's when you're
kind of rattling off all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I know that's that's the Varin
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the term is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so what specifically was interesting
about Varins that there are so many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them in this list?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so the Varins are a little bit
interesting to us.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the difference between the
Varins and the non-Varin cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: acronyms that you're familiar with is,
right, again, just the number of carbons
[SPEAKER_02]: in the alkyl tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Varins have three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CBDV has three.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD has five.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so for for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it still persists a little bit
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks tend to look at the number of
carbons in that in that tail when they
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about agonist activity at CB1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So typically kind of an indicator of how
intoxicating a cannabinoid may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't pursue anything intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in in this case, we see that the
Varins are slightly more pharmacologically
[SPEAKER_02]: promiscuous and are a little bit more like
CBD in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't take a hammer to really any one
particular target or receptor site,
[SPEAKER_02]: but seem to kind of have this general
general activity across several systems
[SPEAKER_02]: that both contribute to health benefits or
therapeutic potential, but also likely
[SPEAKER_02]: safety, as we see with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in doing research for for the
conversation today, I was checking out
[SPEAKER_00]: your website at Nalu Bio, and there's a
lot of talk about having chemistry derived
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds versus hemp derived compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in doing this work, which were you
using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you using hemp derived or chemically
derived?
[SPEAKER_02]: So these these were all synthetic
chemically derived compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is which is our platform at Nalu
Bio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so we believe that the synthetic
synthetic mimics of of phytocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can extract from the plant or
that are present in processed cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: material offer offer some advantages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we've we've decided to
go down that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand that there's there's a lot
of negativity around the word synthetic,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in this space and especially
after the years of the K2 and spice issues
[SPEAKER_02]: that we all are very well aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're hoping that we can kind of get
over that stigma and embrace the what the
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic approach has to offer from a
both consistency standpoint, from batch to
[SPEAKER_02]: batch consistency, which is achievable
with with with plant derived extracts,
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also that that we're able to explore
some of these more minor or rare
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids that at this point,
the genetics don't exist or they're in
[SPEAKER_02]: process to make extracting from the plant
not very feasible or not sustainable,
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly from an environmental
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what what kind of levels are we talking
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of these compounds, what is the
typical amount that the plant produces?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were the levels that you were
using in your investigation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd have to look to get really accurate
answers for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of these very, very small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know CBDV, there are some varieties from
Africa that produce, I think, four or five
[SPEAKER_02]: percent, maybe a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if GW has done some of that
work as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but very small amounts, nothing like
like Delta 9 THC or CBD at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I will say that Phylos has
recently put out a press release that that
[SPEAKER_02]: they have achieved genetics for a very
high Delta 9 THCV plant that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and and extracting from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if you could explain a little bit
about how are you kind of deriving these
[SPEAKER_00]: chemically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that for example, with Delta 8 THC,
it's kind of using the CBD molecule and
[SPEAKER_00]: treating it with acid to sort of convert
it into Delta 8 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a similar process that you're using
now where you're using a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid as a base and then
transforming it?
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, how we approach the synthesis
for for any cannabinoid is tailored
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically to that to that cannabinoid
so as we begin to explore what's the best
[SPEAKER_02]: route, we look at the various input
materials, what's going to give us the
[SPEAKER_02]: best yield, the best purity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as we begin to hone in on what's
that optimized synthesis, we further tweak
[SPEAKER_02]: it as we need to go from bench scale up to
say kilogram scale synthesis work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some more tweaks in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the very long answer is some rely on
other cannabinoids as input materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others use other input materials like
Diverinol or Alivetol, which are very
[SPEAKER_02]: common in this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But each one is different and specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now of the phytochemicals you studied,
which have the most promise and why?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with these basic studies, it's a little
bit of a tease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're just kind of scratching the
surface enough to get very excited about a
[SPEAKER_02]: few of them for a few different reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And others are left scratching your head
that you thought going into it,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I really thought you might see
something there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So across the board, more work is going to
be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can say that with the work we just
completed, in my opinion, based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: data we have, I would think CBGV and
Canflavin A are particularly interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canflavin A has been published on a little
bit over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It occurs minute amounts in the plant,
which has hampered its research to some
[SPEAKER_02]: extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has fairly profound
anti-inflammatory properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a polyphenol, it's pretty
interesting to explore that space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of a departure from,
say, the traditional cannabinoids we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the case of CBGV, this is one,
again, there's limited information out
[SPEAKER_02]: there about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it set itself apart from the pack on a
couple of key ADME metrics like half-life
[SPEAKER_02]: and microsomal stability that looked a lot
more like what you see in typical
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutics in the marketplace today,
which was a very nice surprise for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So explain that a little bit more
specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with CBGV, we did several different
soluble solubility assays.
[SPEAKER_02]: As working with cannabinoids, a common
issue is that they're not very soluble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we wanted to understand where these
fall in relation to some standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did some kinetic solubility,
some thermodynamic solubility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And across all of these, what you see is
that you can achieve the highest
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration with CBGV compared to all of
the other phytochemicals we tested in
[SPEAKER_02]: those assays, which just basically means
it's more soluble than most, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: very good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In what way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just that it's easier to mix and get
into higher concentrations in,
[SPEAKER_02]: say, a beverage or an oil or a format
where you can deliver more of the compound
[SPEAKER_02]: without it precipitating out, or you can
maintain homogeneity of your finished good
[SPEAKER_02]: so that when someone is taking it,
you can potentially deliver less compound
[SPEAKER_02]: and achieve the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's less so sort of its interaction
with the body, but it's more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing problem that it's solving
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give you a more consistent
product?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of both, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on the microsomal stability and the
half-life work that we did, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: basically you're looking at how the
molecule is moving across different
[SPEAKER_02]: microsomes, in this case, liver
microsomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so again, what we saw is that CBGV had
the greatest half-life, so more of it was
[SPEAKER_02]: sticking around, which speaks more,
again, to its metabolic profile,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also that it had a better transporter
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was able to move more freely than some
of these other cannabinoids, which again,
[SPEAKER_02]: it caught us by surprise and certainly now
gives us motivation to continue following
[SPEAKER_02]: up with some in vivo work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you brought up that term
because I wanted to talk about sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between in vitro and in vivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you can't really predict the
future, but when moving from in vitro to
[SPEAKER_00]: in vivo, how can sort of these results or
like you said, you get excited about a
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can then when you translate that into
in vivo, how can that sort of how can
[SPEAKER_00]: things change?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually I say the the translatability
from in vitro to in vivo is pretty high,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on depending on the data that
you're using to inform the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the in vitro data, say, is in vitro
biology data about, say, the pharmacology,
[SPEAKER_02]: so the binding and the functional assays
we ran.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you if you get a good understanding
of this molecule has this activity at this
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor and this receptor mediates these
effects or interactions, you can follow
[SPEAKER_02]: that up in vivo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And typically you can you can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, if you see CB1 agonism,
right, you would say, OK, now we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to put this into an in vivo model and
subsequently will see analgesia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a common Delta 9 THC effect in
rodents or any CB1 agonists with with
[SPEAKER_02]: really any decent efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about when you were
talking about CBGV, so based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacology there, like, do you have any
idea like what sort of conditions that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be helpful for?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit tricky on the on the
pharmacology side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do a little bit more work
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in in some of the in vivo work that
we've done that I hope to be able to have
[SPEAKER_02]: some more data to present in a few weeks,
it seems to be very stimulating,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is also interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're seeing a dose effect there,
which in the model we used can sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: be predictive of neuroprotective effects,
which can come into play when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at, say, traumatic brain injury or
Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of different ways to approach
those and they're very complex studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm I'm pretty excited at the chance
to to explore CBGV CB1 CBGV further in
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these models and really start to
understand what we've got on our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now have you done work to investigate
sort of combining these different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds to see what the effects are?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know that the entourage effect
is is real.
Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so our approach at this point is really
trying to to screen these minor rare
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, you know, through our
platform and get an idea or rank them
[SPEAKER_02]: really by those that we feel have have the
data behind them to pursue further for
[SPEAKER_02]: either a commercial pipeline or to use as
a scaffold for our therapeutic program.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but at this point, we haven't combined
any.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think we're we're hoping that we're
adding value by adding to the knowledge we
[SPEAKER_02]: know about these individual cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while I don't think we'll ever be able
to recreate the chemical complexity that
[SPEAKER_02]: leads to the entourage effect,
I think our goal is is that if we
[SPEAKER_02]: understand enough about these cannabinoids
or other phytochemicals individually,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can start to thoughtfully put them
together with with other phytochemicals or
[SPEAKER_02]: with existing bioactive nutraceuticals or
health supplements to to really bolster
[SPEAKER_02]: specific effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not having to worry about the the
myriad of other other chemicals that may
[SPEAKER_02]: be in the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, and that was something that I
noticed when I was looking at the website
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, was sort of this idea of sort of
combining the compounds, the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: with other vitamins or probiotics,
proteins, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that you're
investigating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the commercial side of the business is
is actively exploring existing combination
[SPEAKER_02]: supplements and how the introduction or
the addition of a cannabinoid or more than
[SPEAKER_02]: one cannabinoid may further enhance their
effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've identified several that have a
very solid clinical literature space
[SPEAKER_02]: behind them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very solid as far as efficacy is
concerned from a safety profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're now taking what we've learned
about some cannabinoids and putting those
[SPEAKER_02]: in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, once we start getting
these manufactured, the intent is to do
[SPEAKER_02]: some small clinical trials or focus groups
to understand their efficacy in humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now which compounds are you looking to
kind of move into the next phase of of
[SPEAKER_00]: your work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, definitely Canflavin A and CBD,
as I mentioned, they it's a little early
[SPEAKER_02]: on those two to be involved in the in the
combination products we're just talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but we definitely want to understand a
little bit more about those and as I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: if if there's potential for them on their
own, that's that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the really interesting part about
this, the Nalu kind of ecosystem is that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have this commercial side where we're
developing the synthetic approaches for
[SPEAKER_02]: these phyto cannabinoid mimics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that also informs us on the
therapeutic side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our drug development side where we can
take what we know about existing phyto
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids or phytochemicals and do some
of this work that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: today and then say, you know what,
that has a lot of therapeutic potential,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not very drug like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very soluble or it's rapidly
metabolized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can we use medicinal chemistry to
modify that molecule and improve upon
[SPEAKER_02]: those characteristics while also either
retaining or improving the pharmacological
[SPEAKER_02]: activity for the indication or the
endpoint that that we're looking at?
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, it's it's it's this like I say,
it's kind of this feedback loop loop
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystem we have where no matter what
data we're collecting on either side of
[SPEAKER_02]: the business, we're learning more and more
and more about these different structure
[SPEAKER_02]: activity relationships and how we can take
that knowledge to inform really either
[SPEAKER_02]: side of our business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, when you were talking
before about CBGV and its being soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: and that being a good characteristic,
are you sort of saying that you can look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the structure of that molecule and
maybe apply some of that to maybe another
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule that isn't as soluble to try to
give it that ability?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, what what we're trying to do
and what a lot of folks do with structure
[SPEAKER_02]: activity relationships is is by looking at
the properties of a number of molecules,
[SPEAKER_02]: so a large sample size, you start you can
start to see patterns emerge where then
[SPEAKER_02]: you can you can more confidently say,
OK, so making a modification here seems to
[SPEAKER_02]: be critical for X.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you get large enough data
sets, you can you can start to tease those
[SPEAKER_02]: things apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then absolutely, you can you can start
to tinker molecularly tinker with with
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have the first phase of anything
we do at Nalu is is our in silico
[SPEAKER_02]: platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so we have several different modeling
capabilities where we will put some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these rare minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also use it for novel chemical entities
that we we develop for the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_02]: side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're able to model how these might
interact with different biological
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: From metabolism to PK, as well as their
pharmacology, so how they interact with
[SPEAKER_02]: certain receptors in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of our first pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we see favorable results come out
of that work, that's when we move into the
[SPEAKER_02]: type of work we're talking about now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to confirm that the data we've
we've modeled using, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: PCAM work, add me work in vitro studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's step two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we continue to see favorable
results, we keep we keep investigating
[SPEAKER_02]: them until we have a very, very strong
profile and rationale for
[SPEAKER_02]: commercialization or therapeutic work.
[SPEAKER_02]: About how long does that whole process
take?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on if if if we have the target
validated from a from, say, molecular
[SPEAKER_02]: docking perspective, it's not too bad if
we have to validate a new target that that
[SPEAKER_02]: can take us, you know, a couple of weeks,
maybe depending on the complexity and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, depending on if we're looking
at, say, the orthostatic sites versus
[SPEAKER_02]: allosteric sites, what kind of training
sets are already available.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's it's it's pretty amazing how much
this has evolved in just the last few
[SPEAKER_02]: years, especially with with machine
learning and AI.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's evolving very, very quickly and
becoming an incredibly useful tool that I
[SPEAKER_02]: think most biotechs and pharma companies
are becoming actively reliant on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's certainly been working very well
for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, any any data we collect,
you know, anything we collect,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's our data or something we find
in the literature, we can put that data
[SPEAKER_02]: back into our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to refine its its
predictions going going on so that we get
[SPEAKER_02]: more accuracy, better confidence in what
our models are predicting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the in silico work that you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the in silico in vitro in vivo
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that whole process?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does that all take?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so on the commercial side, so if we're
just trying to understand a rare,
[SPEAKER_02]: say, CBGV, for example, if we wanted to
work that through to the point we have
[SPEAKER_02]: enough confidence to to start exploring
how to how to synthesize it and optimize
[SPEAKER_02]: that synthesis, you know, we could we
could maybe maybe six months to a year
[SPEAKER_02]: before we really have a good
understanding, maybe a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_02]: if we if we really wanted to explore a
couple of different endpoints on the
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutic side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, that's the you know,
the drug development pipeline is is a
[SPEAKER_02]: much, much, much longer game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stakes are a little bit a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so if we were to use, again,
just CBGV, for example, as a scaffold and
[SPEAKER_02]: using our computer aided drug design.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to say, generate, you know,
five hundred, six hundred novel chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: entities based off of CBGV, then running
those through, say, we get a few that look
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may do another round of computer aided
drug design or medicinal chemistry to
[SPEAKER_02]: further refine those those NCEs into
potential hits that then we start to,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, verify use physically in these very
basic in vitro assays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you know, then from there,
it's it's more refinement, more refinement
[SPEAKER_02]: and more work until you eventually get a a
lead candidate that you really want to
[SPEAKER_02]: push forward and hope that you get into
first in human studies and clinical work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that that, you know, probably a couple
of years, you know, at best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might get lucky, but but yeah,
we're we're we're moving along at a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: good clip for our size.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's if somebody figures out
how to speed that process up, they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so the goal is, if I'm hearing you
correctly, is to actually find a novel
[SPEAKER_00]: compound that sort of mimics the action of
the natural compound and then
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or or we enhance that activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can we can explore ways to say change
the you know, we can try to to make
[SPEAKER_02]: modifications and maybe say add bias to to
these molecules or which which signaling
[SPEAKER_02]: pathway they may they may prefer over
another, knowing that activating one
[SPEAKER_02]: pathway may have common side effects that
we want to avoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so so that's that's just an example of
one way that we can we can keep working on
[SPEAKER_02]: this and again get to hopefully a very
safe and effective therapeutic or a
[SPEAKER_02]: library that we can we can begin to use
structure, activity, relationship work to
[SPEAKER_02]: to really try to find the key components
that we can exploit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, winding down here, before I let you
go, I wanted to give you an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: share any other resources that you think
folks might be interested in reading more
[SPEAKER_00]: about if they're interested in this topic
and also any information about you in Nalu
[SPEAKER_00]: bio that you'd like to share.

[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be happy to put any links in the
show description so people can find it
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think I don't have any
specific resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can you can check out our website and
learn a little bit more about about what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're trying to to do at Nalu and our
approach to to synthetic cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it be, you know, synthetic mimics
of phytos or our therapeutic pipeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can't really I can't really think
of any other other resources to to send
[SPEAKER_02]: folks to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that the majority of this data,
if not, if not all of it, we'll we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: begin packaging up and we'll hopefully get
get out in a peer reviewed publication
[SPEAKER_02]: here before the end of the year and hope
to have many, many other publications
[SPEAKER_00]: following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
