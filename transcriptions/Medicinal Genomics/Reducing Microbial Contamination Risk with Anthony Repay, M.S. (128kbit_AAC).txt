[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring has sprung and March is nearly
over, which means that CanMed 23 is right
[SPEAKER_00]: around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really excited about the event this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of great things planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Monday, May 15th, we will be holding
four immersive professional development
[SPEAKER_00]: workshops, including our full day medical
practicum, a cultivation workshop focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on plant pathogens, a capital markets
workshop focused on funding cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: innovation, and a newly designed lab
compliance testing workshop that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about potency inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following two days will feature oral
presentations that were curated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed advisory board that cover topics
like hoplate and viroid, the medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: value of minor cannabinoids and
flavonoids, Delta THC, and much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have two amazing beach dinners
planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The May 15th dinner will include a tribute
to Professor Machulam, who sadly passed
[SPEAKER_00]: away earlier this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meal will include remarks from
Professor Lumiere Hannes, Deddy Meary,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Brendan McKernan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attendees will also have the opportunity
to commemorate Professor Machulam during
[SPEAKER_00]: the special program planned for the
evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Hannes will be presenting at the
May 16th dinner as well on the topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: how cannabis became medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we have packed a lot of
excellent content into the three-day
[SPEAKER_00]: summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't even mentioned the
world-class accommodations and amenities
[SPEAKER_00]: that attendees can enjoy at the Marriott
Marco Island Beach Resort.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information is at canmedevents
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go there today, and I hope to see you in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Anthony Rapay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony is currently serving as the
Laboratory Director of Method Testing
[SPEAKER_00]: Laboratories in Tampa, Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony started his career as the Head
Food and Environmental Microbiologist at a
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicago-based testing laboratory before
joining the cannabis science community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since joining cannabis, Anthony has tried
to innovate and push the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology community by publishing
peer-reviewed papers, speaking on proper
[SPEAKER_00]: quality control, and volunteering in
several nationwide cannabis groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discussed how
growers can incorporate microbial testing
[SPEAKER_00]: into their processes, sources of microbial
contamination, and tips for prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: How differences in microbial regulations
influence growers in certain states,
[SPEAKER_00]: remediation technologies, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Anthony, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, RS Biotherapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: RS Biotherapeutics' mission is to harness
the therapeutic power of cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_00]: the research, development, and
commercialization of life-changing
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: RS Biotherapeutics' first investigational
compound is a nebulized, semi-synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiolic acid complex in development
to address exacerbation and prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: progression of both acute and chronic
pulmonary inflammation related to
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory diseases, including COPD,
SARS-CoV-2, cystic fibrosis, asthma,
[SPEAKER_00]: bronchitis, and acute respiratory
disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: More information on RS Biotherapeutics can
be found at rsbiotherapeutics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Anthony
[SPEAKER_00]: Rapay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Anthony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to talk with you today
about a topic that's near and dear to our
[SPEAKER_00]: hearts here at Medicinal Genomics,
and that's microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you might expect, us being one of the
most widely used cannabis microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: testing platforms, it's a topic we've
explored before.
[SPEAKER_00]: In prior episodes, we've talked about the
value of microbial testing when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to patient and consumer safety,
and we've talked with laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals like yourself about some of
the differences in testing techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I know that are topics that you're
well qualified to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, I'm interested in talking with
you about the grower's perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly what should growers know about
microbial testing, and perhaps most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, what are things that they can
do to reduce their microbial contamination
[SPEAKER_00]: risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start us off, I'd like to ask you,
in your experience, how concerned are
[SPEAKER_00]: growers with microbial testing,
and where does it rank on their list of
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So honestly, I believe it's one of the
most talked about, if not the most talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about subject, at least in the grower's
perspective, and we have these issues
[SPEAKER_01]: where microbials, they're not seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, we have some powdery
mildew, and we have visible mold growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: botrytis, and all of these different
things that are visible, but when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to generic microbial, it's hard to detect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of, I sub-categorize different
things between chemistry and microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most laboratories, pretty have a pretty
robust chemistry department that will
[SPEAKER_01]: allow them to do pesticide screening,
heavy metal screening, things that can
[SPEAKER_01]: cause compliance failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas on the microbial side,
unfortunately, it often happens where you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see it until it's kind of too late,
and that's where I feel like the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental monitoring aspect of it all
is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it definitely is, it's a question that
I get often, maybe two to three times a
[SPEAKER_01]: week is, hey, I'm failing for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on, and how can I fix this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kind of, I know it's on
everybody's radar, especially as we look
[SPEAKER_01]: at different states, and we look at
different multi-state operations that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to bring a cookie-cutter
approach to different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, for instance, if we look at,
so previous to my tenureship came from
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada, and so we have a whole different
experience or threshold testing and
[SPEAKER_01]: present-absent testing that goes into the
Nevada regulations, whereas currently I
[SPEAKER_01]: reside in Florida and do compliance
testing in Florida, and we have a,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say completely different,
but we do have less things to test for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Nevada, we're testing for
enterobacteria, total coliform analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in Florida, for threshold testing,
and your present absence are basically the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Florida, we're generically just
testing for total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we bring these cookie-cutter
approaches to different MMTCs or different
[SPEAKER_01]: places, it can struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best I can say is keeping a good,
clean operation is my first approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd be shocked when you go into some
of these places and you see what is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think back to previous places that
I've had where I was visiting,
[SPEAKER_01]: and of course, I can't say any names,
but I don't know if I can even say that in
[SPEAKER_01]: your podcast, but I think back to
different places I've toured, and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: failing for mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, okay, yeah, let's figure
this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I come on site?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course I come on site and I'm like,
well, you have standing water with,
[SPEAKER_01]: with mold on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, you know that if it's
in your, your facility as a whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very easy to get trapped into the
grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and just, it needs to be clean from
front to step, you know, from front of the
[SPEAKER_01]: house to the back of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the cleanliness is the first
place that I start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's just how, how it should
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we think of these like,
I mean, this is, this is people's
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that is it's a, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only do you have the botany
approach to, to keeping things controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: and aseptic and clean, but you also have
that this should be also as clean as a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical grade facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should be treated like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that it definitely is one of the
larger questions that I hear from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk about microbial,
it's, it's hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with a lot of, you mentioned
powdery mildew and now hoplite and viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: is another thing that's hot on everyone's
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that are actually
affecting the health of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that can be sort of
apparent to a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would imagine that in a lot of
cases, growers don't really know that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a problem with microbial
contamination until they send a sample to
[SPEAKER_00]: labs like yourself and they get the
results back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where so like each state again
is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Florida, for instance, we have a
pretty heavy R and D side of testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, when samples are
submitted, they're more often than not,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're submitted for R and D testing
first before they're packaged in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we do post-packaged testing here in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do, you know, R and D testing,
screen it for their, their pathogens,
[SPEAKER_01]: their, their microbes that could be
failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they package it,
and then you get the compliance testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're kind of doing it twice to
confirm on the front end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would see it on that R and D side
so that they can do some remediation and
[SPEAKER_01]: anything along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, but then on the packaging side
is when things get difficult, where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have compliance failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, those are very costly
from a, not only from the, from a grower
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint, but from just trying to figure
out what, what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, that, I mean, the,
the question, I guess the key of it all is
[SPEAKER_01]: that, I mean, test, test early and test
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is, is don't, it is costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you have different avenues to
kind of do things here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can do, you know, in-house
screening, you could do, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: submitting R and D samples to a third
party testing to do out of house testing
[SPEAKER_01]: to just kind of screen for these to
monitor where it comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also comes in how you mentioned how,
like, you don't really know if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem until you have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how your grow is set up
truly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've been to several
different grows now where some of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: very compartmentalized, where the grow
tables are actually in for, for your guys'
[SPEAKER_01]: visual reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, it was an old like storage unit
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would, they converted,
they can like these large multi-room
[SPEAKER_01]: grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like from a microbial standpoint,
it made me really happy because these
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms were segregated to a fact that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this was this one, they had
dedicated ventilation, no crossover.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way that a microbe could get in
was through the door or from person to
[SPEAKER_01]: person transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from those instances, you can kind
of subject it and kind of look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: results and, okay, so room 12 has been
failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've failed, you know, 10 of our last 20
lots out of room 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we doing in room 12?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where your remediation steps
come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the room comes down, you go
through your drying process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you cleaning properly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we cleaning the air ducts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we cleaning the ducts all the way
properly?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are these next steps to make sure
that that next grow, that next harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes into that room is also not
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other side, the flip side of
it, I've seen grows where they're giant
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one giant room full of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, each table is, you know,
is that, you know, table one, table two,
[SPEAKER_01]: table three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if that's the case,
if you're having a trouble in that one
[SPEAKER_01]: room, you could cost you your whole grow
at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's best to find a way to kind of
separate and then, you know, treat each
[SPEAKER_01]: table or treat each room as its own
separate entity so that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance, when, you know, and it comes
to strains too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like some strains seem to have a
denser, you know, more robust,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, bud would be the term I would
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some are not as big, you know,
they tend to grow, you know, smaller buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And treating each one of those different
with the light cycles and the cleaning
[SPEAKER_01]: cycles is just important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and you make a good point of test
early and test often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how early and how often?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is it throughout the plant's sort
of life cycle or is that sort of just
[SPEAKER_00]: taken as, you know, one point in time and
then it's the process of testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the drying, the curing or is it all the
above?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like how often should they be testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, again, from the microbiologist
perspective and of course, from the third
[SPEAKER_01]: party labs perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take that into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also more testing is also is much
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for instance, in a previous
tenureship, we had a customer that would
[SPEAKER_01]: as soon as those plants were propagated or
excuse me, as soon as they were grown,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would then first give them viral
screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so they were in this quarantine state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did viral screening on these to confirm
that we did not have any hoplatin virus
[SPEAKER_01]: was his bread and butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a previous job.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you get burned from
once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did a hoplatin on it in the early
screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did a just generic
environmental screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So speaking of like state to state and how
often do you screen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some states differ in the way that their R
&D processes are allowed, for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to find ways to get a
representation of what that sample could
[SPEAKER_01]: give you on a microbial standpoint by
testing the environment around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, quite frankly, by putting in a
robust environmental monitoring program
[SPEAKER_01]: will allow you to just kind of get a
general idea of how your facility is
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, but also the idea of how that room
or that row is doing specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the easiest way to do this is to do
zoning techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is pretty good lab practice,
but also pretty pretty normal in your
[SPEAKER_01]: routine grows when it comes to like
lettuce testing, tomato testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but and then also food testing as well as
setting up a zone network of how often do
[SPEAKER_01]: things come into contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously your your trimming scissors,
your your tables, your lines, your lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: your tanks, all of those things impact
your production every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those should be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: More frequent than the things that attack
that affect your samples on a weekly or a
[SPEAKER_01]: monthly basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I when working with quality
departments that grows, we first develop a
[SPEAKER_01]: list and then we do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your zone one is your everyday and your
zone four is our things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we use that once or twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had a grow that barely did pre
rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We barely use the pre roll machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So OK, so we're going to put that in zone
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're barely using this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pre roll machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put that in zone one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're always doing fresh flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's put the trimming scissors and the
trimming table on zone one and the
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency at which we test those should be
reflected upon that and to give you a good
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, setting up a zone in a grid
like pattern for your actual grow
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I what I mean by that is
microbials tend to interact in in
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions that are favorable for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, you can use indicator
organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like your total yeast and mold,
your enterobacteria, your your total
[SPEAKER_01]: coliform to get a general idea of the
cleanliness and and how your flour will
[SPEAKER_01]: perform on a microbial standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's you know, the hot topic for at
least in Florida and for everybody is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's total yeast and mold and
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, everyone likes to talk about
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone likes to talk about total yeast
and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total aspergillus, I'm just going to not
make any headlines here, but aspergillus
[SPEAKER_01]: is a mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will be encompassed in a total yeast
and test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, by doing generic total
yeast and mold analysis on different areas
[SPEAKER_01]: in your grid like pattern in your
facility, you can then kind of think how
[SPEAKER_01]: likely will aspergillus grow in these
conditions because they're more favorable
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow in things that are favorable to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So setting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, for instance, when I would go
into when I talked earlier about the the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation that was from a kind of like
an old storage unit facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I treated every room in a grid like
pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would go, you know, front,
middle, back, side, side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we'd find is that there was not a
lot of light that was growing in the back
[SPEAKER_01]: left corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: This often yielded and popped high on my
total yeast and mold environmental tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were also feeling for a lot of
yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as we're focusing the clean on
those hotspots that we know tend to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: that total yeast and mold, they you're
going to cut down on your failures or at
[SPEAKER_01]: least try to cut down on your failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I say is, OK, we find the
hotspots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I throw a large net into the sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find the hotspots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find what works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you start to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come in for a retest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We test those spots to make sure that your
cleaning analysis is actually sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do it again and we find a new
hotspot and we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't find hotspots,
but we just find what I call like warm
[SPEAKER_01]: spots, things that we should be kind of
either on my radar, but they may or may
[SPEAKER_01]: not be causing failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we move on that,
we just know what the best lab practices
[SPEAKER_01]: are or what the best cleaning practices
are for that specific facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just think back to like
Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even here in Florida, it's they're all
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you may find buildings that
are, you know, transformed from a
[SPEAKER_01]: different purpose or some that are built
out specifically for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all the ways of remediation
and the ways of combating this microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: is all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those are two wildly different
climates, too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I think, you know,
the threshold testings are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, for instance, when you talk about
Nevada, for flower, the failure limit is
[SPEAKER_01]: 10,000 CFU.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking Florida, you're
talking 10,000 CFU.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you think of like Illinois,
the threshold is 1,000 CFU.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those three, I guess, as a previous
resident of Illinois, but those are three
[SPEAKER_01]: radically different climates that that,
you know, you have to be playful to the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that which is that your
samples are subjected to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have to imagine that having
such widely different thresholds for the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, I mean, those are going to be I
mean, if you're looking at Illinois,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, that one hundred that one
thousand CFU threshold is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty difficult to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's yeah, it's definitely and so
you're going to see a lot more indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: grows because it's more favorable to
climates that they can control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, it snows there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I keep moving away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the it's you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make sure that when in those
more rigid testing facilities or states
[SPEAKER_01]: that more is in your control to the best
of your ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that also comes with a double
edged sword because it's much harder to
[SPEAKER_01]: get rid of a microbial contamination in an
indoor facility because it gets stuck in
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, in the HVAC systems and the
different systems that are just built into
[SPEAKER_01]: those facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to this whole idea of
testing early, testing often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like from the examples you
provided, you're not testing the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more testing the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two ways of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're kind of at the you're kind of at
the mercy of what the requirements are for
[SPEAKER_01]: the state to state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like how rigid is the R&D process?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for instance, like for Nevada,
for R&D testing to to be even submitted to
[SPEAKER_01]: a state or to a compliance laboratory,
written approval must be sent in to the
[SPEAKER_01]: board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for instance, and then in Florida,
it's very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get R&D samples and I get the compliance
samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so each state is just different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for instance, if you're in a state
that heavily is allowant of R&D testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I would say, let's do the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how the plant is is interacting
with its surroundings throughout its
[SPEAKER_01]: lifecycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's great to have a great
environmental monitoring program on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, because you can also save on sending
me samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in a more rigid environment
where and neither one is right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in a more rigid environment
where R&D testing is maybe a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more hard to come by, is the is the phrase
I'd say, then environmental monitoring is
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe your only choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you need to get the vast
amount of your data at.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and so I'm going to throw an example
at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say I'm testing the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a few weeks away still from harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've identified a contamination
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the steps that they can take to
reduce that microbial load potentially on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and get a passing grade?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, man, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there are several different
remediation steps out there that take
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: What often I think about is the radiation
that you can subject your plant to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can, you know, first kill off any
target microbes from that instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also ozone radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also ozone that can be subjected
onto the plant itself in a drying phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are ways to kind of when
you're at that last level where you've
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like we need to to find a
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the the ultimate thing is if you
get a failing, you could always turn it
[SPEAKER_01]: into an extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the nice thing about cannabis
is that there is there is like waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: The waste of the actual plant can be used
and utilized into a different form of
[SPEAKER_01]: product for the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to get your thoughts sort of
on radiation and some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilization techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it affect the quality of the
product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know too much about that,
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, when it comes to quality of
the product, I can I don't know where you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to cut that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know too much about it,
to be completely honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard multiple things where it
depends who you talk to, to be completely
[SPEAKER_01]: honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in being in the third party testing
facility, I don't I don't get too much in
[SPEAKER_01]: the weeds of that when it comes to when it
comes to the effect of the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you you think, you know,
I hear some people that are very purist,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are like it it affects the terpenes
and it affects the potency of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you hear the people that heavily
rely on these radiation or these
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilization or remediation methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say it doesn't do anything as a
third party testing facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not done enough research to kind of
like give my say on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on on who you talk to and
what they have to say about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would be something interesting to
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that each company has done their
own and their their own maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if let's just say like,
you know, a radiation person may be
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, well, this is what ozone does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ozone says, no, we don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what radiation does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're kind of like, well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of double edged on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to go back to talking about kind of
cleaning up the hot spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you were talking about when you
identify them in a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the best methods for doing
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is it using a bleach solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other methods like?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the things that I recommend
is always like a 10 percent bleach
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do you you get rid of a lot of
like if you're if you so if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial lab, not only do you get rid of
the amplicons and the different kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial mess that can be harming you on
that, but it's also a great way to just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of sterilizing and kind of clean your
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I know that people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, for instance, the I've seen labs
or excuse me, I've seen grows that have
[SPEAKER_01]: done like a UV light treatment and then
they've gone in after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done an overnight UV light
treatment and then they go around and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they do an ozone bomb and then then
they'll come in and then they'll wear,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, masks and they'll do a 10
percent bleach kind of soap of the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll clean the whole facility and then
they'll let it dry and then it's ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's that in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: My opinion is, you know, you're going
above and beyond, but your fail rates low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as the ends justify the means,
that's that's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sure, making sure that you have
cleaners, 10 percent bleach is what I
[SPEAKER_01]: always recommend for my growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're saying to that, you know,
once you're when you're turning over a
[SPEAKER_00]: room, once you've done a harvest and
cleaned everything out, do it do a good
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilization before you're introducing
new plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be surprised with like like what can
be left on those walls and what can be
[SPEAKER_01]: left on the ceilings and in the HVACs,
in the especially in the dry rooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the dry rooms, you're not only in some
cases you have a humidifier, some cases
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to cure the product while
having a heavily ventilated area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cross contamination can be can be
massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making sure you're also turning over
those rooms equally as well as you do your
[SPEAKER_01]: actual grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there are there environmental
conditions that growers should kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: strive for to kind of create an
environment that's not so hospitable for
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial growth or is it sort of hard to
do that when you're dealing with an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very hard to do with an organic
plant because, you know, at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, we need to think about we are growing
a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in these fungal these fungal problems,
they're natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they tend to thrive in the in the
natural environment that these plants also
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's while you while you have the
optimal grow for your your cannabis actual
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, you also are putting in a pretty
optimal environment for the for the target
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen that could be subjected to a
failure for that sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in closing here, I'm wondering if you
have just some some takeaway messages or
[SPEAKER_00]: just some general tips for growers and
maybe even home growers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if people are listening in who
maybe grow cannabis themselves and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: are concerned about any potential
microbial contamination they might have
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your what are some some tips or best
practices they should be keeping in mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of like my best practices are,
again, test early, test often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't be afraid to ask your laboratory
for advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we are I hope hopefully at the
point right now in the the industry that
[SPEAKER_01]: the laboratories should be well versed on
the microbial contaminations that are
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring and problematic in their
specific state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they if they're not, then you need
to ask someone else, maybe a consultant
[SPEAKER_01]: that can help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, setting up a grid like pattern,
knowing where your hot spots are and also
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilizing after the grow are just going
to not only they're going to help keep
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow cleaner and in fact,
in doing so, hopefully limit the failures
[SPEAKER_01]: that your grow is then subjected to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I let you go, Anthony, I want to
give you an opportunity to plug any sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of resources that you know of or maybe you
you've put together that listeners might
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to take a look at to learn more
about this topic and definitely let us
[SPEAKER_00]: know about any social media or websites
that that you have or with Method Testing
[SPEAKER_00]: that are more about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, I'm going to plug Method
Testing Laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a compliance laboratory down here in
Tampa, Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do have any sort of microbial
question, obviously, I can't test your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis if you're in California or in
Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I do have a LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty active, pretty responsive on
LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you if you guys do have any questions
or if anyone just has comments or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's it's still a growing
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would I would say I would have too
big of a head to say I know everything
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would love to not only expand on
resources, but networking opportunities
[SPEAKER_01]: that can allow us to just kind of grow as
an industry together, because ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how we're going to get better as an
industry is if if we grow, we network,
[SPEAKER_01]: we talk about the different problems that
are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, at Method Testing
Laboratories, we're always here to help
[SPEAKER_01]: from not only a testing facility
standpoint, but also microbial standpoint
[SPEAKER_01]: with having not only myself, but an expert
group of microbiologists here on staff
[SPEAKER_01]: that are able to help at whatever we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that all the all the best labs
that we work with take that same approach
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, they're not just returning
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to work with the grower and try
to help solve their problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think your your approach to
collaboration definitely is in line with
[SPEAKER_00]: our our credo here at CanMed as well of
trying to bring together the the best and
[SPEAKER_00]: brightest in the industry to try to push
everything forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kudos to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Anthony, thank you again for
