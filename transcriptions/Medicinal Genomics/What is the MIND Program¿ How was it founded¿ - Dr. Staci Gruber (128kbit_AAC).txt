[SPEAKER_00]: And then took a few years off,
but now we're excited to have you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and your presentation will share data
from several clinical trials that you and
[SPEAKER_00]: your team are performing as part of the
mind program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a bit about the mind program,
why it was founded and how it's 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: of research have led you to this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first, I will say this, I'm
delighted to be heading back to CanMed
[SPEAKER_01]: this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I was part of early, early CanMed
meetings and thought, and still think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really one of the best meetings there,
there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think it's a great opportunity
to interact with people from lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: different areas, um, related to cannabis
and cannabinoid based, um, work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mind program did just celebrate its
10 year anniversary, which seems odd to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I will tell you, I spent several
decades looking among other things at the
[SPEAKER_01]: impact of recreational cannabis on
different aspects of function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cognitive performance and clinical
outcome measures of brain structure and
[SPEAKER_01]: function, you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had done lots of different studies,
again, looking at the impact of
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when Massachusetts was on the
precipice of legalizing medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I scoured the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, let me see, what do we know
about the long-term effects of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as you probably know, cannabis was
re-legalized in this country in 1996 in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And despite that, interestingly enough,
there really was nothing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: literature, nothing at all about long-term
effects of medical cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found some evidence for certain types of
studies that looked at, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a quick and dirty, if you will,
um, assessment of cognition as part of a
[SPEAKER_01]: different kind of very short type of
study, but nothing that was long-term,
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing that followed patients over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly nothing that looked at
cognition or clinical outcomes as a
[SPEAKER_01]: primary focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I launched marijuana investigation
for neuroscientific discovery or the MIND
[SPEAKER_01]: program with the singular focus of looking
at the long-term impact of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, I think a number of
people were sort of like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can do what you,
you can try to look at these folks over
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but these are primarily recreational
people who are really just looking for a
[SPEAKER_01]: legal way to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I, first and foremost, I would say
that that was absolutely positively
[SPEAKER_01]: untrue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it then, and I can, now I can
really point to you and say, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's been an extremely important,
um, program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still the only one like it in
the country and it's home to what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: a number of firsts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the first ever to do long-term
assessments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look at patients before they begin
using medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people have different types of
indications or conditions, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic pain, anxiety, or mood disruption,
sleep disruption, you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we look at them before they begin
using medical cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we followed them over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use any and all products they would
like to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have those products analyzed by an
outside lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know quote, what's in your wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's because it's not a clinical
trial and I'm not controlling what's given
[SPEAKER_01]: to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we can, of course, their exposure
to different cannabinoids over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is incredibly helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, we're looking at primary
outcomes like chronic pain, like mood,
[SPEAKER_01]: like sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, measures of cognitive
performance and thankfully measures of
[SPEAKER_01]: brain structure, function, quality of
life, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that again, some of these
firsts that mind, um, has, has sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: been fortunate enough to, to put on the
map, um, should be really just what I
[SPEAKER_01]: would call the beginning of the story,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, we're the first ever to look at
long-term outcome and cognitive
[SPEAKER_01]: performance and first ever to do imaging,
first to do some of these clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of which are informed by these
long-term observational studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell us the directions that we need
to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients have always been our greatest
source of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lead the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We follow them, which is a little
backwards in terms of medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not usual, but we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's been an incredibly rewarding
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think the program is
unbelievably, um, helpful and now has
[SPEAKER_01]: really expanded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, um, it's been, it's been a great
journey so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned there was a lack of
long-term studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are we talking?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the types of longitudinal
studies that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you look at the literature again,
we were, we were looking at legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Massachusetts in 2012,
and there was nothing in literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first studies were designed to look at
individuals up to one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I had a lot of people say,
good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll never stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, we have the opposite problem,
which is that once we begin looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: people over time and establish
relationships and people come in and we
[SPEAKER_01]: have these very comprehensive assessments,
they're interested in staying connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started off looking at outcome
between baseline and three months,
[SPEAKER_01]: six months, 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every month, um, our team contacts
them and we get an idea of what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using, how they're using frequency,
magnitude, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these in-depth assessments at the
milestone visits, then we went out to two
[SPEAKER_01]: years, then three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're following people all the way out
to five years, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
