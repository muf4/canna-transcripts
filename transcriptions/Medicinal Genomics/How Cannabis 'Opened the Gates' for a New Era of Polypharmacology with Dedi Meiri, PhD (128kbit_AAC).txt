[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the Can Made Coffee Talk
Lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaral, host of the
Can Made Coffee Talk podcast, and I am
[SPEAKER_01]: here with Deddy Mary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deddy, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to be here in person, no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this your first conference back since
the pandemic?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's my third in the last three
months, but it's for sure the first
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis conference and meeting all the
friends here, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I missed and it's an
amazing feeling face to face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you come to events like this,
what are you trying to get out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just catching up with colleagues or
trying to see what the latest innovations
[SPEAKER_01]: are?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the biggest takeaway for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it's a good opportunity to
sit and listen and learn and hear new
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second is the communication between
colleagues and people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we learned in the last two years that
it's far from being the same with Zooms or
[SPEAKER_00]: far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you finish the talk, you're asking
questions, and then you're getting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have another half an hour chat about
this and that and that, small talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is building the relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is building collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talked about the presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any in particular at this year's
CanMed that you're looking forward to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are a few that I'm a big fan
of them, you know, the regular ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also Stacey Gruber, which I really am
a big fan of her work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think she's going to present a few
new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't understand me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly the new science.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of talks in these types of
conference, which giving big view about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the endocannabinoids and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is enough for me already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the details and some of them I can
repeat the talk by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the new people, the people that really
showing new science and unpublished data,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is extremely interesting for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned Stacey Gruber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that there are others here at
CanMed that are presenting more clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trials, which I know is sort of the gold
standard in terms of data when looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, in the last, I would say,
three years, there is a lot of studying
[SPEAKER_00]: mature to be a real clinical trial and not
the kind of clinical trials that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking a few years ago that is more
observative trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that this effect and that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are real clinical trials,
double blind placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started also the pharma or,
you know, I will say the physician will
[SPEAKER_00]: admire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's opened the gate to new and population
and new types of patients that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to use and try when we cross this
barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's extremely important and
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so your presentation is titled The
Challenges in Bridging the Gap Between
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditional and Modern Medicine in the
Medicinal Cannabis Arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot to unpack there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, could you describe the
difference between traditional and modern
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what we just said about the
clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there is a difference between
using a herb and saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the Chinese believe that it's good
for that and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional is, you know, drinking a
babynag and say it's good for stomach
[SPEAKER_00]: aches or taking a chinitza or other
ginseng and say this is good for that and
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern medicine, it's proven facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, like you're doing clinical trials,
you know, what is the molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what the mechanism of action,
why it's doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the side effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the benefits and what are you
losing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always, you know, kind of a balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we call modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, in the last 100 years, most of the I
will call modern or pharma was single
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules to single targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants are never single molecules,
single target.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the pharma and the science and
physician was afraid about this complexity
[SPEAKER_00]: of molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happened in the last 20 years,
we call it polypharmacology, when more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one compound showing an effect,
combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happened in the last 20 years
is computer error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the past a lot of people have been
inspired in science today to look on
[SPEAKER_00]: network of, you know, few thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proteins, molecules, people doing
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that look to us already,
kind of trivial, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Networking of music, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What looks very complicated to look on
three molecules, what they are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: today?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an excel file right three
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a big bioinformatics this So
this is a huge change to look on
[SPEAKER_00]: complicate Action what we called in the
cannabis entourage effect, but what the
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is polypharmacology few molecules are
doing a complicate effect Today with the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability the science ability ability
analytical ability in computer
[SPEAKER_00]: bioinformatics it's not a Border anymore
we can cross it easily and this is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you know bridging the modern
Medicine with the traditional one Right,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's using modern tools to really be
able to find the benefits or the values
[SPEAKER_01]: That sort of the traditional medicines
were using where it was more kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: herbal based right in less single single
compound exactly think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional physician four thousand years
ago three thousand Years ago you come with
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't give you a pill with one
compounds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah He will give you a leaf with a road
with a root with a you know Another flower
[SPEAKER_00]: combine them together and giving you would
do what I called Polypharmacology will
[SPEAKER_00]: take actually few compounds from here free
compounds on from your few components from
[SPEAKER_00]: here He didn't really tank them,
but he combining them together and give
[SPEAKER_00]: you something complicated Maybe a lot of
that placebo, but a lot of that It's
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge that accumulate, you know,
we combine this and this and the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: died Okay, this is not good until he found
what is helping right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is thousands of years that
accumulating data that in the last 100
[SPEAKER_00]: years we put them aside Okay, this is too
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take the simplest one, but there are
many diseases neurodegenerative diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: like Alzheimer's ALS cancer diseases other
diseases that we are hitting our head to
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall for many years doesn't matter how
many billions of dollars we prune on that
[SPEAKER_00]: and we didn't find the compound the single
compound they're doing that right and I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that the next generation of of you
know where medicines will come from
[SPEAKER_00]: complicate and Medicines cannabis has
opened the gate for that in amazing way
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complicated plant with hundreds of
molecules that working in the synergism or
[SPEAKER_00]: in with a you know entourage effect with
the you know, a different a receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting different receptors and and it's
just open the window and the gate to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that plant medicinal plants are
like that and today we have the tools to
[SPEAKER_00]: To deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so cannabis brought money and the
concept to build labs like my own Detect
[SPEAKER_00]: Neon and but other labs that have the
ability today to take a plant To look
[SPEAKER_00]: doing what we call metabolomics to look on
all the active compounds to test them on
[SPEAKER_00]: different diseases to Analyze the
compounds to understand the mechanism of
[SPEAKER_00]: action Exactly what we did with cannabis
we can do with other plants There is a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: to do still with cannabis, but I think
it's bigger than cannabis It's open a
[SPEAKER_00]: window and gate to bridge the traditional
medicine with the yeah, so Are you saying
[SPEAKER_01]: there could be some opportunity to kind of
look at you know more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Established medicinal plants that maybe we
have gotten some of those single molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that have been effective Like
let's go back and look at other other
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds in here that we could have been
missing or that could have been Having
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of synergistic effect Yes,
that's what I'm doing for my you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what I'm doing back home Yeah,
so my lab is not working just on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are I have three PhD student that's
working on algae and other plants that we
[SPEAKER_00]: think are Important medicinal plants that
were too complicated and now we can break
[SPEAKER_00]: it down and understand Why it's working
and so on so cannabis is still very
[SPEAKER_00]: important You know, it's hitting the end
of cannabinoid system that it's all over
[SPEAKER_00]: our body and there is a lot to do and it's
a very unique a special plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for sure there are Many other plants
that we can benefit From the techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: and the knowledge that we learned from
cannabis to other plants interesting now
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the plants that's gotten a lot of
attention lately is Psychoactive mushrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: philosophy or other psilocybin producing
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you investigating that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure like part of my my lab and my
company is doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same idea for me, you know first
of all seven years ago people Said
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis THC and CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's the same thing as you said,
you know Psychedelic mushrooms or magic
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom psilocybin mushrooms What do you
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some mushrooms like to say THC
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one molecules So there are in my lab
only I have 135 different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin mushrooms 11 different families
of mushrooms every one of them Contained
[SPEAKER_00]: different combination of active compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of them psilocybin plus
psilocybin but there is We can recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 70 molecules from this family
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the combination is doing totally
different the fact They're hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: specific receptors like the cannabis is
hitting the endocannabinoid system They
[SPEAKER_00]: are hitting the serotonin aging system,
you know for each the 5-ht and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: family and so on and so on so it's the
same idea Is cannabis exactly we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea that it's Very powerfully work
on our body, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking two grams and you think
you're a dolphin, it's probably powerful,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: and and and I understand where these
Receptors are in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which a which Diseases I can aim and
and so on so on so we're we are very
[SPEAKER_00]: strong on that as well Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well Teddy Thanks again for taking the
time to be with us here in the coffee talk
[SPEAKER_01]: lounge looking forward to your
presentation Later in the event and thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you to our sponsor medicine women health
and the hemp coffee exchange for
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsoring the can make coffee talk lounge
