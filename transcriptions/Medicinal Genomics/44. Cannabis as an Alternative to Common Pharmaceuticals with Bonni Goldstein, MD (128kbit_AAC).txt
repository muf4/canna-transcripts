[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Can Med Coffee Talk
podcast, where we talk with the leading
[SPEAKER_01]: minds in cannabis science, medicine,
cultivation, and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_01]: puts on the Can Med Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy New Year, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope your 2022 is off to a good start
and that the year continues to bring joy
[SPEAKER_01]: and prosperity to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of 2022, Can Med 2022 is coming
up fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are less than 120 days away from making
our return to Pasadena, California for
[SPEAKER_01]: three full days of world-class cannabis
educational content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all starts on May 3rd with our full-day
medical practicum led by Dr. Bonnie
[SPEAKER_01]: Goldstein, Dr. Dustin Sulak, Dr. Kevin
Spellman, and Eloise Thiessen,
[SPEAKER_01]: NP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of them will share the latest medical
cannabis research, including information
[SPEAKER_01]: on dosing, drug interactions, and
different product types.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will also share the clinical
experience they have acquired treating
[SPEAKER_01]: patients with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This really is a must-attend event for any
healthcare professionals who are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in recommending medical
cannabis, but it's not limited to those
[SPEAKER_01]: folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone who is interested in learning more
about medical cannabis can and should join
[SPEAKER_01]: us for this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Head over to canmedevents.com to learn
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings us to May 4th and 5th,
the main event, Can Med 2022, two full
[SPEAKER_01]: days of oral presentations, panel
discussions, poster presentations,
[SPEAKER_01]: and industry exhibitors covering the
latest advancements in cannabis science,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, cultivation, and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are really excited about this year's
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be our best yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look at our keynote presenters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Dr. Ethan Russo presenting
cannabis and psychiatry, Dr. Seth Crawford
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about innovations in hemp
breeding, Grace Bandong will talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: building a comprehensive analytical
testing program, and Dr. Bonnie Goldstein
[SPEAKER_01]: will discuss cannabis medicine for
children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those presentations alone are worth the
price of admission, but please go to
[SPEAKER_01]: canmedevents.com to see the full schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want a preview of what you can
expect at Can Med 2020, too, check out the
[SPEAKER_01]: Can Med archive, which is a searchable
video library of all the past Can Med
[SPEAKER_01]: presentations and panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find that at canmedevents.com as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a link in the show
description, which brings us to this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode's guest, Dr. Bonnie Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you just heard, Bonnie is a Can Med
2022 keynote presenter and an instructor
[SPEAKER_01]: on the medical practicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Bonnie has presented at every Can
Med event, starting with our very first at
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvard Medical School in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a good reason for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie is one of the country's most
respected and experienced medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians, having treated thousands of
patients with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is the owner and medical director of
Canna Center's Wellness and Education.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is clinical advisor to Can Formatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she is the author of the book titled,
Cannabis is Medicine, How Medical Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in CBD Are Healing Everything from Anxiety
to Chronic Pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie and I discussed examples where
cannabis can replace traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical drugs to treat a variety of
conditions, including pain, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: depression, sleep problems, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie offers guidance for selecting the
right products for those conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as how to find the right dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also talked about a new paper that
Bonnie co-authored that investigates
[SPEAKER_01]: whether cannabis can be used to treat
patients with autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with Dr.
Bonnie Goldstein, I'd like to thank this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode's sponsor, Can Formatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can Formatics is an early stage
biotechnology startup focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: developing cannabis responsive biomarkers
as a universal tool for measuring
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis' and CBD's physiological impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can Formatics provides healthcare
professionals, patients, and medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis producer processors with the
tools and technology needed for developing
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence-based medical cannabis and CBD
treatments and products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can Formatics' mission is to develop
technologies that enable predictable and
[SPEAKER_01]: repeatable science-based medical cannabis
outcomes that improve health and quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of life.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You joined us way back on episode four of
the podcast where we talked about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine for pediatrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our most downloaded episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any listeners who maybe came later to
the podcast and haven't had a chance to go
[SPEAKER_01]: back and listen to that, I'll put a link
in the show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today, we're going to talk about a few
different examples where cannabis can be
[SPEAKER_01]: used to replace some medications you might
have in your own medicine cabinet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of these are over-the-counter
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others are prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nevertheless, Bonnie, you've
identified some common conditions where
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis may be a safer or more effective
option than traditional pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe a good place to start is with a
drug that I bet is in everyone's medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: cabinet, and that's NSAIDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your Aleve, your ibuprofen, Motrin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us why cannabis might be a good
substitute for these drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to add in, there are also
prescription NSAIDs like meloxicam and
[SPEAKER_00]: diclofenac.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always good for people to always,
anytime you get a prescription,
[SPEAKER_00]: go online, look up what kind of drug it
is, and read about the side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just doesn't mean you're going to have the
side effects, but it is good to read about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we know about NSAIDs, of course,
they're very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go for a run, and you know you're
going to pay for it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pop a couple of ibuprofen or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we don't really think about
them very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that NSAIDs can disrupt the GI
tract and cause stomach ache for some
[SPEAKER_00]: people, can aggravate heartburn for a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even now, because of that heartburn,
there's even now NSAIDs that come with
[SPEAKER_00]: antacids attached to them, so like a
two-in-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with antacids,
if you use those long-term, is you buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole new slew of problems, including
dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get kidney stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the main things that NSAIDs do
that's pretty severe is to cause stomach
[SPEAKER_00]: ulcers, which if you're not familiar with
what an ulcer is, it's basically a hole in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lining of your stomach or your
intestines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can even cause a perforation
meaning a hole all the way through,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I had an elderly patient years
and years ago who came to me and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time we met, he said that he
could no longer take NSAIDs because he had
[SPEAKER_00]: a perforated stomach ulcer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He fainted in the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got hauled off to the hospital,
and he had emergency surgery for a
[SPEAKER_00]: perforated stomach ulcer from taking
long-term NSAIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as rare as one would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there was a study back about 15
years ago that looked at chronic NSAID
[SPEAKER_00]: users, and 71% of people who were chronic
users, like daily, maybe a couple doses a
[SPEAKER_00]: day, had evidence of gut injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no joke there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other very important symptoms or side
effects you can get from NSAIDs too,
[SPEAKER_00]: which nobody really even seems to know
about, are strokes, heart attack,
[SPEAKER_00]: and increased risk of cardiovascular
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always tell people, you know,
your back hurts, and you want to take some
[SPEAKER_00]: ibuprofen, that's fine, or you have an
injury for a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But long-term, probably not the safest
medicine in terms of that, in terms of its
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing too, there's negative
effects on the kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of years ago, there was this
initiative called Choosing Wisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people listening want to Google it,
just Google Choosing Wisely initiative,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll see that what happened was this
group went to various specialists and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, give us the top five things that
primary care doctors are kind of missing
[SPEAKER_00]: out on, meaning they go to an orthopedic
surgeon and say, what's the top five
[SPEAKER_00]: things that maybe the primary care doctor
shouldn't be doing in the face of back
[SPEAKER_00]: pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, one of the things that kidney
doctors put on their list was,
[SPEAKER_00]: for people who have high blood pressure or
diabetes, not to use NSAIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you how many people I
know who have high blood pressure and or
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes and take NSAIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can damage your kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can negate your blood pressure
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, look, the FDA released a
black box warning on NSAIDs back in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not familiar with the black
box warning, it is an extra special
[SPEAKER_00]: warning saying, you know, buyer beware.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the FDA does that, that means
there is it's a serious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to just be very careful with,
you know, kind of chronic, heavy use of
[SPEAKER_00]: NSAIDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're talking about maybe
cannabis being a replacement here for
[SPEAKER_01]: NSAIDs, is it more for that use case
there, like for managing chronic pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or could cannabis actually be used to
relieve acute pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so the study support the use of
cannabis for chronic pain, but more so,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember, NSAIDs really target
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work on stopping a pro-inflammatory
compound called prostaglandin by blocking
[SPEAKER_00]: the enzymes that make prostaglandin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are called COX enzymes, COX.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're using NSAIDs,
you really are targeting inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, cannabis, all these compounds
in cannabis, right, CBD, CBG, CBDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, they're all potent
anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not even up for discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anymore, there's multiple studies that
clearly show anti-inflammatory effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when somebody comes with acute pain,
I have to be honest, the research doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: support the use of acute pain,
but I have patients who, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: will have surgery and they'll take opioids
for maybe two days after surgery and they
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to get off those opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that people stay and we're
going to talk about opioids, I hope,
[SPEAKER_00]: down the line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, studies show that if
you're on opioids for two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're likely to have some dependence,
and that's kind of gets to the slippery
[SPEAKER_00]: slope of dependence and addiction at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having cannabis on board helps with
that inflammation, and it does seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: help with acute pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a fair amount of patients tell me
that it helps with acute pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't disregard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that research has lagged behind
our clinical experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it would be helpful to be able to
do studies in humans, right, because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: still prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the answer from research is
still not there, but certainly clinically,
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so if there's someone listening now
who's maybe using NSAIDs somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly and maybe is a little alarmed
about some of the things that we talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about and is thinking about maybe trying
cannabis as a substitute, what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: products should they be looking for maybe
in terms of the cannabinoid profile or
[SPEAKER_01]: even just, you know, the route of
administration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because all of these compounds,
so CBD, THC, CBDA, THCA, CBG, CBC,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could go on and on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, the plant has over 140
different cannabinoids that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: described.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's what we call the main cannabinoids
and some minor cannabinoids there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those that have less than 0.3% by
weight THC are usually available online
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is buyer beware.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can really dial in your own
regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no one regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people like CBD and are low dose
responders.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who find low doses don't work
that well, escalate the dose and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find a cost effective dose that
can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I have found is that combination,
so CBD plus it's precursor, CBDA can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: very nice combination for inflammation
because they both are potent
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know about CBDA and THCA,
which are the more are the raw
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the compounds that come from
the fresh plant before they're heated up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to think you have to heat them to
activate them, but they actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: potent anti-inflammatory effects in the
raw form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that combination can work really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA plus THCA and of course THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is a potent anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kind of playing with each one to
see what works best.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a saying that people are probably
tired of hearing by this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: start low, go slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm gonna steal from Dr. Dustin Sulak,
one of my colleagues who says,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be afraid to go all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can push the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I have people just recently treated
someone one of my long time patients who
[SPEAKER_00]: uses cannabis for like wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's 89, 90 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in general pretty good shape,
takes cannabis in a tincture form,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he'd recently developed gout,
which if you're not familiar is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: painful condition where uric acid builds
up in your joint and just wreaks havoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had seen a number of doctors,
they all gave him medicines that he didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: wanna take that had a list of side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encouraged him to try CBDA at very
high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: He took 100 milligrams in the morning and
100 milligrams in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within about five days, his gout pain
was resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he called me to tell me, I can't
believe that this worked and it works so
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage people to try different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to go high on the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course THC, there's a much smaller
window for dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wanna kinda tip toe up a little
more slowly so you don't have an
[SPEAKER_00]: unpleasant experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of these can be helpful for
anti-inflammatory effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that people shouldn't be
afraid of is using blends because it
[SPEAKER_00]: appears that you can get away with lower
doses because these compounds work what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call the entourage effect or synergy and
they can enhance each other's benefits and
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize the risk of having to take much
higher doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recently talked with Dr. David
Meary, who I'm sure you know from the
[SPEAKER_01]: conference circuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was talking about how the
cannabinoids can work on similar receptors
[SPEAKER_01]: and sort of overlap and sort of compliment
each other with the whole entourage
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes perfect sense that using
sort of more of a whole plant extract that
[SPEAKER_01]: has a wider breadth of cannabinoids could
give a better result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a good segue here would be to
talk about opioids since you already
[SPEAKER_01]: touched on it and it also being a pain
reliever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a bit about opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does their use differ from folks who
are using NSAIDs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, how can cannabis be a good
substitute there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so they both fall under the
category of pain relievers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But NSAIDs are working more as an
anti-inflammatory by blocking production
[SPEAKER_00]: of pro-inflammatory compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And opioids work more by blocking,
actually working through the central
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous system, your brain and through
your spinal cord, by blocking the pain
[SPEAKER_00]: messages that the body is sending to the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now, interestingly enough,
opioids are anti-inflammatory in their
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some studies that show that,
but they're not really used for
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really used for those types of
pain that are considered difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: control type of pain, cancer pain,
post-surgical pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you read the research though,
we know that people are using opioids for
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term chronic pain relief,
but they don't really work that well for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's multiple studies have come out
and said, we got to find something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is a great option.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that, both cannabinoid receptors and
opioid receptors are kind of located
[SPEAKER_00]: anatomically close together in our brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting about that is that
they can influence each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so remember, opioids have the
dangerous side effect of blocking your
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to breathe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we call in the medical world,
respiratory depression, stops you from
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing if you take too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting about this kind of
combo of the receptors is that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: target each receptor, opioid receptor and
cannabinoid receptor, you can get,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, a kind of synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that opioid receptors and
cannabinoid receptors can influence each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of really interesting
research looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the science of it is very complex,
and we definitely need more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no question that people can
either replace opioids with cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: can add cannabis as an add-on and minimize
the escalation of their opioid use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, with opioid receptors,
you can develop dependence and tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to escalate your dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you start to get into
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some evidence to show that
cannabis kind of can, and I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: patients like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take three Vicodins a day,
morning, afternoon, and night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now 10 years in, they've never had to
change that dose, or even sometimes they
[SPEAKER_00]: can skip a dose because they've added in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted to quote some studies
so that people understand that this has
[SPEAKER_00]: been looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a 2016 survey of almost 1,500 cannabis
patients across 18 countries, 86% reported
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement in pain, and 25% substituted
cannabis for opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a survey, but how else do we measure
pain, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another survey from Israel looked at
elderly patients specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the older you get, the more likely
you are to have pain and chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at 901 elderly patients that
started medical cannabis, and 93.7%
[SPEAKER_00]: reported improvement in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost 24% of the population reported
a reduction in pain reduction from eight
[SPEAKER_00]: out of 10, down to four out of 10 on a
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost 20% were able to either discontinue
or reduce opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes older people if they're not
encouraged by their doctor to reduce,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just kind of stay on their medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one wonders if we pushed it a little
bit, we probably could get some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: people off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another survey that came out of
California last year, 180 patients with
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic low pain, About 50% were able to
stop opioids by using cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: remember it has to be you know You want
safe access legal access and you want lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of products to be available So,
you know, we're still fighting that battle
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit to be able but I think
cannabis for sure is a Strategy to help
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the opioid epidemic that we have in
this country That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you'll share links to those
surveys and studies Because we have a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: section in the show description With
additional links so people can easily look
[SPEAKER_01]: at I think that's that's great
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it sounds like cannabis is
really where its place here is Sort of in
[SPEAKER_01]: the long-term use of opioids again and not
so much like, you know The acute use like
[SPEAKER_00]: you were saying, you know a post-surgery
sure sure hundred percent for I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic pain is definitely The National
Academies of Science came out and said
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah chronic Pain in adults is absolutely
something that the evidence clearly shows
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits despite the poor Amount of
research that we have and you know in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of products and people ask how you
know, I'm using cannabis It doesn't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to be helping me There are studies that
show that CBD can help with pain and that
[SPEAKER_00]: THC can help with pain But the combination
is something that can be really beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had a lot of success with what I
call low ratio CBD to THC like a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one Or four to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means four parts CBD to one part
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that's a very nice Ratio to help
patients one because you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a whole heck of a lot because THC
plays a role But the four parts more of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD seems to dampen down some of the THC
unwanted effects maybe sure and I've even
[SPEAKER_00]: had look I have some teenagers in my
practice that have some really complex
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical conditions and four to one seems
to be that kind of sweet spot ratio that
[SPEAKER_00]: works for patients without The risk of
being impaired remember when I'm taking
[SPEAKER_00]: care of teenagers, I'm trying to get them
back to school Functioning learning,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they want to get their driver's
license You know These are people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling to kind of get their life off
the ground and pain is in the way whether
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a syndrome or they had an
accident or you know When I say a
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome, I have some patients that have
syndromes that are have you know pain as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it and That four to one ratio just
seems to be a real nice sweet spot for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of those patients And again,
they don't have to take big doses that
[SPEAKER_01]: synergy is there and can really help And
now is that typically taken in the form of
[SPEAKER_01]: a tincture or some sort of edible rather
than like a smokable flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Some of the adult patients,
I mean every now and then you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: Some flour that is that ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you can find high CBD flour and
THC flour You can blend you're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to hit on the four to one probably right
out of the gate I mean you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: eyeball it but I often tell people who are
using Flour whether they smoke it or vape
[SPEAKER_00]: it to blend their strains I mean you get
blend their products because you can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice effect In pediatric patients,
we use mostly tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know really of a four to one
edible that I can think of but in general
[SPEAKER_00]: Tincture allows for that now if you're
using tincture and you have separate CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: and THC you look at the label and do the
math to figure out what's You know four
[SPEAKER_00]: part what ends up being four part CBD and
one part THC so you can kind of recreate
[SPEAKER_00]: your own You don't have to find that
particular product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes that makes perfect sense
Okay, so moving out of the pain arena a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's shift to talking about anti-anxiety
or anti-depressant medication So first of
[SPEAKER_01]: all make maybe explain some of the the
drugs that are typically used to treat
[SPEAKER_01]: those conditions some of the negative
effects of that and then Why cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: might be a good substitute, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So SSRI selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, you know fancy words for
[SPEAKER_00]: basically saying it just lets your
serotonin hang around a little longer and
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's some other medications in a
similar category Called SNRI selective
[SPEAKER_00]: norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors And for
some people these can be very effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: but certainly Not everyone and often those
are the people that I see And also those
[SPEAKER_00]: are the people who are turned to cannabis
the side effects from these drugs again
[SPEAKER_00]: black box warnings on these drugs for
suicidal ideation And there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: question as to whether or not that caused,
you know a little bit Of kind of over fear
[SPEAKER_00]: when people are afraid But I kind of would
be afraid to take a drug that might make
[SPEAKER_00]: me want to kill myself if I'm already Kind
of depressed and anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's you know, it's fine a kind of a
funny way to treat people But some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side effects agitation loss of
appetite dizziness insomnia Stomach issues
[SPEAKER_00]: and a big one, especially with young
people, but certainly old people as well
[SPEAKER_00]: sexual dysfunction So, you know nobody it
certainly doesn't make You have less
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety and less depression if you can't
have an intimate relationship with with
[SPEAKER_00]: someone I mean that's just you know in
terms of quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So And again, there was a black box
warning And especially they say for
[SPEAKER_00]: younger people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you saw this There was an
article in the New York Times a few months
[SPEAKER_00]: ago Two physicians who kind of poo-pooed
the idea that you can't get off of these
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs They have something called the
discontinuation syndrome that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: described where like you can't just
abruptly stop a drug like Prozac or
[SPEAKER_00]: effects are one of these types of SSRIs
because they You have terrible side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects from removing it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they label it discontinuation
syndrome and they say oh, it's no big deal
[SPEAKER_00]: only 20% of patients But turns out these
two I think they were both psychiatrists
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrote an article to the New York
Times saying well we tried to get off and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really hard to get off these drugs So
we're sorry that we did that to have told
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody the wrong information So that's
the other thing is when you get started on
[SPEAKER_00]: something, let's just say you're going
through a phase a difficult time in your
[SPEAKER_00]: life, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you actually need this drug and now
when you don't need it anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes you six months to get off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that doesn't sound great to
me We don't see that with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly cannabis can substitute
There's significant research showing CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: is a potent anti-anxiety and of course the
problem with these drugs and with Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: too is that can take time to kick in
nothing's magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember you're asking These drugs to
change the neurotransmitters in your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to give it time I do find with
CBD that you know, often people are
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a placebo effect, but they feel
better Hey, who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm happy they feel better THC
as well really can work Very well for
[SPEAKER_00]: depression and anxiety dosing matters with
THC And with CBD as well some people who
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say take a low dose of CBD They take
I don't know 25 milligram little gummy and
[SPEAKER_00]: they do it every day for weeks and say I
just don't feel any better likely You're
[SPEAKER_00]: under dosing and again that goes back to
don't be afraid to go higher dose CBD has
[SPEAKER_00]: this really wide range of dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't absorb every milligram So I've
patients that respond at 10 milligrams and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got patients that need 400 a day
Okay, and that's kind of where THC comes
[SPEAKER_00]: in if you can't afford those very high
doses adding in a little bit of low dose
[SPEAKER_00]: THC to it can really make a difference and
Help minimize tolerance with THC help
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral minimize any impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again combination can be very nice
Yeah, no, that's good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh one last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna interrupt you one less thing CBG
Cannabigerol Yep, only on the market now
[SPEAKER_00]: for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of patients who report
terrific anti-anxiety with CBG Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was just gonna say that I mean with
THC I imagine you have to be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: cautious in terms of anxiety because I
know a lot of people have the opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of when they have a high dose of
THC where actually causes anxiety and I
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder if that has something to do with
the biphasic effects of THC that I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that Dr. Sulak and others have talked
about So just want to get your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_01]: that like is it again?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably best to start low and go
slow with something like THC Right and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's good to start low with the other ones
too If you're new to them, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: escalate a little bit more quickly with
THC You kind of you want to just go in
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller increments Somewhere between 1 and
2.5 milligrams for most people who are new
[SPEAKER_00]: to it You don't want to go and take 5
milligrams and then go to 20 that would
[SPEAKER_00]: not be the advice I usually recommend 2.5
milligrams for an adult and increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between 1 and 2.5 milligram
increments to find your sweet spot without
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Hitting up against what I call
that ceiling dose where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So The biphasic nature is very important
very important to understand biphasic
[SPEAKER_00]: means that these compounds can have
completely opposite effects at different
[SPEAKER_00]: doses So THC and the low dose can be very
anti-anxiety But if you take too much you
[SPEAKER_00]: can have anxiety and paranoia and you know
CBD has biphasic effects as well you the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD you can have Very alerting effects at
low dose and say oh, how do people use
[SPEAKER_00]: this for sleep?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel wide awake, but in much higher
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more sedating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Until you've explored what I call low
medium and high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't know what these compounds
do and so but one of the other things is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is a small percentage of the
population that just does in I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in like 20% in Caucasian lower and other
races that are That people cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolize THC very well And so you may
fall into that category if just THC does
[SPEAKER_00]: just not sit well with you And again,
you don't have to use THC you can manage
[SPEAKER_00]: with CBG CBD Even I find THC a can help
there's a very tiny amount of THC in there
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably doing something it is
hitting your reset your cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors, but I find especially in my
Autism population THC a works beautifully
[SPEAKER_00]: for reducing anxiety in this in this
particular group Yeah, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to note that with with all of
these conditions that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: there is an element of Experimentation
that goes with with using cannabis right
[SPEAKER_01]: really trying to figure out what products
gonna work for you, but dosage Maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: timing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna ask you about that Especially
if you're taking an edible or a tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about taking?
[SPEAKER_01]: With food or the beginning of the day
versus the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's sort of the best?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great advice for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're taking cannabis under your
tongue sublingually or Edibles or taking
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a drink with cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely want to take with food The
studies are kind of clear on this that you
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely absorb more when you take with
food Especially food that contains fat so
[SPEAKER_00]: they did this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think last year the year before where
they showed that they gave volunteers
[SPEAKER_00]: little THC capsules and They did it on a
fat what they call a fasting state and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they did it with what they called an
American breakfast So what do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that was?
[SPEAKER_00]: loaded with eggs Bacon hash browns cooked
in oil, you know lots of fat and it turns
[SPEAKER_00]: out that when they check levels in the
bloodstream those those who took the the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC capsules with a Fatty meal or a meal
with high fat content had higher levels
[SPEAKER_00]: and a longer exposure Interestingly in
their study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found it delayed the onset For the
cannabis to kick in but then there was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a longer and more substantial
absorption and Evidence in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's number one doesn't mean you
can't take it on an empty stomach You can
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just saying you're absorbing more
When you take it with food that has high
[SPEAKER_00]: fat content remember A lot of the
tinctures have oil base, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So either either an olive oil or MCT or
coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fats already there Okay in terms of
timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great question So, you know in my
book and also when I counsel patients I
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of talk about first you want to find
the dose and So starting low dose and
[SPEAKER_00]: titrating up when you're not going
anywhere Don't do it on a you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't start something new when you're
starting, you know You have to be at a
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting or something you this is When you
know your time off so you can really take
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to assess how you feel If you
feel better with your cannabis pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to how long did it take to kick
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did the effects last right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did it wear off?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did it take for the next dose to
kick in because all of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Information is going to be somewhat
individual because some people absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: better and quicker some people metabolize
slower or faster so You know for instance
[SPEAKER_00]: for me, I know if I take a tincture It
takes about an hour and a half to kick in
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know people who say it kicks in in
30 minutes Well, that's gonna if I know
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say I'm having chronic pain And I
know it's gonna take an hour and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: for it to kick in I am NOT gonna wait for
it to wear off So then I'm going up and
[SPEAKER_00]: down with my pain spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna know gee I know it so last time
I took it it lasted five hours So at the
[SPEAKER_00]: four hour mark, I'm probably gonna redose
or the three and a half hour mark so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good to pay attention and Oftentimes,
it's hard to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do encourage people to journal or you
know, there's websites there's apps that
[SPEAKER_00]: have this but you can also just get a
notebook and just Document took this dose
[SPEAKER_00]: at this time Felt this and this is how
long it lasted and that helps you figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out your timing because there it's not
like we know for instance Like ibuprofen
[SPEAKER_00]: you can take every six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what kind of the drug companies
have figured out through Extensive
[SPEAKER_00]: research and so on but your
endocannabinoid system is unique to you
[SPEAKER_00]: It's controlled by your DNA and it's
influenced by lots of different things in
[SPEAKER_00]: your life And so how you respond to
cannabis we have to treat it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: customized medicine or you're just not
gonna find You know what's gonna work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great advice and yeah,
it goes back to that whole point there
[SPEAKER_01]: there is this element of customization or
experimentation that just sort of comes
[SPEAKER_01]: with the territory but very much worth it
and When you can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I say what what you know,
the price you pay is less side effects
[SPEAKER_00]: Right and a chance to use natural medicine
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I want to move along here
because I don't want to be very mindful of
[SPEAKER_01]: your time Something you touched on was
sleeping and I know that cannabis can be
[SPEAKER_01]: very useful for that as well but I do want
to I want to say that I personally
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes find the opposite problem And
you kind of touched on that too with with
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD Sometimes I find if I have too much
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wide awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So What am I doing wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clearly dosing if you're using THC,
it's dosing So the first thing I often
[SPEAKER_00]: tell people is that in my experience the
best compound for sleep Even though
[SPEAKER_00]: there's lots of people out there that may
disagree is THC it helps with sleep now in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry people call it Indica strains
really when you're talking it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: misuse or you know misnomer but really
what you're looking at is you want THC in
[SPEAKER_00]: a day and you want the terpenes which we
really touch on but the terpene myrcine
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is a Terpene known to kind of
boost the sedative effect of THC So when
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a combo of THC with a significant
amount of myrcine you can get a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: sedating effect in addition You can get
linalool in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linalool is just another terpene found
It's cross species with lavender and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very calming and relaxing and often if we
can alleviate Anxiety people can fall
[SPEAKER_00]: asleep because many of us were tired But
the brain won't turn off because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about this and that the other
thing so I do find that THC plus myrcine
[SPEAKER_00]: and linalool is kind of like the first
thing that people should try There's this
[SPEAKER_00]: myth that CBD helps with sleep and it can
and But it appears to be in higher doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, there was a study which I'll
be happy to give you the the reference for
[SPEAKER_00]: that looked at CBD for Sleep and anxiety
and they found that Most of the people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the study did get relief of their anxiety
and that sustained over time Initially
[SPEAKER_00]: people did find some benefit with sleep,
but they lost that effect over time And
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so interesting But part of that is
because I just think you know at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point your body kind of accommodates to
the effect of CBD Remember, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting the receptor directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works differently and maybe you
accommodate to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just doesn't Help those and remember
why did it help with anxiety?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know it to be a good anti-anxiety
And again dosing wise they didn't go super
[SPEAKER_00]: sky-high dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not getting that sedating effect
one thing To say in terms I mentioned some
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios earlier when we're talking about
pain I do find that for some people a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one ratio for CBD and THC works
very well and can help People who when
[SPEAKER_00]: they take THC and you say, you know,
it keeps me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I doing wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be that it's just a little too much
THC effect and you may get I call it It's
[SPEAKER_00]: a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say I you're like getting too thinky You
just start thinking and you go off on all
[SPEAKER_00]: these tangents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard so many people Say that I've
experienced it myself, but it's a I Feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like that one to rate one ratio allows the
CB the THC to do its thing and the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of keeps it in check From letting you
go too far with the THC but dosing matters
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you take just a little bit extra
THC sometimes that can actually make you
[SPEAKER_00]: stay awake a little bit more and like I
said some people are super sensitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you can't metabolize THC so
dosing matters And if you feel like oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took five milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't seem very high and it's
keeping me up Well take half of it or even
[SPEAKER_00]: you know half of that again You may find
that a little bit now The other thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: for some people they're able to take
cannabis and then go right to bed Like
[SPEAKER_00]: take it and go lay down with if they
inhale Other people tell me they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: take it Relax for a few hours and then
they feel like they can go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that goes back to timing Pay attention
to your timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it right before bedtime Try it a few
hours before bedtime because for some
[SPEAKER_00]: people two or three hours in is when they
feel that fight that kind of full
[SPEAKER_00]: relaxation They feel like the anxiety is
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe their pain is down and they're able
to then turn off their brain and go to
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep Yeah, no that description of being
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Yeah, I've definitely been there
and I wonder too because you said that
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes CBD can be used to sort of
counteract those effects if you Had say a
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD vape or flower or something when you
kind of have that feeling happening Could
[SPEAKER_01]: you use that and they could sort of help
balance you out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, you certainly could try that there's
no question that people do that Sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: if they feel that they got they took too
much THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They try to counteract it with CBD They
work a little bit opposite of each other
[SPEAKER_00]: In their mechanism of action, so sometimes
you know that can work out one other thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I could mention Is that for CBN so
cannabinol?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of CBN on the market now CBN
is the breakdown product of THC So right
[SPEAKER_00]: THC ages or THC aages what you end up
having is CBN just cannabinol Years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody kind of posted somewhere that it
helps asleep and then kind of took off and
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say clinically I just haven't
seen great results here and there I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen a patient who says Oh, yeah,
it helps with sleep or When I combine it
[SPEAKER_00]: with THC, I get better sleep But I just
haven't been that impressed with it If you
[SPEAKER_00]: read the research on it the and again
limited research much of it old there's
[SPEAKER_00]: just really no evidence whatsoever that it
seems to promote a Sedating experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want people to there's it may
not be anything wrong with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be getting misinformation in You
know when you're product where they say
[SPEAKER_00]: it's for CBN for sleep There's really no
true scientific evidence that That is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it really does promote sleep and I have to
say that when you look in the research
[SPEAKER_00]: there are so little about sleep as a
primary effect in terms of human clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, I mean or clinical trials,
it's just It's usually a secondary thing
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're studying pain and then you ask
people secondary Symptoms, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is your anxiety better is your pain
better, you know interpersonal
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships all that kind of stuff But
it's really interesting that here we are
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2021 This plants been around forever
California's had, you know almost 26 years
[SPEAKER_00]: of medical cannabis and I still can't
quote studies on cannabis for sleep
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're just really aren't any
Yeah No, and I guess that makes sense if
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're using cannabis to treat your
pain or your anxiety and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're having Less pain and less anxiety
you're feeling better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna sleep better, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess oh, there's no question that
that's a component of it and and It seems
[SPEAKER_00]: that When you really look at some of the
data that's out there in terms of surveys
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on that is what people are
reporting Is that my I feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: My back is not hurting, you know,
my joints aren't hurting I don't have this
[SPEAKER_00]: throbbing and remember too that if you're
busy during the day, you're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention When you lay down at
night is when you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my back is killing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right So it would be nice to be able
to control the pain and also all the
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety that we're all been living with
regular anxiety and then added anxiety the
[SPEAKER_00]: last number of years and To be able to
eliminate that just allows you to to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: off at night and you need to sleep You
need that that restorative Sleeper you
[SPEAKER_00]: just not gonna function great the next day
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right Moving on to to the last Drug
that you had mentioned here for that we
[SPEAKER_01]: could use cannabis to substitute alcohol
So again, I mean, I guess we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about sort of using it alcohol as a way to
unwind or decompress after the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day Why do you think cannabis might be a
better option?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and so let's just talk about
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no like Equivalent to an
endocannabinoid system in our body for
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a target It does stuff to
us, but it doesn't have a target system
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the cause of many medical conditions
including causing it's a direct cause of
[SPEAKER_00]: like seven cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes cirrhosis of liver I'm not
trying to talk anybody out of drinking but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not my favorite thing when you're
when you go through medical training You
[SPEAKER_00]: really do see a lot of hideousness from
alcohol, you know chronic pancreatitis
[SPEAKER_00]: DUIs domestic violence all kinds of crazy
stuff and then you know experts have
[SPEAKER_00]: reported that there's no real safe amount
of alcohol, but why do people turn to It
[SPEAKER_00]: and exactly what you said it's legal Right
and it's easily accessed and it can numb
[SPEAKER_00]: you and when you ask people who are
Abusing alcohol while they're using it
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you it helps with their do
they feel at least initially it help with
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety depression and pain those are the
main reasons that people use alcohol and
[SPEAKER_00]: so and I think too we can lump in PTSD in
there as well because I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people do turn to alcohol anyway,
I Want to point out a great article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this article was written back in 2004
By a doctor by the name of dr. Todd
[SPEAKER_00]: McCarrie and if you don't know dr. Todd
McCarrie So he was one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors in California who after the law
was passed in 1996 Who was willing to put
[SPEAKER_00]: his license on the line and treat
patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a psychiatrist with a very long
esteemed career He understood cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: he wanted to help people with it And so he
wrote an article published in 2004 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: article title is cannabis as a substitute
for alcohol So it's a wonderful article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really encourage people to read it You
go to Google Scholar put in cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: substitute for alcohol and you can write
dr. Todd and you'll find it so he
[SPEAKER_00]: documented 92 patients that he
successfully treated who were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: substitute cannabis become quote sober off
of alcohol And you know from a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call harm reduction,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have cirrhosis of the liver with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see You know cannabis causing
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see cannabis causing
cardiovascular disease or chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: pancreatitis or You know people beating up
their family members from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's a harm reduction approach
that he took But I just want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: something that just really stood out to me
and I reread the article in preparation to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk with you and He made this very
interesting observation that the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize that alcohol was damaging them
physically and emotionally and That
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis was doing the opposite was making
them feel both physically and emotionally
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you think about that you're gonna
put a substance in your body It should
[SPEAKER_00]: make you it may even if it's a brief
happiness from let's say getting drunk
[SPEAKER_00]: Long-term what ends up happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to meet an alcoholic who?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they don't want to go through
the detox, but if they could quit they
[SPEAKER_00]: would quit on a dime But it's not that
easy and it appears that cannabis can help
[SPEAKER_00]: people So what he did was he encouraged
people who had cravings for alcohol every
[SPEAKER_00]: time they had a craving to use their
cannabis and eventually what happened was
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of shifted over from alcohol use
to cannabis use and so You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I I think certainly when you look at the
costs to society of alcohol And cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean very low cost with cannabis,
especially since they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully stop arresting people for it But
in terms of medical certainly alcohol is a
[SPEAKER_00]: much larger cost to society and And and
the question becomes is why why does it
[SPEAKER_00]: work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because it is treating these
underlying conditions that you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to use alcohol for and so again,
I just really encourage you to read the
[SPEAKER_00]: article all those people listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great article he just makes a lot
of really interesting points and Even goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into the history Cannabis was being used
to treat the DT's delirium tremens,
[SPEAKER_00]: which comes from withdrawal from alcohol
back in the 1880s How do we ignore that in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Now we have some science And it's a
great point that you make that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis can help with some of these
underlying conditions that folks are
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering from to turn to alcohol for sort
of the That numbing effect, but instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, replacing one numbing effect for
another they're actually Improving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and he writes this little part about
it where you just get blotto and it
[SPEAKER_00]: disinhibits you and you kind of go off the
deep end with alcohol, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just have this kind of
outburst where cannabis makes you
[SPEAKER_00]: contemplative helps you look inside maybe
gives you some perspective on you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that you're struggling to deal
with and It's just a complete You can't
[SPEAKER_00]: compare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not equal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you don't have it an alcohol system
in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a target We make cannabis like
compounds in our body for a reason it's
[SPEAKER_00]: helped to balance us to keep us in
homeostasis And all you're doing when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're taking cannabis is augmenting that
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that with alcohol So it's
just important for people to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: because for all these years You know law
enforcement everybody else wants us to
[SPEAKER_00]: lump them together as drugs of abuse And
I'm sorry cannabis can be abused but
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly cannabis is medicine alcohol is
not Absolutely, that's a great point and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're right about cannabis being very
contemplative when I when I'm having those
[SPEAKER_01]: Experiences where I'm too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanky in laying in bed awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely auditing myself in I Have a
nice to-do list the next morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a chance to kind of step back
And for a lot of people they'll say to me
[SPEAKER_00]: it removes the emotion so I can actually
make a decision without being so
[SPEAKER_00]: emotionally engaged Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is great for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so Thank you Bonnie for all of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I let you go I do want to talk
about the new publication that you were
[SPEAKER_01]: recently a co-author on that was
investigating using cannabinoids to treat
[SPEAKER_01]: children with autism spectrum disorder,
so tell us a bit about that and tell us Is
[SPEAKER_01]: this going to be part of your can med 2022
presentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I will include it in my can med
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I joined forces with a company called
Can from addicts and their websites camp
[SPEAKER_00]: from addicts calm if you're interested in
looking at their what they do But
[SPEAKER_00]: basically they measure what's called
cannabis responsive biomarkers from your
[SPEAKER_00]: saliva Which can determine your Response
to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in the early stages of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still doing research, but it's been
about three years of R&D and So,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me explain, you know the the research
real quick and then you can kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm talking about so I have many
patients in my practice with autism and we
[SPEAKER_00]: selected out a handful of them who were
already on a Regiment of cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: seemed to be helping them for at least a
year Okay, so we've established that these
[SPEAKER_00]: are patients who respond To medical
cannabis and what we did was, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: going through a rigid scientific method we
recruited them plus So they're about 15
[SPEAKER_00]: children with autism and then we recruited
nine Children what we call typically
[SPEAKER_00]: developing so no autism no epilepsy that
kind of thing and what we did was we
[SPEAKER_00]: collected saliva from all of them and in
the group with autism we collected the
[SPEAKER_00]: saliva before they got their morning dose
of their cannabis medicine and just be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware they were all on Different
customized regimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not on the same Product or the
same regimen some on CBD some on THC some
[SPEAKER_00]: on THC a so a lot of different regimens
and Then what we did with the children
[SPEAKER_00]: with autism is after they got their
morning dose We waited to what we called
[SPEAKER_00]: the peak effect when most parents felt was
about an hour and a half after they got
[SPEAKER_00]: their morning dose and we collected saliva
again and then we looked at the biomarkers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the from The morning, you know
comparing the pre cannabis dose biomarkers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the post and what do you mean
biomarkers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So These are compounds that reflect
chemical pathways in your body So for
[SPEAKER_00]: instance something that people might
understand is a typical biomarker in men
[SPEAKER_00]: is PSA They get a PSA test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks for prostate cancer Okay,
so when you go get your blood work,
[SPEAKER_00]: they draw your PSA and if it's elevated,
you know They start the work up to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have prostate cancer and then let's
say you do have prostate cancer They
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the PSA level over time to see are
you responding to treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it shoot up reflecting and that the
cancers active again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So biomarkers are already being used in
science, you know quite a bit and for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of things including, you know
inflammatory conditions and cancer and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on so This group of what we call cannabis
responsive biomarkers We're already kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of shown before our study to respond to
cannabis and so a handful of them that we
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at for children with autism one's
called NAA and Acetyl Aspartate and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection of kind of neuronal brain
dysfunction and inflammation We looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: something called spermine which measures
kind of pain response cortisol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which measures stress response Glutamine
which is a neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, what we found was that in all
these Children in the study that once they
[SPEAKER_00]: took their medical cannabis That there and
by the way the typically developing
[SPEAKER_00]: children when we collected their saliva
that kind of established what we call the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologic range Okay, so between two
certain data points with a mean tells us
[SPEAKER_00]: okay within here is kind of what we're
looking for To see if it corrects to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a major shift in the biomarkers of
the children with autism towards this
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologic Range of the typically
developing children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is clear-cut objective data
showing that Medical cannabis in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular cohort was correcting This kind
of abnormal chemical pathway biomarkers
[SPEAKER_00]: What we also saw was that each child's,
you know biomarker Pattern let's say was
[SPEAKER_00]: very different and so It's just there's so
many people out there saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need proof that it works, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is some objective data I take
a parent's word for it if a parent tells
[SPEAKER_00]: me my child stopped You know putting their
hand through the wall and stop
[SPEAKER_00]: self-injurious behavior and is sleeping
through the night You know, look I very
[SPEAKER_00]: close relationship with my family's I know
when things are going well because they
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you but when it's not going well They
tell you to but for those out there who
[SPEAKER_00]: want a little more proof This is objective
data showing that we can correct some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the abnormal chemical pathways by using
Cannabis and remember and we just talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about this anti-inflammatory helps with
pain helps with stress All these
[SPEAKER_00]: biomarkers were completely off the charts
at some of these kids and they corrected
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very exciting to be able to show
this in an objective way And so I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely be talking about it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our first paper we got so many
data points that we have a Second paper
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So And somebody might ask well to what end
and so the way I look at this is that
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially down the line This would help
me optimize treatment for patients so I
[SPEAKER_00]: could get a baseline before we get started
Maybe three months in measure this and
[SPEAKER_00]: again, it's saliva.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not invasive a parent could collect
the saliva at home nail it in and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: could measure to see what biomarkers are
improving is Information down enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to add in maybe CBDA to help
with more information?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that kind of thing So we're not
there just yet But that is my hope that
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll have some objective data the same
way we use lab data now To try to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: make clinical decisions Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's really encouraging and
now I'm curious we were talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: different biomarkers and how after the
cannabis treatment it kind of got more to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Sort of the baseline mean that you
were looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious was the cannabis Increasing
the levels of those biomarkers decreasing
[SPEAKER_01]: or combination of both since we know that
you know, yeah You know, the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system is sort of a
regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious if you saw Both effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we did and that's so amazing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when when the chemical was low it
seemed to boost it Back to the mean or
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the physiologic range and if it
was high it brought it down again going
[SPEAKER_00]: back to that idea of homeostasis balancing
and that's one of the most exciting things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I saw because you know You read all
these articles and we've we've got all
[SPEAKER_00]: these brilliant Scientific minds that have
written papers and I read it all and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, it's all about homeostasis in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know I'm gonna challenge that
Theory, how do we know that's what it
[SPEAKER_00]: does?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we you know and here in this
research?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that we can see it, you know,
for instance, let's say a biomarker was
[SPEAKER_00]: like minus Five a standard deviations
below the mean it would bring it up or if
[SPEAKER_00]: it was plus 40 It would bring it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go getting right back to that
You know, and it didn't bring everything
[SPEAKER_00]: into alignment like by no means but
certainly the overall Results that we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly show that these compounds are are
homeostatic and Helping patients achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: that and you know, someone might say well
these are kids Who are already doing well
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on but remember to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're biomarkers before they got their
medical cannabis dose and we had we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have them take the cannabis You know,
we had like at least an eight-hour washout
[SPEAKER_00]: beforehand Which we know that you'll
metabolize a lot of that out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: system by then that they were kind of
starting from scratch in the morning
[SPEAKER_00]: before they got their dose so And of
course, you know, it would be nice to
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat the studies the next study that
we're going to try to look at is how
[SPEAKER_00]: biomarkers for a neuropathic pain to See
if there's a improvement in that and if
[SPEAKER_00]: so, you know, how does that work and so
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's a lot of exciting
Value here and utility with this with type
[SPEAKER_00]: of objective Measurement Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean we need we need more data So
thank you so much for contributing that
[SPEAKER_01]: and we look forward to hearing more about
it at Canmet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So All right, Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely kept you over the time that I
I promised I would keep you so thanks so
[SPEAKER_01]: much for For doing this is some great
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are gonna get a
lot of benefit out of this Before I let
[SPEAKER_01]: you go, please do share any Social media
or websites or any ways that people can
[SPEAKER_01]: stay in touch with you and keep up with
everything that you're working on so my
[SPEAKER_00]: website is canna centers comm and on
social media Bonnie Goldstein MD that's on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and then linkedin I think is
under Bonnie Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do much on Twitter So it's mostly
Instagram where I try to post some you
[SPEAKER_00]: know informative things But also the name
of the article if anybody's interested and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely send you the link Cannabis
responsive biomarkers a
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacometabolomics based application to
evaluate the impact of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment on Children with autism spectrum
disorder and again, it was published last
[SPEAKER_00]: week And then also look for the paper
coming down the line in the next few
[SPEAKER_01]: months Thanks again Bonnie And I can't
wait to see you out in Pasadena for Canmet
[SPEAKER_00]: looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we'll we'll get there Sounds
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Hope you enjoyed my conversation with
dr. Bonnie Goldstein check out the link In
[SPEAKER_01]: the show description to learn more about
the topics to be discussed and thanks
