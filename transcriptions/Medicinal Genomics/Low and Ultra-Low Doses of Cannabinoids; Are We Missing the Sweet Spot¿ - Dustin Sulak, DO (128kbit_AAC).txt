[SPEAKER_00]: good morning everyone thank you for being
here so early and thank you to can med for
[SPEAKER_00]: inviting me and to all the sponsors this
is the best cannabis conference that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been to in a long time and more and more
it's feeling like a family of people
[SPEAKER_00]: working together in a common mission and
and it's just beautiful so I'm so thankful
[SPEAKER_00]: this morning last night I was talking with
my friend Nicole who thanked me for always
[SPEAKER_00]: making her feel like she doesn't know
anything after my presentations and my
[SPEAKER_00]: response was well actually I have a whole
presentation about that tomorrow I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never actually designed my presentations
to do that before but apparently that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the intention today so I want to show you
something that I've been thinking a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about over the last 13 years of clinical
practice based on observations I've had in
[SPEAKER_00]: my patients and things that I've found in
the primary literature and how we can tie
[SPEAKER_00]: that all together to have a better and
deeper understanding of the potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis we know that there's a huge
untapped potential in this plant and we
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't know exactly where to look so
I'm going to point you in a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: direction and to do that we might need to
zoom in a little bit we have a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: flower from my backyard this first picture
and then as we zoom in it starts to look a
[SPEAKER_00]: little different a little like a fantasy
world and as we get even closer it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: to look a little bit like an alien
landscape and this is where I want to take
[SPEAKER_00]: you today suddenly we went from cannabis
land to mushroom land but but when you
[SPEAKER_00]: when you zoom in like this and you get a
deeper understanding of what's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in one small part of the cannabis world
then I think we can zoom out again with a
[SPEAKER_00]: better appreciation for the whole so
whenever we zoom in during this
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation today let's stick with the
whole as well we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: some cannabis dosing trends hormesis and
its role in medicine might be a new term
[SPEAKER_00]: for some of you preclinical evidence for
low and ultra low dosing we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the potential mechanisms of action
and then I'll bring the rubber to the road
[SPEAKER_00]: for some recommendations for researchers
producers and patients a lot of you have
[SPEAKER_00]: heard this phrase the dose makes the
poison which is a paraphrase of a quote
[SPEAKER_00]: from Paracelsus who lived in the fourteen
and fifteen hundreds all things are poison
[SPEAKER_00]: and nothing is without poison only the
dose allows something to not be poison and
[SPEAKER_00]: for the AV guys in the back thank you for
doing such a good job could you make my
[SPEAKER_00]: next slide a little bigger I don't have
notes on the PowerPoint so I don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: that big thing there so when we overdose
on THC we tend to see paradoxical effects
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at the list of symptoms that can
occur with an overdose you'll see almost
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that cannabis could cure or
treat at an appropriate dose nausea
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting diarrhea all these GI complaints
anxiety and paranoia it can cause headache
[SPEAKER_00]: myoclonus hyperkinesis like needing to
move around and twitching and confusion
[SPEAKER_00]: and even psychosis now this most commonly
occurs when somebody eats a delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: looking treat that has an appetite
stimulant in it that makes them want to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat more or when the poor patient receives
a tube of dark stuff from one of their
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that really wants to help and
tells them to start with a half grain of
[SPEAKER_00]: rice and they wake up in the middle of the
night in a acute psychosis not fun and
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry guys in the back I don't know if I
you know misspoke but now I've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing on both sides I'd love to have
one of what I'm talking about and one of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's coming next if you can swing that
so if you look in my clinical practice at
[SPEAKER_00]: the oral dosing range that's been
effective and this includes some outliers
[SPEAKER_00]: we could go all the way down to point zero
one milligrams of cannabinoids per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram of body weight of the patient per
day all the way up to a hundred milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: per kilogram so here we have like a ten
thousand fold dosing range which is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual and like I said there's some
outliers but you I've seen people I start
[SPEAKER_00]: them at one milligram of maybe THC before
bed and they sleep well and they never
[SPEAKER_00]: have to titrate after that and then we
published a case last year of a woman that
[SPEAKER_00]: was taking around seven thousand
milligrams of total cannabinoids daily
[SPEAKER_00]: with breast cancer and she did really well
with that even these huge doses are far
[SPEAKER_00]: from the toxic doses in primates monkeys
were treated with 9,000 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram of THC and they survived that
even though I'm sure they did not enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: that and now within this huge broad dosing
range we have nonlinear dose response
[SPEAKER_00]: effects which means as you start at a low
dose and titrate up people will start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting better and better results until
you go past some threshold and beyond that
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient starts building tolerance and
losing efficacy so these are nonlinear
[SPEAKER_00]: dose response effects and they show up all
over the preclinical literature of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis here's an example of locomotor
activity in rats and as you can see let's
[SPEAKER_00]: see if I can get my my laser to work here
is it up there it's a little dim but as
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see if you go at a low dose point
two milligrams per kilogram of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: locomotor activity decreases so these rats
aren't running around as much as you
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the dose of THC the locomotor
activity increases above the baseline and
[SPEAKER_00]: then as you increase it even more it goes
back down again this is not unusual with
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabinoids not unusual when
interfacing with a homeostatic regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: system and it shows up all over the place
not just in rats but also in humans and
[SPEAKER_00]: not just with THC but also with CBD here's
an example of a study in humans that was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at purified CBD for treating
anxiety and they tested that with a public
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking challenge and you can see here
that 300 milligrams of CBD reduced anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 did not and 900 did not there's a
sweet spot in there and what about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: doses that they didn't test in this study
what else are we missing that's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: want you to keep asking where are my blind
spots and what else am I missing that 300
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of CBD could outperform
clonazepam and 900 do nothing now
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the years of my clinical
practice we've had experience with this
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met a lot of people that were down
here in the red circle and I taught them
[SPEAKER_00]: how to get back up here to their optimal
dose a dose at which people do not have
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance they've maintained efficacy for
years or decades and they have less side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects and better efficacy so we have had
this experience of reducing the dose of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and getting better results what
might be going on down here that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know about so this is something that's
been interesting me and there's a there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a concept in biology that the term was
coined in 1943 it's called hormesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's derived from the Greek term to excite
it describes a dose response phenomenon in
[SPEAKER_00]: which a low dose will stimulate and a high
dose can inhibit and it was discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: using the fungicidal extract of the red
cedar tree and the researchers mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: on this page they they looked at
concentrations of this antifungal and
[SPEAKER_00]: tested against numerous fungal species and
they noticed that at higher concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: it was an antifungal it killed the fungus
but if you diluted it enough it would make
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungus grow faster why would an
antifungal at a low concentration increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate of growth anybody got an idea I
mean it put your hand up if you've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea sure nobody all right oh yeah Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly so he said we have mechanisms that
are designed to detoxify and when you use
[SPEAKER_00]: those well so how I would frame this is
that when we challenge the cell with an a
[SPEAKER_00]: toxin at a concentration that's not high
enough to kill it but is high enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn on those cellular defense and repair
mechanisms then we get a net benefit right
[SPEAKER_00]: we we nudge the health of that cell just
enough that it's upregulated and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of you are familiar with this
concept right the best example in your
[SPEAKER_00]: lives hopefully is exercise if you
exercise too much you're gonna hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself but if you exercise the right
amount you're providing a stress to your
[SPEAKER_00]: system that allows it to get stronger so
this is like the what doesn't kill me
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me stronger and one way in which we
respond to exercise is through the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system here you can see
more than a doubling of anonimide levels
[SPEAKER_00]: after 30 minutes of running on a treadmill
singers get this from singing as well so
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at some of the other things in our
lives you a lot of you may have heard
[SPEAKER_00]: about resveratrol this is a compound in
foods that is believed to have helped the
[SPEAKER_00]: French prevent heart disease by drinking
wine I'm not sure it works like that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is an antioxidant and if you look at the
potential benefits you'll see that it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of looks like cannabis anti-cancer
anti-aging neuroprotection anti-diabetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cardio protective and so forth here's a
molecule that does all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: things and even though it's an antioxidant
the quantities of resveratrol that we
[SPEAKER_00]: consume aren't going to provide or act
values that have all of those effects in
[SPEAKER_00]: our body so what's resveratrol doing it's
actually up regulating our endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidant and repair mechanisms so you
could think of it almost like a toxin
[SPEAKER_00]: that's making us stronger resveratrol like
cannabis has a lot of hormetic effects and
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can see on the right this is a
rodent study of a model of heart attack at
[SPEAKER_00]: low doses of resveratrol the damage and
apoptosis to the heart is decreased but if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go too high on the dose of resveratrol
you actually increase the damage to the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart you see that so it's a healthy thing
at a low dose but it can be toxic at a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher dose however let's look at another
model of resveratrol here are breast
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cells and you can see that at low
concentrations it's accelerating the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of these cells but at high
concentrations it's inhibiting how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: get it right how do we know and how do we
use hormesis in medicine well it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually used a lot in medicine here's one
example that some of you may be familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with it's called preconditioning hormesis
so if you remember the movie the princess
[SPEAKER_00]: bride the pirate was going through this
battle of wits with the clever villain and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was poison that could be placed in
one goblet of wine or the other but the
[SPEAKER_00]: pirate put it in both because he had spent
years before this battle of wits taking
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny doses of the same poison every day
and gradually increasing his dose so that
[SPEAKER_00]: if he ever had this opportunity he would
win the battle that's preconditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: hormesis he took tiny doses of a toxin to
upregulate his endogenous healing
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms so that when he had a big
challenge he could handle it it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same as the idea of probably
the old definition of vaccines who knows
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happened to the new one but not
exactly the same as that but kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: similar right expose yourself to a
non-lethal dose of something that could
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare you for something bigger in the
future so that's preconditioning hormesis
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there's also post conditioning
hormesis oops what happened we went back
[SPEAKER_00]: post conditioning hormesis which is
probably most well-known in homeopathy but
[SPEAKER_00]: what a lot of you probably don't know is
that cannabis has been in the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: homeopathy since 1841 and you give tiny
tiny tiny doses of cannabis to people that
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibit the symptoms of having too much
cannabis they haven't had too much
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis but those are their symptoms so
you're giving something similar that could
[SPEAKER_00]: produce those in a big dose but you're
giving it in such a small dose that the
[SPEAKER_00]: body will correct it'll again upregulate
these correct negative mechanisms in our
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology so how does cannabis work well
I think a lot of us are focused on the way
[SPEAKER_00]: in which it mimics and supports our innate
stress response pathways but could it also
[SPEAKER_00]: act as a hormetic stressor I'm going to
show you some evidence that it certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: can and I want to orient you to this
ultra-low dose now it's impossible to
[SPEAKER_00]: convert a dose that's injected into a
rodent into an oral dose for humans but I
[SPEAKER_00]: do my best here so a lot of these studies
I'm about to show you use point zero zero
[SPEAKER_00]: two milligrams of THC per kilogram of body
weight of the rodent intraperitoneal
[SPEAKER_00]: injection is about five times better
absorbed than oral there's this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: elementary scaling law from rodents to
people and so what we might end up with is
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody my size having or a little little
smaller than me having like a twentieth of
[SPEAKER_00]: a milligram of THC orally this is the kind
of dosing range that I'm about to show you
[SPEAKER_00]: something between like a hundred and a
half a milligram of THC let's just give it
[SPEAKER_00]: a range okay so we're actually going to
start out just a little bit lower here's a
[SPEAKER_00]: study from 2007 in which a single
injection of point zero zero one
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per kilogram had a significant
negative impact on the performance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mice three weeks later and their their
performance was in a stressful memory test
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Morris water maze test okay one
teeny injection measured them three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: later compared to vehicle and the ones
that got the small dose of THC did worse
[SPEAKER_00]: also interestingly when you give a high
dose of THC to rodents they get
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothermia analgesia and decreased
locomotion also catalepsy but they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: do that in this study give this tiny dose
of THC to the rodents and they get the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite they get warmer they get
sensitive to pain and they and they run
[SPEAKER_00]: around more what the heck is going on here
we saw these paradoxical effects with the
[SPEAKER_00]: overdose now we're seeing paradoxical
effects with an under dose or maybe the 10
[SPEAKER_00]: megs per kg is the overdose it's hard to
say so then a subsequent study looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: point zero zero two milligrams per
kilogram a single injection which was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to induce measurable cognitive deficits in
normal mice five months later give them a
[SPEAKER_00]: single shot of point zero zero two measure
them five months later compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicle and and you can determine that
they're impaired and and you can measure
[SPEAKER_00]: different pathways have been upregulated
in the cerebellum five months later in
[SPEAKER_00]: mice after a single injection now what's
strange about these mice they're normal
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the strangest thing about them
something that I can't claim about any of
[SPEAKER_00]: you out there or about myself because who
among us is a wild type with no other
[SPEAKER_00]: toxins or challenges in their life right
so what happens when we treat mice that
[SPEAKER_00]: may be have a challenge in their life so
this is a toxin called penicillin
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrazole and it was injected at a high
dose 60 milligrams per kilogram it's known
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce neurotoxicity and in this study
the researchers administered that same
[SPEAKER_00]: single dose of THC but either before the
toxic challenge or after so
[SPEAKER_00]: preconditioning or post conditioning like
we talked about one three or seven days
[SPEAKER_00]: before one or three days after the
behavioral tests evaluated different
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of memory and learning three to
seven weeks later and what these
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers found was that both the
preconditioning and the post conditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: administration of ultra low dose THC
completely obliterated the damage from the
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic challenge and demonstrated reduced
phosphorylated ERK activity so we have
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence of ultra low dose pre and post
conditioning and a toxic challenge this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference between using cannabis and
isolate environment where it could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually reduce the function because
you're giving it maybe a tiny bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: toxin versus using it to up regulate the
healing now it doesn't just do that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain it does that in the heart here's a
single low dose administered two hours
[SPEAKER_00]: before a myocardial infarction look at the
size of the infarct difference in that bar
[SPEAKER_00]: graph and that was the best result but if
you administered it 48 hours before a
[SPEAKER_00]: heart attack you still got measurable
statistically significant cardio
[SPEAKER_00]: protection if you gave the same low dose
every day for three weeks and stopped 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours before the heart attack still got
cardio protection what could these ultra
[SPEAKER_00]: low doses be doing it's not just in the
brain not just in the heart it's also in
[SPEAKER_00]: the liver here's liver enzyme measurements
when the ultra low dose of THC was
[SPEAKER_00]: administered two hours before an ischemia
reperfusion injury in rodents and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see much lower levels of ALT and AST on
the right on the left it's the sham group
[SPEAKER_00]: that just got the surgery but not the
liver injury so that's all just purified
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and an ultra low dose just a little
sample of what's out there and then here
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a lower dose but not ultra low
dose three milligrams per kilogram per day
[SPEAKER_00]: given to mice that had cognitive decline
so these are old mice they're exhibiting
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of dementia give them this low dose
of THC for a month and it restored the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene transcription patterns so that the
expression of these THC treated 12 month
[SPEAKER_00]: old mice was almost identical to the two
month old mice literally like turned the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression in their mind around in
their brain around here's a here's a map
[SPEAKER_00]: just to remind you that we're dealing with
a lot of complexity here these are all the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that had a change from comparative
vehicle all of these different genes were
[SPEAKER_00]: upregulated in pink and some were
downregulated and their pathways are
[SPEAKER_00]: interrelated we are living in such a
complex this diagram makes me think of
[SPEAKER_00]: like trying to use our equipment to
understand something that's much more
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent than us right and we're
getting there but we're definitely not
[SPEAKER_00]: there I'm sure this is also just the tip
of the iceberg so now we're back to ultra
[SPEAKER_00]: low dose 24 month old mice injected with a
point zero zero two milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram performed significantly better
than those that did not get that injection
[SPEAKER_00]: or not get the THC and performed similarly
to mice aged two months so the last study
[SPEAKER_00]: was low dose every day for 28 days this
was a single ultra low dose injection
[SPEAKER_00]: restored 24 month old mice to the behavior
levels of two month that and that effect
[SPEAKER_00]: lasted for seven weeks what the heck is
going on here in this ultra low dose range
[SPEAKER_00]: and the pathways by which this works some
of them were elucidated sir two and one is
[SPEAKER_00]: a pathway that's gaining a lot of
attention kind of in the biohacking world
[SPEAKER_00]: and I oh yeah and then the MRI just
demonstrated larger volume and higher
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue density in various regions of the
brain and the mice that received the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually changed the volume of their
brain a single ultra low dose measurable
[SPEAKER_00]: differences for seven weeks and then the
last rodent model I'll show you this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: familial Alzheimer's disease model mice
that were either six or twelve months were
[SPEAKER_00]: given a single low dose injection ultra
low dose injection and a lot of cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: tests what's interesting here is on the
left that's the water Morris maze the
[SPEAKER_00]: higher levels okay so dark is vehicle
light is ultra low dose WT means the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: type the healthy mice and the TG means
transgenic the Alzheimer's mice and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just look at the Alzheimer's mice you can
see getting that ultra low dose of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: really improve their performance on this
water maze test it also improved the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance a little bit of the wild type
mice if you look at the novel location
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition in the middle you can see the
wild type was a trend towards decreased
[SPEAKER_00]: performance and same in the Y maze so
again we have the same thing that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: gently hurting wild type mice helping mice
that have a disease that's an important
[SPEAKER_00]: point and then yesterday we heard about
the trick be one receptor pathway for BDNF
[SPEAKER_00]: well these transgenic Alzheimer's mice
they express a truncated trip B receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not functional it's like a broken
receptor and the ratio of that broken
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor to the fully functional receptor
determines our capacity to respond to BDNF
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow new neurons and new synapses and
heal the brain and you can see here also
[SPEAKER_00]: the ultra low dose of THC significantly
reduced the expression of that truncated
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor meaning their BDNF pathway
pathway was working better so these what
[SPEAKER_00]: are the mechanisms we talked about
hormesis but I want to go beyond hormesis
[SPEAKER_00]: into pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
synergy that means how they're working
[SPEAKER_00]: together or how they're absorbed and
metabolized because so far we've only
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about THC but let's look at CBDA
for example now the scale here is
[SPEAKER_00]: micrograms per kilogram not milligrams per
kilogram and you can see here that half or
[SPEAKER_00]: one microgram per kilogram of CBDA reduces
nausea in rodents which is very different
[SPEAKER_00]: from CBD you can see the effectiveness of
CBD is here at five or ten milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram not half of a microgram per
kilogram so much higher potency now you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what else you see with the CBD
picture is the there we go so you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that at very high doses of CBD even
without the lithium chloride challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: even just with saline you get some nausea
and at the 20 and 40 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram you get an exacerbation of the
effects of the lithium chloride which is
[SPEAKER_00]: what causes the nausea so we're back to
this biphasic dose response model right
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a sweet spot in there so so what
about combinations here's a study that
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at ultra low dose THC a and CBDA in
combination for nausea these are tiny tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: doses point zero zero zero zero one
milligrams per kilogram of CBDA another
[SPEAKER_00]: very low dose of THC a these two doses on
their own are not effective put them
[SPEAKER_00]: together and you see that they are
effective with the bar graph that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the middle and then if you block
the P par alpha receptor you ameliorate
[SPEAKER_00]: that benefit and if you block the
serotonin receptor it goes away as well
[SPEAKER_00]: similar things happen with CBDA and pain
here you see 10 micrograms per kilogram of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA reducing hyperalgesia but a thousand
micrograms per kilogram meaning one
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram per kilogram not reducing
hyperalgesia there's another sweet spot
[SPEAKER_00]: here do you need the tiniest little bit of
CBDA maybe it's it's hard to know this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a model of inflammatory pain and the CBDA
was only effective when given before the
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammatory challenge and that was given
via injection however if you give it
[SPEAKER_00]: orally and you give it with a teeny bit of
THC a bit of THC on its own that does
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing so now we're at a hundred
micrograms per kilogram but when you give
[SPEAKER_00]: them together orally it works that's what
we're seeing here and it even works when
[SPEAKER_00]: you give it after the inflammatory insult
so it works even better than the CBDA on
[SPEAKER_00]: its own at the precise dose when it's
injected what's going on with CBDA here's
[SPEAKER_00]: an example of pharmacokinetic interactions
this was a beautiful study from Jonathan
[SPEAKER_00]: Arnold's group in Australia they tested a
whole plant compound which you see on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left it's got just about everything in it
you know acidic and neutrals and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: tested the exact same doses of those
isolated substances for oral
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailability in rodents and this is
what you would expect to find when you
[SPEAKER_00]: would administer lipophilic compounds
together they can compete with absorption
[SPEAKER_00]: and so you would expect to see better
absorption from purified CBD than the same
[SPEAKER_00]: dose of CBD given in the context of this
extract so that's a normal finding this
[SPEAKER_00]: was the unexpected finding CBDA when
administered in the context of the full
[SPEAKER_00]: plant extract was much much better
absorbed 14 times better absorbed than the
[SPEAKER_00]: same dose given on its own why is CBDA
absorbs so much better when it's given in
[SPEAKER_00]: the full plant extract well these
researchers determined that there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: efflux pump called the BCRP that kicks
these cannabinoids back into the lumen of
[SPEAKER_00]: the intestine as they're being absorbed
but if you have a little bit of CBG or a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of THC in there it blocks the
function of this efflux pump in relation
[SPEAKER_00]: to CBDA and it makes you absorb much more
CBDA so 14 times the absorption when
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a tiny bit of THC or CBG we
haven't proven this in humans but we do
[SPEAKER_00]: have some human data that shows that CBDA
is much much better absorbed than CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: again in these studies it was between 5
and 11 times better absorbed THC is 32 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 51 times better absorbed than THC just
remarkable so we're going to bring it home
[SPEAKER_00]: right now and I just want to remind you
that there's a lot of cannabinoids in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and we're exposed to them at ultra
low doses all the time what is going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here we don't know but we can have a
direct relationship with the plant to help
[SPEAKER_00]: us find out I'm going to skip through one
example of clinical data because I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get to my recommendations and maybe a
question or two so for researchers I
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage you to take what you've learned
today and design studies that include a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of doses or concentrations that can
reveal nonlinear dose response effects and
[SPEAKER_00]: please don't forget to go down to
microgram per kilogram rodent studies if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the opportunity to do so because
you probably find some very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: things down there test-trace cannabinoids
and other phytoconstituents alone and in
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations we have Henanite and DETI
that have been doing this and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really exciting that's where this research
needs to go for producers I encourage you
[SPEAKER_00]: to test a broad to include a broad range
of compounds try to get as much from that
[SPEAKER_00]: flower into the body bottle as you can
avoid complete decarboxylation because
[SPEAKER_00]: even tiny bits of these acidic
cannabinoids go a long way as you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: they might actually go a longer way than
high doses and please make your labels and
[SPEAKER_00]: certificates of analysis easy to
understand I just that's a big problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry I don't think it's been
mentioned much it should be easy for a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient to know how much they're getting
per drop or per serving here's an example
[SPEAKER_00]: of a part of the COA from a healer product
called balance which includes 19 chemovars
[SPEAKER_00]: six of them are CBD dominant type 3 and
the rest are type 1 we blend as many
[SPEAKER_00]: together as we can it's half
decarboxylated it's got equal proportions
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD, CBDA, THC, THCA this is like a
shotgun product I hope that eventually we
[SPEAKER_00]: know here's the specific chemovar for this
specific problem and this specific person
[SPEAKER_00]: with their current functional status and
their genetics we're far from that right
[SPEAKER_00]: now so until I can get my laser pointer
and sniper rifle we're gonna go with the
[SPEAKER_00]: shotgun right the balance for clinicians
and patients I encourage you to explore
[SPEAKER_00]: this oral dosing range in your patients
don't start too high this means starting
[SPEAKER_00]: as low as half a milligram or maybe one
milligram for the average adult and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: do that and you take your time and wait
that they might not get great results the
[SPEAKER_00]: next morning and be like oh my god that
was amazing my life has changed you gave
[SPEAKER_00]: me my life back I know it feels really
good to hear that but if they stay
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent with low doses for a little
while they'll get some impressive results
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be surprised and that's especially
with acidic cannabinoids and whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations and titrate slowly if
possible use cannabis to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience to stress don't always think
about it for treating a disease think
[SPEAKER_00]: about what could it do to up regulate your
natural healing mechanisms turning on
[SPEAKER_00]: these intrinsic mechanisms may provide
better results than just ameliorating
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms because you're getting healthier
you're getting stronger you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more fit for your environment your
homeostatic physiology is functioning more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently and that's not only going to
make you feel better but prevent future
[SPEAKER_00]: disease instead of just covering up a
symptom without addressing the underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: vulnerability so watch for gradual changes
healing versus symptom relief and
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary outcomes and side benefits and
know yourself cannabis is very complex but
[SPEAKER_00]: so are you and you have a direct
relationship with this plant or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: the capacity to do so so the cannabis
state of consciousness can be extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: empowering for self-awareness and body
awareness one can use a little bit of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually go inside and feel and get
extremely accurate messages about what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening inside of them so allow the
consciousness shifting aspect of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: from time to time to help you get better
in touch with yourself with all our healer
[SPEAKER_00]: products we include these guides so people
can check in with themselves do the inner
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory right it down on the worksheet
and so forth and then my last
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation page if you're a patient
and you're not using acidic cannabinoids I
[SPEAKER_00]: highly encourage you to do so easiest way
is take a little bud and throw it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: morning tea or coffee you'll steep it
you'll get a little bit out of that and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can tell you more about that if you need
to avoid tolerance in most cases so check
[SPEAKER_00]: out that sensitization protocol if you
feel like you're overusing you'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: much healthier and more fruitful
relationship with cannabis if you reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance and then be aware of the subtle
benefits try a variety of chemo bars and
[SPEAKER_00]: blends of chemo bars and and the cannabis
tea is just a great thing for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people thank you so much
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you very much testing for your great
talk and your great work I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: you a what do you think how low would you
go would you touch that in rodents or in
[SPEAKER_01]: humans humans what what is the line
between going low and homeopathy yeah so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that well because I've seen results
in adults at half a milligram of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: constituent today that's how low I go
right now I don't like to waste a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people's time and that might still be a
time waster I skipped over a study in
[SPEAKER_00]: fibromyalgia women with fibromyalgia where
they were started at one about one
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram of THC per day and were titrated
only every ten days and they had fabulous
[SPEAKER_00]: results with with that type of titration
they went from one to two you know every
[SPEAKER_00]: ten days so something low and slow to me
sounds like that half a milligram to one
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram morning Dustin thank you so much
and for your spirit here question so
[SPEAKER_02]: titrating to find that optimal dosage how
about for tolerance breaks do you is it
[SPEAKER_02]: called turkey titrate down what's your
recommendation for that so the way I've
[SPEAKER_00]: framed the sensitization protocol on
healer.com involves 48 hours of abstinence
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis but it's very intentional
and I have all sorts of videos to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: your hand through that and give you
exercises bright breathing meditations
[SPEAKER_00]: things to to get you through that there's
a lot that you can do to get go through
[SPEAKER_00]: that 48 hours but a lot of there's one
fMRI study in men at least that were heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis smokers that showed after just 48
hours of abstinence their CB1 receptors in
[SPEAKER_00]: the brain return to normal levels so I
think that's one beautiful thing about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is we don't need super long
tolerance breaks 48 hours can do it but
[SPEAKER_00]: then we continue with three days that the
key to the sensitization protocol isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: just the tolerance break it's what you do
afterwards it's how you change your
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the plant to listen to
its effects on your body so that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get into a tolerance problem again in the
future so that's what's happening over the
[SPEAKER_00]: next three days very careful titration and
you can get that all it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: complimentary on healer.com I'm out of
time thank you so much it's great to be
[SPEAKER_00]: here with you you you
