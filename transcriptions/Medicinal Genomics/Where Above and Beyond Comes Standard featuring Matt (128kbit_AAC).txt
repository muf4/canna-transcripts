[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a call from a lab in Florida,
and they said that Aspergillus terius was
[SPEAKER_00]: showing up in all of their samples,
including the negative control.
[SPEAKER_00]: After talking with them, I learned that a
recent batch of R&D samples had tested
[SPEAKER_00]: positive for Aspergillus terius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speculated that possibly the samples
were so hot that the Aspergillus was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to sporulate and contaminate the entire
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaning up contamination in the lab is no
small task, and so I flew down the next
[SPEAKER_00]: day to pitch in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wiped down every surface with 10%
bleach, including the floors, pipettes,
[SPEAKER_00]: benches, and any equipment in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point, I was on my hands and knees
scrubbing the floor when our sales account
[SPEAKER_00]: manager walked in, and he really got a
kick out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: After several rounds of cleaning and
running blank samples to check if the mold
[SPEAKER_00]: was still present, we got a clean result.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab thanked me for going above and
beyond, but I was just doing my job.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
