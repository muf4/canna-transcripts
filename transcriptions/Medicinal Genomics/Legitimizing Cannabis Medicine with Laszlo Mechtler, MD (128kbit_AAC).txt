[SPEAKER_02]: this May.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our guest this episode is Dr. Laszlo
Mechler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mechler is the chief medical officer
at the Dent Neurologic Institute,
[SPEAKER_02]: the largest outpatient neuroscience center
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mechler is the director of the Dent
Cannabis Clinic, which has more than
[SPEAKER_02]: 15,000 patients certified through the NYS
MMJ program, and continues to grow each
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mechler has published some of the
first major retrospective research trials
[SPEAKER_02]: on medical marijuana and headaches and
other neurologic disorders, and lectures
[SPEAKER_02]: both nationally and internationally,
and is a recognized leader in the fields
[SPEAKER_02]: of neuroimaging, headache medicine,
neuro-oncology, and medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mechler is also a member of the
CANVAD24 advisory board.
[SPEAKER_02]: During our conversation, we discuss how
the Dent Institute is uniquely positioned
[SPEAKER_02]: to study medical cannabis for a variety of
conditions, results from recent studies
[SPEAKER_02]: conducted at the Dent Cannabis Clinic,
the challenges of studying medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and how a proposed rescheduling
could help, and the ongoing struggle to
[SPEAKER_02]: convince fellow clinicians and medical
associations that medical cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: legitimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation with Dr.
Mechler, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, the Dent Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: With more than 300,000 patient visits per
year, the Dent Neurologic Institute ranks
[SPEAKER_02]: amongst the largest neuroscience centers
in North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Its 24 subspecialty clinics often treat
the most challenging neurologic
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions, including, but not limited to,
migraine, chronic pain, ALS, MS,
[SPEAKER_02]: Parkinson's, dementia, and neuro-oncology.
[SPEAKER_02]: With their mission of advancing
neuroscience, the Dent Institute
[SPEAKER_02]: established a cannabis clinic in 2016 to
aid in the treatment of these conditions
[SPEAKER_02]: seen throughout the Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: To learn more, visit dentinstitute.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
Mechler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, Dr. Mechler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And first off, I want to thank you for
joining us on the CanMed 24 Advisory Board
[SPEAKER_02]: for this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were very fortunate to have you as a
presenter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might be referencing it a few
times throughout the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were fortunate to have you there and
have Dent, the Dent Institute,
[SPEAKER_02]: as a sponsor for the medical practicum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a great addition to the
event, and we're excited to have you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: involved again for next year in a bigger
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a real pleasure being there
and meeting colleagues and specialists in
[SPEAKER_00]: this field that was really eye-opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really am honored, and it's going to
be a great pleasure to be there for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you again for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm excited to catch up with you today
about all of the research and clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: studies that you and the team are doing at
the Dent Institute, because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: substantial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important, because those who are
hesitant or maybe oppose some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: legitimacy of cannabis medicine will
typically point to a lack of evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's vital that institutions like yours
are doing the work, as they say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you would, kind of tell the
audience a bit about the Dent Institute
[SPEAKER_02]: and your role there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Dent Institute was founded in the
1960s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you asked, it wasn't founded by
me, because that would make me too old.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been here close to 38 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the chief medical officer or medical
director of the Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the largest private neuroscience
institute in the United States by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a feel, we see about
1,300 patients every day in the field of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a private institute, but we work
with pharmacological or pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have close to 100 studies looking at
different drugs in the field of neurology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from Alzheimer's, MS,
headache, stroke, movement disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very active in our research
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pharmaceutical world knows about
us, saying that we're the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroscience institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say that in today's world,
research is done in academic centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people think that the private sector
doesn't do academic work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the private sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're a private institute run by
physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do a tremendous amount of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pharma world knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the reasons it was a
little bit complicated when I got into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you used a word called legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole thing is legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a full professor at the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the chief of neuro-oncology at a
cancer hospital called Roswell Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Dent Institute is our private
neurological institute, where in every
[SPEAKER_00]: year, we see over 310,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in my room right now,
I have four or five students from all
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the world listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very focused on research,
education, and taking care of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people with high-quality care.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when did the Dent Institute get
involved?
[SPEAKER_02]: In cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And was that sort of a logical fit for you
guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Illogical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not logical in any way,
shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only reason we got into it, because we
take care of so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when cannabis was made legal in New
York state about six, seven years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were getting phone calls, 500 a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a user.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even use alcohol, which makes me
tremendously boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point is, the next day,
it was another 500 phone calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third day, another 500 phone calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you run a business, you can
imagine how much money and energy it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: to answer those phone calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, look, let's get into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make a clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start learning about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because our business model is so
private and not institutional,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to set up a cannabis clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the next six, seven years,
it took that amount of time to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of cannabis in patients with
neurological symptoms, including pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're self-taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical school?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't teach it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only good places to learn is at
these conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was honored to be at these
conferences everywhere from Tel Aviv to
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta, Europe, and the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been learning as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I feel I have an expertise,
because how do physicians understand
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to see patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now in the clinic, we have over
13,000 patients on cannabis for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't deal with recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need to emphasize that I'm purely on
the medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm purely there to legitimize this whole
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So was there a light bulb moment,
or was there a specific piece of evidence
[SPEAKER_02]: that you saw that kind of clicked in your
head that there's something to this
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as you're seeing patients,
as they come up to you and then throw
[SPEAKER_00]: their arms around you and hug you,
that's the changing moment, that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: found something where patients said,
you changed my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me off opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: My quality of life has improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with tears in their eyes, they're
hugging you and saying, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the moment that every physician
wants in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got that in cannabis, interesting
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I deal with bad diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I deal with brain cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my specialties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you never get that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it changed the way I practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do brain tumor research and
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do other things in neurology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis has been an eye-opening
moment where you can change the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: life of individuals by understanding how
cannabis works on human beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how did the studies work at the
Dent Institute?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do patients become enrolled?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how does that process sort of start?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to teach the audience how
difficult it is to do research in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the same time, we have every
pharmaceutical company come in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do phase one, phase two, phase three
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a whole research team looking and
putting patients on board for these drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are using, for example,
in migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you get the support?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who pays for that research?
[SPEAKER_00]: What company?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I realized very fast, if I want to do
research in cannabis, it has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: self-funded initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do our own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that perspective of being federally
legal, being a schedule one drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: made it very difficult to do perspective
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sitting and I say, well,
let's get a schedule one license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I realized back then, if I do get a
schedule one license, who can tell me that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis that I'm using is of high
quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is, as we all know, initially it
came from Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided initially not to get the
schedule one license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to do the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said the initial studies of the
literature were small studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 patients, 30 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the criticism from the medical
community that these are small studies and
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that are not academically
worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about if we do retrospective large
population studies?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may open up the eyes for
clinicians and academic physicians in
[SPEAKER_00]: that, okay, we're not talking about 25
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about hundreds of patients and
look at them retrospectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's population-based research,
but larger numbers than what we've had in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've had the opportunity to do that
in multiple subspecialties of neurology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from MS Parkinson's,
headaches, for example, dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking also at other diseases like
autism, peripheral neuropathy,
[SPEAKER_00]: trigeminal neurology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going down the list of neurological
disorders and getting large populations
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking at efficacy and side effect
profile, which is very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios and dosage of what I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put that on a data bank that I have
of now 13,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been very interesting to do this
type of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, hopefully if this becomes
a schedule three drug, maybe things will
[SPEAKER_00]: change for clinicians like myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, and I definitely want to touch
on that, but before we do, so when you say
[SPEAKER_02]: retrospectively, so is that you're putting
patients on a course of medicine of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis medicine and then sort of
checking in with them after a defined
[SPEAKER_02]: period of time and saying, you know,
how has it helped you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you treat somebody?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking at patients are not going
to get, do not want to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 75 year old female with rheumatoid
arthritis who doesn't smoke, doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: drink, doesn't do marijuana, does not want
to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I have a problem with the
cannabis world because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: think, oh, patient just want to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at a different population.
[SPEAKER_00]: These patients want to be cautious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not want to get higher with their
grandchildren.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be cognitively sharp,
but they want pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want symptom relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so as I'm seeing this patients,
I'm realizing which ratios may work in
[SPEAKER_00]: which age group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to be also very knowledgeable
about what medications are taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, many of these patients who are at
75 years old, they're on 15 different
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just, and that may have asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to give them a vape if
they have asthma and on anticoagulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's things you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I think it's important that
in medical cannabis programs, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: physician or a physician extender who is
very knowledgeable in how to use his
[SPEAKER_00]: medication, treat these patients because
and then very important, come back in a
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can adjust the dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust the titration schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust the ratio depending on the
side effects and symptoms and efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to keep an eye on these
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in medical marijuana programs,
a lot of people are seeing that I'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: you back in one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, patients don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be nurtured through their,
through this experience and see somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's knowledgeable and then they can see
and follow up regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they get stable, then you can see
them later in six months or 12 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where do you source the medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you just sort of giving
recommendations and then they have to go
[SPEAKER_02]: to the dispensary and sort of get the
medicine themselves?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York state, strict rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if as a physician, I can't be involved
in the business of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a dispensary here for
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are CBD products that I
got involved with because that's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: different world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, CBD products less than 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in medical marijuana, we're an
institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have a dispensary in the
institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my area, we have three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good news is that after some
initial hurdles, initial difficulties,
[SPEAKER_00]: they realized that whatever I want,
I want my patients to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't change it at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example would be initially a patient
went there, I gave a tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was switched to a vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient ended up in the emergency room
because the butt tender or whoever worked
[SPEAKER_00]: at the dispensary did not know that the
patient had asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are just one example,
but I work very well with the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They respect my knowledge and they
understand that I'm adamant if I certify
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody for a ratio or dosage,
that's what they're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned before that when the
medical marijuana program came on,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a ton of interest and you were
getting a lot of phone calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: How has that interest changed over the
years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it more than ever now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, New York State is a big state,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 20 million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the New York State program,
I myself see 10% of all patients in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's include New York City,
Long Island, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a lot of patients, most of them
in regionally, some are long distance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have to be within New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't come from Florida because you
need a New York State license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the program is a little bit rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rigidity of the program,
meaning everything has to be tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: has helped me because I know what my
patients are getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important for me to understand
because when you buy things off the
[SPEAKER_00]: street, you have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that literature has shown
that cannabis off the streets has a high
[SPEAKER_00]: incidence of contaminants, everything from
heavy metals, everything from bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus, pesticides, insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to know my patients are
getting something that is tested often,
[SPEAKER_00]: hence the expense is higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is an issue in most medical
marijuana programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if I answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went on a monologue, which I do
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good thing about the program is
that I like the fact that it's strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked a question about drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you know, New York State went from
medical, now it's recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has there been a drop off?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people feel it's complicated
because in New York State, we have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of reservations in Western New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a reservation being sovereign land,
they actually have their own cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, what I've seen is that what
they're getting is not always what was
[SPEAKER_00]: advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of contaminants and some of
those contaminants, I've had positive LSD
[SPEAKER_00]: with people on cannabis who have side
effects and hallucinatory paranoid
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've asked New York State to protect the
medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you may know, Ben, when
recreational marijuana comes into a state,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually it affects the medical marijuana
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think my numbers are down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's be fair, now I'm seeing patients
who really, really are interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana and don't want it for
recreational reasons.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think it's a case that some
people think that they can sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: self-medicate, you know, just go through
the recreational program rather than kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of get a physician involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the younger patients think that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the younger you are, the more
likely that you don't go to a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we have a very strong
presence as an institute and as a
[SPEAKER_00]: physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in this community for over 35
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they kind of know your reputation
as a cannabis doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think a lot of patients come to
me and are comfortable with the knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also say one thing that I'm very
different to anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started the program,
I said, I'm going to legitimize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, how do I legitimize a program
where people are making a business out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of doctors got involved for the sake
of seeing a lot of patients in a short
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time and billing them $250 cash,
sometimes $350, not including a urine
[SPEAKER_00]: test, which is another additional money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were paying $800 on an office
visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, what if I don't accept their
cash?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unheard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean you don't accept people's
cash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who doesn't accept cash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you accept cash, that to me is
not a legitimate process in medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, I'm not going to accept any
cash from any patient who comes to me for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked to the CEOs of insurance
companies, health insurance companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, look, I'm going to see your
patient, but I want to be the patient's
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor, not just giving him certifying for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they got back pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I became the treating physician,
which means that I dictate a three page
[SPEAKER_00]: note.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if they had multiple
sclerosis and they have not had an MRI in
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years, then maybe I'll do an MRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they have back pain, I like to know
why they have back pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to go to the etiology of the
symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had trigeminal neuralgia,
which is pain in the face, I like to know
[SPEAKER_00]: what medications you're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to become the treating
physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that reason, I built the insurance
company and all of them said yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've not had a problem in six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a patient comes to me,
they'll have to pay cash at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, but they don't pay cash with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll accept whatever their insurance pays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you may understand a lot of
these individuals don't have good
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance because they've been disabled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not working because of low back
pain or chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what the insurance pays is not
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really doesn't matter at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I serve 13,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a very strong reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, this is legitimizing the whole
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody accepts cash as a physician,
I'm not critical of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do a good job and not just certify
the patient and say goodbye, if they
[SPEAKER_00]: really keep an eye on them, then yeah,
I don't have a problem with somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: accepting cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at my institute, I said no to that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there definitely was a cottage
industry that popped up of just writing
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations and being done with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know of people flying in from a
different state and going to a strip mall,
[SPEAKER_00]: renting an office for one day and flying
back the same day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard stories, too, of doctors
setting up booths at conferences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just walk up and they'll write the
recommendation for you and just keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: line moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then initially, I'm not sure if it's
still being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, there are these 1-800 numbers,
these phone numbers that you don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: have to see the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is call a phone number,
get certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't understand that's such a
money focus way to take care of human
[SPEAKER_00]: beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel strongly that and maybe
that's because I'm a professor of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurology oncology at a cancer hospital
and here at the institute that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: think that if we take care of people,
we should do it in an ethical way with
[SPEAKER_00]: empathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind if there's money at the tail
end of this for physicians or institutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think we can't lose the fact that
patients want to be taken care of,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, in medical marijuana programs,
not recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't believe in calling a number and
getting certified and then see you one
[SPEAKER_00]: year and accept $250 from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's not taking care of human
beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think part of the problem,
too, is something that you touched on
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, is that most medical
professionals are not educated on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a lot of these patients who
want access to cannabis can't really go to
[SPEAKER_02]: their primary care doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have an intelligent conversation about
it because, you know, they're just not
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was one of those six,
seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I admit I'm the first one to admit that
this is a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a road that I had to go down and
understand and go to conferences and read
[SPEAKER_00]: books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really has opened up my eyes and
understanding why we're in the situation
[SPEAKER_00]: we are today, because then comes the
politics of cannabis, the social impact on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and to understand where why
we are here today, you need to go back,
[SPEAKER_00]: historically understand the history of
cannabis, not the one about 2000 years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: or a thousand years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Shaughnessy in Calcutta, India in the
19th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the 20th century history
and how we are here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from from Nixon and why we are
here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in the situation we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get a bit of comfort with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's transition to some of the
research that that your team is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you might have some newly
published research into a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two types of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the retrospective retrospective
large population studies in specific
[SPEAKER_00]: neurological disorders?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we published recently was
that by grade discussion, chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: migraines and headaches, which is really,
I think, very impactful in that treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: of that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done a lot of recent
pharmacokinetic studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at CBD products and how what the
pharmacokinetics are of different CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: products in healthy individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would call pharmacokinetic
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done several of those recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has recently published is two
publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one has been accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the other one has just been
accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, without educating people on MS,
we have one of the highest MS populations
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States, if not the world in
Western New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So MS is we have thousands of MS patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a population of MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did publish an article of multiple
sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of cannabis, which is relatively
interesting because according from the
[SPEAKER_00]: results that about 72 percent of patients
pain was alleviated or improved
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they have spasticity that improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opioid use was decreased by a
significant amount of patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: either completely or partially,
but statistically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a very strong
neuropharmacological division of the debt
[SPEAKER_00]: run by excellent PharmD doctors such as
Dr. Ranka, Dr. Aladeen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, we're very fortunate to have
that team work with us hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other article that we recently
published is medical treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's disease, which we all see
Parkinson's disease in that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifty six percent of patients either
stopped opioids or decreased it
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, we saw about 69 patients,
about 87 percent of patients said that
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of life has improved on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that article is called medical
cannabis in the treatment of Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lead author is is Tracy Aberdeen,
who is our one of our farm pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that's an interesting article to
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have retrospective looking at
studies looking at quality of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects, side effect profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in the MS study, the main
side effect was fatigue, 11 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me tell you, one of the main
symptoms of MS is fatigue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to say that the 11 percent
side effect was actually from the drug or
[SPEAKER_00]: not, because, as I mentioned, it's a
common side effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so these are out of the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of abstracts we present at
the American Academy of Neurology.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, for the first time ever,
I ran a course on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm proud to say not a hundred people
showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several hundred people showed up for the
symposium at the American Academy of
[SPEAKER_00]: Neurology, which is probably one of more
conservative medical societies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the business of cannabis, you don't
have to win over patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've won them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to win over most of the
politicians because most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians you won them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the medical society you haven't won
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've won the doctors over.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctors individually believe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the medical societies that control the
behavior of doctors, you haven't won them
[SPEAKER_00]: over, have you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to their websites and they say,
yeah, we think there may be something
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but we don't want you to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you hear across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you win the medical societies
over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I ran a symposium at the American
Academy of Neurology, which is very well
[SPEAKER_00]: received.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often will lecture there and give
abstracts even at the American Headache
[SPEAKER_00]: Society or other neurological societies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go to Europe quite often to lecture
at the European societies, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: surprisingly is probably a little bit more
rigid than the American societies in many
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you asked me, what ongoing studies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're looking at ALS.
[SPEAKER_00]: ALS, most people know the term Lou
Gehrig's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at a retrospective study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you some preliminary findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we see about 79% improvement in
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we looked at dementia, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're an aging population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dementia is going to be a major issue for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: As our lifespan increases, as we get
older, it's a major issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a 65% improvement in quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get into the specifics
because it hasn't been published,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're very optimistic about that
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a study looking at epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that a CBD product, Epidiolex,
has been approved by the FDA via GW
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of
Lennox-Galstat and Dravaise and even
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuberose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are three rare types of seizures,
and Epidiolex has been approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at our population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We added cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a 71% reduction in seizure control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, retrospective, not perspective,
not something that would be accepted as a
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA approved drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at anxiety and insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a 50% reduction in insomnia and 45%
reduction in anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking at autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one of my colleagues, Dr. McVig,
who is a pediatric neurologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very much interested in putting the
research in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're doing now, educating
physicians, educating the population,
[SPEAKER_00]: educating the business world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that the medical
associations are the ones you need to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that fight going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like fighting Mike Tyson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that if you can't change him
from the outside, change him from the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult because they always
back off and say, where is the research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the perspective, randomized
research?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it our fault?
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's a schedule one drug and it's FDA
illegal?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand academically what they say,
but there's a lot of drugs we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at them, these old drugs,
they weren't randomized studies and we
[SPEAKER_00]: still use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding and being respectful for
where they're coming from, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to do the randomized studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the cannabis doctors have to be
legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to come with some legitimacy in
their credentials and understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fighting an uphill battle that you
will win one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be one and maybe
de-schedulizing it to schedule three is
[SPEAKER_00]: the first step to do randomized studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you could change the perspective of
the academic medical societies in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country around the world, not just the
United States, but the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it takes a lead on anything,
then most of the other countries will step
[SPEAKER_00]: up and continue what the American results
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hopefully getting these studies done
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for sponsors, which is very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to sponsor my study?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis business is not hot anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stocks are down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a shortage of money and who's
going to throw millions of dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not thousands, millions of
dollars for a randomized study looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: placebo versus different ratios of
cannabis and migraine, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to work, but who's going to
sponsor that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the government sponsor that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get federal money on a federally
legally company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get it from the NIH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be done state within the state
and it has to be done by a company that
[SPEAKER_00]: will support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, we should join forces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who works with cannabis,
every business puts in into a bank and
[SPEAKER_00]: from that bank have a committee looking at
good scientific research and then
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsoring it from that bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the physician groups can then publish
these things prospectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a possibility in the
future, something we can talk about at our
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to bring that up that these
cannabis companies, they're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: fund the research partially because
they're not going to have a proprietary
[SPEAKER_02]: drug either.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a natural medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you publish that research, then you're
actually emboldening your competitors as
[SPEAKER_02]: well and not just you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to look at the big picture and
you can't look at your own interests,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very difficult today because the
fact that companies are not doing well and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking at the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: To support research, if it's positive,
if it's good, it's going to be good for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to look at the big picture and
hopefully one day we'll see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned rescheduling and I think
that's something that we're all watching
[SPEAKER_02]: and hopeful for that we'll see some
movement there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it does get rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what schedule three is what's on
the table here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would things change for you if that
were to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to change a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule three is like ketamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think tonic code number three is in
schedule three also.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it's still going to be
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Locally, I could do a prospective study
looking at cannabis in a treatment of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a protocol which I wrote for
this for chronic migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Migraine is defined by reporting 15
headaches a month and I can look at a
[SPEAKER_00]: placebo or a 20 to one, one to one ratio,
five, 10, 15, 20 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a prospective study.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be several arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask me who's going to fund that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say right now, nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to fund it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fund it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a benevolent debt family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dent was a philanthropist back in the 60s
who, by the way, had Parkinson's disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: started the Institute in 1963.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a family, non-for-profit family
foundation that supports research within
[SPEAKER_00]: the Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, by the way, for the last six,
seven years have unequivocally supported
[SPEAKER_00]: my research in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has given me the opportunity to
publish, to put us on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still support, but we're not talking
about millions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about significant amount,
but they do support us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm going to get some seed money
from them to support a study if I can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that, if it becomes a Schedule III drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can publish that article
prospectively, randomized study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the money from seed money from the
Dent family foundation, part of the money
[SPEAKER_00]: through the Dent cannabis clinic will
readjust money to put it in research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of putting it in our pockets,
we'll put it in research, self-funded if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to use the term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can publish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we publish that, I could show it to
the insurance companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show it to the medical societies and
then let them critique it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things is, one of the problems
I think you may understand is cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana or medical cannabis
programs are too expensive for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a way you don't have to pay me cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a positive for the patient,
but they have to pay in cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these patients are paying $800 a
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me be honest with you, in the medical
marijuana program, most of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can't afford it and the
insurance companies throw their arms up
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, we're sympathetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that if you put somebody on
medical marijuana, they'll take less
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids, they'll take less Xanax,
they'll take less sleeping pills,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll take less anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for the insurance companies,
but they fall back on the fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: no research.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a prospective study,
the first thing I'm going to do is present
[SPEAKER_00]: it to every CEO of every insurance company
because let's pay for this because A,
[SPEAKER_00]: I save you money, I keep patients out of
emergency rooms, they have less testing
[SPEAKER_00]: because their quality of life have
improved and they're using less drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing I'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may change something at that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the medical societies will look at
it, critique it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be published in peer-reviewed
journals, which is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we start moving at the medical
society level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm optimistic that for me, it's going to
be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a step in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's going to help the
business up cannabis because it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still taxation issues,
banking issues, as you all know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just read what I read.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my perspective, I think it's a
positive move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a lot that goes into it,
but it being a schedule three drug would
[SPEAKER_02]: not preclude them from covering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a schedule three drug,
but anything you use it for, it's off
[SPEAKER_00]: label because it's off label because it's
not been approved in that disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, what disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: Say migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 36 million migraineurs in this
country, 36 or 700,000 patients in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States with MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they approve it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't because show me the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I prove a drug off label that
there's no science that shows it works?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go testimonials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have patients who can't live
without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testimonials don't count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Randomized phase two, phase three studies
do count.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we'll have to do, and we'll do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then would it come down to that they would
approve a certain formulation or a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: product, or could it be as broad as
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you open up a can of worms because
that's the criticism of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't patent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're dealing with is never sativa or
indica, they're all hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do a study, how rigid and strict
is the use of cannabis, and what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: using actually?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's one of the advantages of New
York State because our patients know
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the ratio is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it with recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be a regulated cannabis coming
from probably one facility that's tested
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly, each batch, and look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be easy, but it'll be a step in
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're all hopeful that that's
what's going to happen, but it remains to
[SPEAKER_02]: be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying one of the problems is that a
lot of smart doctors, a lot of smart
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers are working at the best places
in the country, academic centers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA funded by research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a fear of doing cannabis
research by having their other research
[SPEAKER_00]: being pulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, there's a lot smarter people around
the country at Duke, at Johns Hopkins,
[SPEAKER_00]: at Mass General, who I know personally,
who could do the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my advantages is that that
institute that's behind me is a private
[SPEAKER_00]: institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a CEO of a hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a dean of a university saying
yes or no.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think it could work, we'll do it in
a legitimate process, but we can do the
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the United States, most of the high
quality research is done at academic
[SPEAKER_00]: centers that, unfortunately, some of times
they're unable to do it because of fear
[SPEAKER_00]: and political reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Dr. Meshla, I definitely want
to be mindful of your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're kind enough to come on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I let you go, I want to give
you an opportunity to share with the
[SPEAKER_02]: audience any additional resources or
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you mentioned some studies,
some papers, and I'll definitely put those
[SPEAKER_02]: links in the show description so people
can read more and learn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's other resources sort of like
that, that I could include, please let me
[SPEAKER_02]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also any other other plugs for the
Dent Institute and yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're very happy to see all patients
for all neurological disorders,
[SPEAKER_00]: including cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of good people in this
country doing excellent research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always quote Ethan Rousseau.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he has done extremely work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently had Dustin Sirleck coming into
my office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was kind enough to give me his book,
which I've been reading, which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like to read Dustin Sirleck's
book, I think it's on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really a phenomenal book.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's called The Healer, and I understand
why, meeting him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of good people in this
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what you need to do is just bring
them together, brainstorm what's our next
[SPEAKER_00]: steps at that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will continue my large population
retrospective studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have 800 patients on cannabis
who have a neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people in the audience, many of them
have neuropathies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a very interesting study
I'm putting together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see the results of that,
but my preliminary results are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so there's a lot of good books
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to these meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these meetings are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want the business of cannabis to
support the science of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we have a schism, if we depart
from each other, then it will never be
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted in the medical community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to accept it at medical schools
where they teach it to the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: students.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to look at residency programs
where patients are able to bring their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis into the hospital and not told
you can't bring it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to look at it at the attending
level and at the university levels also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to win them over, but it'll
take time, but it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen because once you're
in the cannabis, you realize the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a panacea, meaning it doesn't
cure everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to watch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as soon as you tell a doctor that
I'm going to treat your cancer with only
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana, their eyes will roll
and they think you're a nutcase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we have to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say that there's scientific proof
that in tissue examples and in animal
[SPEAKER_00]: models, that cannabis has decreased the
size of tumors, but you can't take it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the next level where that's the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I see patients coming from alphas
who have breast cancer, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: treatable disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today who said, no, I don't want
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, just give me cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't treat those patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give them cannabis because it
improves that quality of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have to go through mainstream
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be very cautious and we have
to emphasize to our colleagues that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned Ethan and Dustin Sulak,
who are our fellow advisory board members
[SPEAKER_02]: with yourself for CanMed24.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will be participating in the
medical practicum again for CanMed24.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's any physicians out there
that want to get a world-class education
[SPEAKER_02]: on cannabis medicine, that's the place to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Dr. Metchler, thank you again
for the time and can't wait to see you
[SPEAKER_02]: down in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that Buffalo has bad weather,
but Buffalo has bad weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good talk to you, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
