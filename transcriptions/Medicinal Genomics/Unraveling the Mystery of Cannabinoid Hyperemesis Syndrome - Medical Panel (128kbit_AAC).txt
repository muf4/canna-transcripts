[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, and thanks for sticking around
for the last panel of the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we're going to be talking about
cannabinoid hyperamesis syndrome today.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that has come up in the
media quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: They say there are no deaths from
cannabis, but ultimately this is one of
[SPEAKER_06]: those things where sometimes the
complications of cannabis use can result
[SPEAKER_06]: in death.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is a really sad thing that we see
out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't happen with very many folks,
but it is something that is continuously
[SPEAKER_06]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have some esteemed panelists
here with us today, of course,
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Dorr, who just gave his talk,
and Alice Mood and Tom Folland.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will do a bad job of introducing these
folks properly, so I'm going to let them
[SPEAKER_06]: give their own introductions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Dorr, if you'd like to start.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was so helpful.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Dr. Michael Dorr.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a family physician.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the last six years, I was the
senior medical director of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: program of the Israeli Ministry of Health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for sticking with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty late, so we'll try and make
this short and painless for you and not
[SPEAKER_04]: induce amnesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Tom Folland.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a board-certified diagnostic
radiologist who has established a cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine practice with a focus in
glioblastoma patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm happy to be here to talk to you
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi,
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am Alice Moon, and I have been in the
cannabis industry for eight years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are here right now because I have
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means, basically, cannabis makes me
violently ill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CHS is a condition believed to be a
side effect of frequent and long-term
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the side effects include nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today, I'm going to tell you guys my
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, it'll inspire you guys to
help me find a cure for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been in the industry for eight
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was working on a dispensary in
2015, I was writing product reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would consume edibles and write about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was having about 10 milligrams of
edibles a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, in 2016, I started growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at first, it was pretty random.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every few months, I would write about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I would just puke and couldn't figure
out why.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And doctors couldn't figure out why
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said I had acid reflux.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I changed my diet, kept getting worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I stopped drinking alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I wasn't drinking a good
amount, I thought, maybe that has
[SPEAKER_02]: something to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't have alcohol for two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during that time, I was getting worse
and worse to the point where, in 2018,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was starting to throw up almost every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a specialist who said, it's
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't want to believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure most of you don't want to believe
it, because we know that cannabis helps
[SPEAKER_02]: with nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how could something that helps us with
so much also do damage?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, OK, I'll take a cannabis break.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, I'm going to have my last
hurrah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to a five-course infused dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that triggered my first episode of 14
days of nonstop throwing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All day, every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, at this time, I knew nothing about
CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt like I was dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted it to end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just throwing up over and over and
over and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a sip of water, I was throwing it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the interesting thing with this
syndrome is the one thing that stops the
[SPEAKER_02]: throwing up is hot baths or capsaicin
cream on your stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's a cayenne pepper-based cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I first tried this cream, not knowing
what it was, put it all over my stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my skin was on fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was in excruciating pain,
but I wasn't throwing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, OK, what do I want?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want to have my skin on fire or do I
want to be puking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, I chose the puking,
because it was too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then I was in the bathtub and
trying out the bathtub route.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that helped a lot, but it dehydrated
me as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second I would get out of the tub,
I was throwing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I slept in my bathroom on my bathroom
floor for many of nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: My roommate would come home and check to
make sure I was even alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I passed out in my front yard one day
because I was throwing up so much that I
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't hug the toilet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a neighbor stopped by and said,
can I help you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just broke down and cried and said,
I wish you could.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish somebody could help me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how anyone can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt like I was dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone around me was extremely scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost 15 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then I quit using cannabis for
three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, people were saying they thought that
this was pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after taking a three-month break,
I said, OK, let me use pesticide-free
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tried that, and it came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That time, it only lasted four days,
so not as terrible, but still not very
[SPEAKER_02]: pleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then after that, people were saying,
CBD, try CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure CBD will work for you,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it has the opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll totally work.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I tried CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that ended up triggering my worst
episode yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on December 22.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't get to enjoy Christmas or New
Year's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw up all day every day for 16 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had two urgent care visits, one at-home
nurse visit, and ultimately was in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hospital and was in there for four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my ER doctor didn't even know the
difference between THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that fucking ridiculous?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, excuse my language, but that is
absolutely ridiculous that an ER doctor
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't know the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can't even know that cannabinoid
hyperemesis is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that process, I got two ulcers,
a hernia, and a bacteria infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm proud to say that I've gained 30
pounds since my hospitalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that really speaks volume to
how much weight I lost in the beginning of
[SPEAKER_02]: the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was extremely scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was near death.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want anyone else to go through
what I went through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's pretty crazy is I was looking
to see, when was the last time I had THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: When was that last episode?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that September 24 of last
year was actually the last time I had THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's pretty serendipitous that
right now is my one-year anniversary of no
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I want to be clear that I was like
one of you before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love weed so, so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is my whole entire world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a publicist in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I got sick, I was going to three to
five events a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I can't even be around secondhand
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I am determined to find a cure for
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's researching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want us to figure it out so no one
else has to get this sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can smoke weed again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to preface this with thank
[SPEAKER_06]: you, Alice, also for sharing that story.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really kind of gives some color to what
we're dealing with out there in terms of
[SPEAKER_06]: this condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to mention that there is not a
lot known about this condition currently.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will advise that not all the
panelists have every single answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to do our best to tackle
it today with this discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess I'll start with the first
question I have.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first cases of this started to
emerge in around 2004.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's taken a while for the medical
community to actually acknowledge and
[SPEAKER_06]: recognize this condition in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping to get some insights from
our panelists as far as why you think that
[SPEAKER_06]: is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it that the medical community has
taken so long to actually recognize this
[SPEAKER_06]: condition?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again to Alice for sharing her
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a lot of courage to come to a
conference like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where basically people are celebrating a
certain thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've had this terrible experience
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to kind of confirm what she's
saying, I remember as a first year
[SPEAKER_04]: resident in Chicago was the first time I
ever heard of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had graduated medical school.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to Alice's point, had never even heard
of such a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember at Cook County in Chicago
where I was doing my training,
[SPEAKER_04]: the ER doctors ordered a CT scan.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, ah, it's going to be
negative.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see this kid every few months.
[SPEAKER_04]: He smokes cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: CT scans never show anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the tax payers are picking
up that bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's picking up all that radiation for
something that we now know to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: screen for and look for in patients coming
in who endorse a history of chronic
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis use with this nausea and
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to Kyle's question, the first case is
showing up in 2004.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was from Alan et al in Australia in a
case of nine patients who endorsed a
[SPEAKER_04]: history very similar to what Alice has
talked to us about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And upon cessation of cannabis,
I believe seven of those patients had
[SPEAKER_04]: complete recovery.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this was the first time this began
percolating to the surface of the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean that we haven't had cases
of CHS or so-called CHS at least prior to
[SPEAKER_04]: 2004?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it does not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, in radiology, we have a
very famous saying which says,
[SPEAKER_04]: the eye does not see what the mind does
not know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you could be looking at patients all
day long who are throwing up, if you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know that there's an entity called
cannabis hyperemesis syndrome which
[SPEAKER_04]: involves TRPV1 receptors that we'll get
into and CB1 receptors, you're not going
[SPEAKER_04]: to even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be on your radar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another point we'll get into is
there's this second entity called CVS.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there's very non-confusing CVS,
CHS, cyclical vomiting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: These patients will typically have the
exact same presentation, nausea,
[SPEAKER_04]: vomiting, abdominal pain, except that a
good percentage of them as well will also
[SPEAKER_04]: endorse a history of migraine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tend to be more female than male,
which is the opposite with CHS.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we don't quite see the striking
use of a hot water bathing that we do see
[SPEAKER_04]: in CVS.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the reason I'm mentioning these are
with CHS.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point being that there's an awful
lot of overlap.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in fact, one of the latest papers I
read from May of this year actually thinks
[SPEAKER_04]: that CHS may be a particular subset of
CVS.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so just bringing this up in the
context of this question, because CVS was
[SPEAKER_04]: known before 2004.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think these are some of the factors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe a final factor that people
like to talk about is this increasing
[SPEAKER_04]: potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: We now have concentrates and other forms
of cannabis that are 90% THC and beyond.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that perhaps this bombarding receptors
over time at this level could potentially
[SPEAKER_04]: account for the increase in prevalence of
these cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also people are now admitting to their
doctors that they're using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are afraid to talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So doctors wouldn't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that states are legalizing,
and cannabis is a hot topic, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: emergency room doctors in Colorado,
they know about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're documenting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been cases of this all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have talked to thousands of people with
CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: All over the world, people have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just no one's keeping track of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one's really putting forward the
effort to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the same as my colleagues.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried since the morning to check the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was given a number, which was a
surprise to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had almost between 200 to 300 cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean all the hospitals together in
Israel.
[SPEAKER_08]: But let me refer to something because I
would like to see things in larger scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is only one of the syndromes
connected to cannabis that are
[SPEAKER_08]: underreported.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have a good report system about
side effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then when we don't have the system,
we cannot publish results.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the physician does not know about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the beginning should be teaching
physicians and teaching them again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to build upon Dr. Doerr's points,
it's a great point.
[SPEAKER_04]: How we gather the data and how we're
characterizing things is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we say someone's a heavy user,
what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that four times a week?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that twice a week?
[SPEAKER_04]: These things matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so another point that I'll raise is
that the current Bible of gastroenterology
[SPEAKER_04]: is known as the Rome Four.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in psychiatry, we have the DSM-5.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is the Bible and that contains
cannabis use disorder.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Rome Four contains CHS, cannabinoid
hyperemesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even that is an imperfect tool for
use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this paper that I just read from May
of this year suggests improvement upon
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that when a patient has stopped using
cannabis for a period of six months and
[SPEAKER_04]: has had complete cessation of these
symptoms, they're proposing that we use
[SPEAKER_04]: that six month period.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Rome Four didn't give any time
period.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a patient could stop for a month and
not have any symptoms and then go back on
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and then have symptoms again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the point is that even with this
entity, how we're diagnosing it and who
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to include is evolving all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as well it should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the major point is that if you've
been off for a month, that actually isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: long enough to be able to tell if you're
going to have another cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the proposal is that even the Rome Four
criteria aren't good enough that we need
[SPEAKER_04]: to be iterating on that and editing as we
go along.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to follow up with what Dr. Dorges
said, since this morning when he just did
[SPEAKER_02]: a few simple phone calls, he discovered
that there's 300 people in Israel that
[SPEAKER_02]: they have documented.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am at the end of this presentation where
you are going to be going over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have talked to 200 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've talked to thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have statistics from 200 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will be going over the data that I
have collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this just shows how widespread this
really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot bigger of a deal than we're
currently acknowledging it to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we spoke a lot here about basically
what are the issues in terms of how people
[SPEAKER_06]: are identifying this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So because there seems to be this kind of
confusion among practitioners as far as
[SPEAKER_06]: how to actually make this diagnosis,
what would you say would be the best
[SPEAKER_06]: approach to actually make a confirmed
diagnosis of CHS?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of spoke about it in my prior
answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll go to it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: A modified version of the Rome Four is the
best criteria we currently have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that requires that you have a history
of using cannabis for at least one year,
[SPEAKER_04]: that what they're defining heavy use or
frequent use is greater than four times
[SPEAKER_04]: per week.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't give a defined time period for
cessation of cannabis and resolution of
[SPEAKER_04]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what Ben Casathon, I believe the paper
is from, from May of this year,
[SPEAKER_04]: is proposing is that you wait for a period
of six months after a cessation of use or
[SPEAKER_04]: three cycles of hyperemesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that patient would on average go
into a hyperametic phase every five weeks,
[SPEAKER_04]: then at 15 weeks after cessation of use,
you could now apply that diagnosis
[SPEAKER_04]: retrospectively.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason this is very important,
if we want to get the point out that
[SPEAKER_04]: someone shouldn't be walking into the
emergency room saying, I use cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm throwing up and I get relief from
showers, and then having that label
[SPEAKER_04]: applied to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what they're finding is that a
good percentage of patients who have CVS,
[SPEAKER_04]: the cyclical vomiting syndrome and
psychogenic vomiting and other forms of
[SPEAKER_04]: nausea and vomiting also find relief from
hot bathing, not at the high percentages
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're seeing being reported in
association with CHS, but certainly it is
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I want to harp on that six month
and or three cycles of hyperemesis that
[SPEAKER_04]: from the time you've stopped.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that brings us to our next caveat.
[SPEAKER_04]: CVS patients and CHS patients up until
they develop these symptoms or see CVS
[SPEAKER_04]: patients use cannabis actually to treat
their cyclical vomiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they don't want to stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so trying to tell these people to stop
for a period of six months, what ends up
[SPEAKER_04]: happening is they don't stop and maybe
they don't tell their doctor about it
[SPEAKER_04]: because they don't want their doctor to
get angry at them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this paper then goes on to talk
about how if the patient doesn't stop and
[SPEAKER_04]: has used for greater than a year and has
used greater than four times a week that a
[SPEAKER_04]: tentative diagnosis of CHS can be applied
in that case.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I will point out that this
paper was very much in one case series
[SPEAKER_04]: where they looked at when they applied
Rome for criteria retrospectively,
[SPEAKER_04]: they found that a good percentage of
patients who had been labeled with CHS in
[SPEAKER_04]: the emergency room no longer fit the
criteria for that diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was actually just one more
consultation I did today was I asked
[SPEAKER_08]: Professor Mashollam about is our guru and
his answer was give such a patient more
[SPEAKER_08]: THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said I wouldn't dare.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the godfather of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just he knows so much,
but this is something that people don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't know about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have a chat with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he's back on a plane to Israel,
but we're going to have to have a chat for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the next question that you were
going to go over was the treatment once
[SPEAKER_06]: people get this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, we've made a diagnosis now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are the first lines of treatment
that you would actually propose to give to
[SPEAKER_06]: someone who has been formerly diagnosed
with CHS?
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So capsaicin cream on the stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That relieves the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that relieves symptoms for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the anti-psychotic medicine,
Haldol, that has had a high success rate
[SPEAKER_02]: of stopping the nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the side effects of it are so severe
that the people I've spoken with have all
[SPEAKER_02]: said they would rather be vomiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's an anti-psychotic,
it has caused a lot of anxiety,
[SPEAKER_02]: hallucinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't understand what's going on
with them because most of the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: doctors aren't explaining the medicine
that they're giving to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all of a sudden, someone's going
through this feeling of psychosis in the
[SPEAKER_02]: emergency room, and they don't know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, the only thing is for people to
stop using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But an IV and capsaicin, and that would be
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Alice brings up a great point with
capsaicin.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, some people, you figure this
could kind of be diagnostic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you come into the emergency room,
you endorse a history of cyclical
[SPEAKER_04]: vomiting, and using cannabis, and they rub
a little on your chest and abdomen.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you start to get better, they shouldn't
apply the diagnosis right then and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's kind of presumptive a little bit
because, as we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: probably in a little bit, the receptor
where we were initially focused on was
[SPEAKER_04]: CB1.
[SPEAKER_04]: As things have evolved, and we've learned
more about this need for nociceptive heat
[SPEAKER_04]: above 41 to 43 degrees centigrade,
and are the use of capsaicin, we focus on
[SPEAKER_04]: the so-called capsaicin receptor,
TRPV1.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why that can be helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in some patients, it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why Alice mentioned, why would we
give an antipsychotic such as haloperidol,
[SPEAKER_04]: common name is Haldol, because guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Andancetron, our 5-HT3 drug that works
for our chemotherapy patients,
[SPEAKER_04]: famously does not work in this case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reglan, our metaclopramide, which is
another medication that we will use for
[SPEAKER_04]: various patients with nausea and vomiting,
also doesn't work universally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, in an emergency room, your average ED
physician are going to try and go to these
[SPEAKER_04]: things before they go to haloperidol,
typically, because haloperidol can cause
[SPEAKER_04]: tardive dyskinesia, that famous lip
smacking and other things that Dr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mishulam talked about yesterday in his
talk on schizophrenia, where he was
[SPEAKER_04]: saying, hey, we could use CBD in many of
these patients and avoid these nasty side
[SPEAKER_04]: effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the other issue being that
some patients develop this tardive
[SPEAKER_04]: dyskinesia from the very first
administration.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ER doctors don't take it lightly to
administer this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other thing that I will mention is
that haloperidol works so well that when
[SPEAKER_04]: it stops the nausea and vomiting,
in this case as well, that's another sign
[SPEAKER_04]: that that's potentially what we're looking
at.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, bear in mind that six months,
three cycles before you're applying that
[SPEAKER_04]: label, which will now stay with that
patient for life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, sorry, I should also say
biggest things, basically, in medicine,
[SPEAKER_04]: get fluid into these patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are throwing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the initial treatment in the emergency
room is IV fluids, sometimes
[SPEAKER_04]: benzodiazepines to sedate the patient,
to take them away from this hellish
[SPEAKER_04]: experience they're having, getting fluids
into them, stopping the emesis by any of
[SPEAKER_04]: the methods that we can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've mentioned 5-HT3.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've mentioned dopamine antagonists,
haloperidol.
[SPEAKER_04]: So emesis is a very complex mechanism.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will try any and all of our drugs
to show that we can shut it down and
[SPEAKER_04]: prevent patients from going into acute
renal failure, which has happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And acute renal failure kills you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just so you know, there have been
deaths from CHS, but we can get towards
[SPEAKER_02]: that towards the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: You mentioned that in the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wonder, the deaths from CHS must be
because of dehydration.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I find it hard to believe in the 21st
surgery, a medicine does not know to treat
[SPEAKER_08]: dehydration unless those patients didn't
come to the hospital, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the problem, Dr. Doerr,
and this was Alex Berenson, who I'm sure
[SPEAKER_04]: is known and loved to all of us in this
room, recently, our last week was
[SPEAKER_04]: publishing a case from Indiana where a
young guy had died with this presumptive
[SPEAKER_04]: diagnosis of CHS.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it gets to a point I talked about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: When people associate cannabis with
anti-AIDS, the emesis, you coming along
[SPEAKER_04]: and telling them that this very thing
they're using is called, he didn't believe
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his own mother was there crying.
[SPEAKER_04]: He kept on using and he didn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he tried stopping, but he went back to
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, you know, I don't want to blame
patients here, but we're all humans and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's human nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why it's important that we're
having these discussions and raising this
[SPEAKER_04]: awareness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And absolutely in the 21st century to
think that someone dies from dehydration.
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, this is what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and some, you know, some people
are afraid to even go to the hospital and
[SPEAKER_02]: some people can't afford to even go to the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my urgent care visits were
expensive and I have insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this syndrome has cost me a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to change the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're here, Dr. Doerr.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to change it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do want to ask about, so treatment,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we talked about different drugs that
can be used to treat it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're also hoping to understand what
can we use otherwise as supplements,
[SPEAKER_06]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What other activities can we use to
mitigate the symptoms of CHS?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also, are there any types of
triggers that you've noticed?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we know cannabis is a trigger
and not just limited to THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: As Alice mentioned, she also had an
episode with CBD and there may be other
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids implicated as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But specifically what kind of triggers are
out there?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also what other types of
strategies have you been using to
[SPEAKER_06]: mitigate?
[SPEAKER_06]: Aside from the drugs that Tom had
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one interesting thing is running
helps a lot of people stop throwing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's one reported case of somebody
getting rhabdomyolysis from running for 15
[SPEAKER_02]: hours straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 hours, but he wasn't throwing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I thought that was pretty alarming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I reached out to my network
of people with CHS and we'll go over the
[SPEAKER_02]: stats later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But 20 people out of the 200, found relief
from running.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is another thing that people have
found relief from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are taking vitamins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally, I don't have any,
like, I just, I don't use cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of how I try to deal with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just got to say, just to build on
what Alice is saying, in case any of you
[SPEAKER_04]: are wondering, well, how could running,
how does running tie into this?
[SPEAKER_04]: This all gets back to the TRPV receptor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they think is going on here is a
huge butaneous steel syndrome,
[SPEAKER_04]: where basically you're having dysfunction
with CB1 receptors at the level of the
[SPEAKER_04]: bowel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you put yourself under a hot
shower and get that 41 to 43 degree
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature, hitting the TRPV receptors,
which have been desensitized, they now
[SPEAKER_04]: open up and allow you to feel anti-emesis
or a normal level of just functioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: But interestingly, when the patients run,
you're doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I should have said there is when
you're in the shower, all of your blood is
[SPEAKER_04]: flowing to your skin to release heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pulled away from the bowel.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think that the mechanism underlying
the running is that when these patients
[SPEAKER_04]: are running, all of their blood is now
going to their muscles and not to the
[SPEAKER_04]: bowel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's cutaneous steel or enteric steel
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, this is all hypothesis,
but this is the current best understanding
[SPEAKER_04]: of why this occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as triggers, well, there's
quite a few foods that people can eat if
[SPEAKER_02]: they have CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not every one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, these foods don't affect me,
but black pepper, coffee, and chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have naturally occurring cannabinoids
in them, and it can trigger someone to
[SPEAKER_02]: have an episode of CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people literally cannot touch black
pepper at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now imagine trying to go out to eat at a
restaurant and trying to ensure that your
[SPEAKER_02]: food doesn't have black pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think those are the most popular
foods that are the triggers for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any others?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, and of course, that makes sense just
with beta carofalin, having cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: activity in black pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Alice pointed out, that
cannabinoids and cannabinoid-like
[SPEAKER_04]: substances in chocolate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Alice had mentioned, you had mentioned
that basically some of these episodes were
[SPEAKER_06]: up to 16 days for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so even after cessating any type of
cannabis smoke or ingestion, those
[SPEAKER_06]: symptoms still continue to persist.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm wondering, why is it that it takes
so long for these symptoms to clear up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys have any insights as to why
that might be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think you can say it better than I
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stays in your system.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a half-life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the same reason that you can get pulled
over by a cop after not having smoked for
[SPEAKER_04]: three and a half weeks, and now you have
to submit to a UTOX, and now it turns out
[SPEAKER_04]: positive, is the exact same reason that
they hypothesize this occurs for many
[SPEAKER_04]: months or sometimes after cessation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why they want you to go to that full
six-month period or three cycles before
[SPEAKER_04]: applying this diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lipophilic nature of cannabinoids and
cannabinoid metabolites, and that these
[SPEAKER_04]: are being leached into the system at a
quantity sufficient to continue to cause
[SPEAKER_04]: illness in these patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is actually a question that I'm
very curious to hear the panelists'
[SPEAKER_06]: insights about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks on the internet seem to be
convinced that CHS is caused by the use of
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticides on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically, they've identified neem oil
as a potential causal agent of CHS.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you all agree with this idea?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if so, why or why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neem oil does not cause cannabinoid
hyperemesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know we're not supposed to say
anything with confidence, because this is
[SPEAKER_02]: still, you know, we're researching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've talked to people who have grown
their own cannabis, and they have CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried pesticide-free weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: The symptoms are similar, but they're not
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pesticide poisoning does, you know,
it can cause nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But pesticide poisoning can also cause
seizures and issues with vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not pesticide poisoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had an episode from hemp-derived CBD
that I know was grown without pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a family physician, and I like things
to be simple.
[SPEAKER_08]: You say kiss.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care what is the exact reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will treat the patient the same way,
intravenously, and some things against the
[SPEAKER_08]: nausea.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that point, if the emergency ward
was a family or as a primary care
[SPEAKER_08]: physician, I don't care what was the exact
reason in the receptors.
[SPEAKER_08]: The treatment will be the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would just add that we actually
also have cases of CHS occurring in
[SPEAKER_04]: patients using synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anyone in the room who may not be
familiar, one of the reasons patients may
[SPEAKER_04]: choose to use synthetic cannabinoids,
they may have jobs which require them to
[SPEAKER_04]: get urine tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fifty percent of all jobs in the United
States require pre-employment urine
[SPEAKER_04]: screening, which is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an entire industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But suffice it to say that we have seen
CHS in those patients using these agonists
[SPEAKER_04]: at CB1 receptors that may be even more
potent in THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have cases going back to 2013,
2014 from England and elsewhere around the
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also to Alice's point, I know of many
cases, not many cases, but quite a few
[SPEAKER_04]: where people were growers themselves and
didn't use neem oil and still developed
[SPEAKER_04]: this syndrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, to Alice's point,
Dr. Ethan Russo as well has spoken about
[SPEAKER_04]: this and how he really doesn't think it's
the neem oil because as Alice pointed out,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not identical.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not how neem oil poisoning
presents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we have seen it, it doesn't
persist for this period.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we have seen this both in cases
where neem oil has not been used on the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and in synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So moving towards how we get answers and
start to pick apart this a bit more,
[SPEAKER_06]: one approach that's been suggested to try
and further investigate this is to
[SPEAKER_06]: sequence patient populations with CHS.
[SPEAKER_06]: So are there any different targets that
you think researchers might be interested
[SPEAKER_06]: in sequencing to help tease apart what
genetic underpinnings might be present in
[SPEAKER_06]: this condition?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've discussed these beforehand,
so I apologize for hogging the mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: But two things we know, in CVS patients,
not CHS patients, we have found a gene,
[SPEAKER_04]: the RYR2 gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And given that I just mentioned at the
outset of the talk that we think
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially CHS may even be a subset of
CVS, we will certainly want to look at
[SPEAKER_04]: that and see if that's a commonality
amongst these individuals who are
[SPEAKER_04]: reporting this entity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also the cytochrome P450 enzymes that
break down THC and its metabolites,
[SPEAKER_04]: are they somehow different?
[SPEAKER_04]: In this group, are they slower
metabolizers perhaps?
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all targets that we would
certainly want to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So moving to some of the symptoms and what
we see out there, what we're noticing is
[SPEAKER_06]: that hormonal fluctuations in women seem
to also worsen the symptoms of their CHS.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have any insights as to what is
going on here, why this is the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: Letting the doctor take this one again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Dort, do you want to add anything on
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, not everyone has the answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Overall, I have expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we just know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that when women are getting their
menstrual cycle is when they're having the
[SPEAKER_02]: most severe symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a reoccurring pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I had my worst case of CHS,
it was during my menstrual cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, do you know any suggestions?
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about, again, it's going to be
along the hypothesis thing where we do
[SPEAKER_04]: know there's involvement of the HPA,
the hypothalmic pituitary access.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hypothalamus is involved in
thermoregulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We think that's gone askew.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to do with the fact that even every
month, women's migraines, their
[SPEAKER_04]: fibromyalgia, all of these things may be
worse in the perimenstrual period relating
[SPEAKER_04]: to the effect of estrogen and progesterone
fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're, again, hypothesizing that this is
having some effect on our homeostatic
[SPEAKER_04]: system, our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, this is all just hypothesis at
this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Dustin Sulak had just mentioned,
in a prior case, we don't have great data
[SPEAKER_04]: yet on cannabinoids and the sex
differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is certainly an area ripe for
exploration and investigation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of data, Alice has been very
active in the community on social media.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she actually runs a couple of
different groups to support CHS patients
[SPEAKER_06]: and people who are going through the
condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's actually collected, she's done
patient surveys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's actually gotten response from now
200 patients with CHS.
[SPEAKER_06]: All through Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a couple other sources.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if it was just limited.
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, Power of Social Media alluded to
this earlier in my Heavy Metals talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really useful tool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're going to go through some of
those in just a minute here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Alice, I will let you click through the
slides here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that should take you.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, that is, yeah, I've collected data
from 200 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, a lot of these people, they find me
because I'm doing interviews a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have spoken with business insider,
Leafly, Rolling Stone, and a few smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: publications as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these people, they find me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hear about my story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I recommend these Facebook
groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's people who run other Facebook
groups as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just me doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't handle all the emotional labor,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are other people that are helping
do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so out of the thousands of people in
these groups, I've collected data from 200
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so 75 people were using cannabis for
eight years before the symptoms began.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a high amount of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you can see from that, it kind of
varies of how long people were using.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, musical chair so I can see better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I want to point out with
this data is there's no consistency with
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So out of how much people consumed,
55% used it multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: 27% used it actually all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some people used it daily and
small amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Used it once a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the age of consumers varied with 50
patients aged 21 to 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was a variety of other
ages.
[SPEAKER_02]: But 21 to 25 was the majority of the 200
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then location.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are all these people that I'm
talking to?
[SPEAKER_02]: California had the highest amount of
people, 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up was Canada, 13%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then New York, Florida, Washington,
and Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's small cases reported
throughout all the states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in Italy and the United Kingdom
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we are seeing these stats
because this is where people are figuring
[SPEAKER_02]: out that they have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are states that are legalizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people are figuring it out versus
the illegal states that it's not talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people aren't using high-potency THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not using as often due to lack of
being able to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the methods of using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The highest amount of people were using a
bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were smoking out of a bong,
joints, blunts, in a pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smaller amount were using edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: 65 people out of the 200 were using vape
pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 61 were using dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of all over the place of how
people were using before they got CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up, the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, almost everyone out of the
200 had nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then following that is the rest of the
symptoms that were occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vomiting, abdominal pain, some body pain,
diarrhea, dehydration.
[SPEAKER_02]: The list goes on of awful things that
people experience with this syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What provided relief?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot baths and the hot showers worked for
157 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Capsaicin cream for 43.
[SPEAKER_02]: IV was very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heating pads and ultimately sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people were able to just sleep
through this and try to get relief that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The length of symptoms after stopping
cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_02]: 22% went more than a month of still
experiencing symptoms before they got
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine you stop using the one thing
that you think helps you with all of your
[SPEAKER_02]: nausea and all of your pain and you stop
using it and you're not getting better.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a month, you're going to think it's
not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people end up going back to using it
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next, when asked if running provided
relief, 10%, 20 out of the 200 find relief
[SPEAKER_02]: from running.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is something we hadn't
talked about yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gallbladders being unnecessarily removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since doctors don't know about this,
they're misdiagnosing people and people
[SPEAKER_02]: are having organs removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: 16 people out of 200 had their
gallbladders removed and didn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then ultimately discovered that this
was cannabis making them sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: 16 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another 16 people, their doctor
suggested that they have their gallbladder
[SPEAKER_02]: removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is out of just 200 people that
I've spoken to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine how many people have had surgery
that they didn't even need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-existing conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something that I find very
interesting is 48.5% of the people who
[SPEAKER_02]: have CHS had anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them were using cannabis for
anxiety and depression as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people did have pre-existing
conditions and I think this might have
[SPEAKER_02]: something to do with this that our genes
are, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: The gut is the second brain, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: There is more serotonin in the gut than
there is the brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that could certainly play into this
because of course we know serotonin is
[SPEAKER_06]: very implicated in anxiety.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let you continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people might be on medicine as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know how medicine reacts with
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's not enough research at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So medicine and the interaction could also
play a part in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in summary, more research needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: More research needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the point of having this
discussion is so we can bring more
[SPEAKER_06]: awareness to this topic so that people do
start to investigate this a bit further.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give a thanks to our panelists
for their participation today.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sharing their knowledge with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I'd like to open the floor to any
questions you might have for myself or the
[SPEAKER_06]: panelists.
[SPEAKER_07]: So where are we on the sequencing of
receptors in this family such as TRIP-A1,
[SPEAKER_07]: TRIP-V1, CB1, CB2, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we seeing potential polymorphisms in
those in this population?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be quite honest, that work hasn't been
done yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we're hoping to,
you know, I was actually approached no
[SPEAKER_04]: later than today to get involved in a
project that will be hopefully looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: these very things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just getting around to it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really the TRIP-V1 receptor and to
your point, the TRPA receptor hadn't been
[SPEAKER_04]: looked at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until recently, people were thinking this
was all to do with CB1.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the past couple of years,
as the TRPV issue has become more
[SPEAKER_04]: prominent, given the capsaicin,
the showering baths, the running,
[SPEAKER_04]: now they're just beginning to look at
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly that's the next work to be
done.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a whole vocabulary list of
these TRIP receptors, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That were very much in vogue a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: They kind of, you know, the neurobiology
field has moved on because it was
[SPEAKER_07]: well-exploited.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the cannabis field now that needs to
come into focus with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as I said, there's a large vocabulary
list of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't necessarily just stop at A1 and
V1.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the endocannabinoid system is
exceptionally complex and there's so many
[SPEAKER_04]: things you could focus on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think these are good starting points
and certainly to look at the rest of the
[SPEAKER_04]: TRP receptors as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd also like to point out,
I'm pretty sure this is the first DHS
[SPEAKER_02]: panel to ever happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't a topic that is talked about at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we are just now starting the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just two quick statistics I'll throw
out at you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The overall incidence in Colorado of
seeing patients present for nausea and
[SPEAKER_04]: vomiting is 0.07%.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a small issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to put it in context, but it's a very
important issue, particularly if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: the person suffering from it or you know
someone suffering from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing to point out is after the
legalization of cannabis in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_04]: the following year they saw an 8% increase
in presentations to the emergency room for
[SPEAKER_04]: nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, it's only 0.07% of all of their
visits, but they did see that uptick.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we owe it to ourselves to
remain intellectually curious and to ask
[SPEAKER_04]: these hard questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the TRPV1 receptors are involved,
is anybody looking into using CVDA to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: the symptoms?
[SPEAKER_02]: So no one is looking into anything with
CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just make that clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one is doing research at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada has allocated $250,000 towards the
research of CHS, but that is not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: start until next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one is putting too much focus on this
because there's other things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the industry and people don't think
that this is a widespread problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we think it has something to do
with the TRPV1 receptor, we can't speak
[SPEAKER_02]: with certainty.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will add, I'm aware of a friend of mine
in Canada who's looking very closely at
[SPEAKER_04]: the TRP family of receptors and at this
thing with Alice's point, this is more
[SPEAKER_04]: nascent knowledge and a more nascent
direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly there are people already
beginning to look at this quite heavily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because mechanistically it explains what's
going on much better than the CB1
[SPEAKER_04]: predominant theory, which didn't explain
why only certain subsets of patients
[SPEAKER_04]: develop this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are patients who will use cannabis
every day of their life and will never
[SPEAKER_04]: develop this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're really interested in finding
out is who is the cohort?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it that certain people and with
regard to CVDA as well, I think the
[SPEAKER_04]: patients after they go back and try CBD
and have this 16-day protracted period of
[SPEAKER_04]: throwing up are so like, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't be a guinea pig anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't be a guinea pig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried and I almost died.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Two questions actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: One about sedation.
[SPEAKER_09]: You mentioned that that helped,
or at least sleeping helped.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think sedation over a period of
time actually decreases the length of the
[SPEAKER_09]: attack?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do you have a clue?
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'm not sure I understand
completely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you mean to put a patient because of
vomiting under full anesthesia and to live
[SPEAKER_08]: in there for several days or weeks?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm not quite sure how the sedation
comment that the other doctor made works
[SPEAKER_09]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I presume that as you sedate the
person, at some point they stop vomiting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now there's degrees of sedation and
all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: My question was more along the lines of if
sleep helps and sleeping pills or
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever, does it actually, or do you
think it could compress and kind of lessen
[SPEAKER_09]: the severity of the attacks?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like 16 days might shorten to whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Potentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically you're asking if someone comes
in and we have a hundred patients and we
[SPEAKER_04]: sedate them, we sedate them with some
benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is their length of protracted vomiting
shortened, somehow improved by the
[SPEAKER_04]: sleeping?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone has really looked at
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly something to keep in mind,
and I will, something that just came to
[SPEAKER_04]: mind as I was talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Ryan Marino, who's a pretty
prominent toxicologist, emergency room
[SPEAKER_04]: physician, and other physicians have
recently started proposing keeping a
[SPEAKER_04]: registry on cannabis given how much of the
United States has now legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So toxicologists who are emergency
medicine fellowship trained experts in
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs are now going to be keeping a
database and asking the same questions
[SPEAKER_04]: every time so that hopefully in five years
from now we will have much more dynamic
[SPEAKER_04]: data.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: The second question had to do with at what
level, once you had an attack,
[SPEAKER_09]: what level stimulates another,
like micro doses, for instance,
[SPEAKER_09]: at what level does that kick off an
attack?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Alice mentioned that just
secondhand smoke would do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody have a clue about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it varies from person to person.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no consistency for, you know,
I was just consuming like five,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 milligrams a day, maybe smoking half a
joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me that's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: To someone else that might be considered a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as using again and getting
symptoms again, it completely varies for
[SPEAKER_02]: each person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually after taking a break, people can
consume a little bit over, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a few months and then the symptoms come
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people do try to use it lightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, also lightly depends on who,
what they think, but there is no
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the slides that was included
analysis talk today, but I certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: encourage you when she releases all of it
to check it out because it's really
[SPEAKER_04]: fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in that, one of the slides that wasn't
shown, 50% of those 200 patients were able
[SPEAKER_04]: to go back and use cannabinoid products
again, at least per their reporting.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much of that was true?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it really 50%?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it more like 30%?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other 20% did get sick,
but they didn't tell us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least 50% are saying that they were
able to introduce cannabis or cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: after a certain period of cessation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then where the money is, what was that
period of cessation?
[SPEAKER_04]: What were they using?
[SPEAKER_04]: What did their genetics look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they really have CHS?
[SPEAKER_04]: Were they a CVS cohort that stopped for a
period and were given that diagnosis?
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are all fascinating questions,
but even in talking to other pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: prominent cannabis clinicians at this
event, they have noted the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would also make the point that some
people believe this only occurs to
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational users who dab and whatnot,
and that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also see this in some medical patients
who may only be using for as little as a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of years in some cases before this
develops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to follow up on that, so you said
people do go back to using, but from my
[SPEAKER_02]: data, people after taking a break,
did the symptoms come back?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 50% of people who started using
again, their symptoms did come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 50%, just to clarify that, 50% of
people who took a break and then started
[SPEAKER_02]: using got their symptoms again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's 100 people out of 200.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that also raised the question
that the other 50% may have been cyclical
[SPEAKER_04]: vomiting syndrome where they went and
smoked again and they didn't have the
[SPEAKER_04]: issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of what this latest paper
by Vin Kathasan is getting at,
[SPEAKER_04]: that we really want to be careful here in
disentangling these two entities and in
[SPEAKER_04]: prospectively applying this label of CHS.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just about one point, you asked about
secondhand smoking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe that will give the patient
enough amount to influence, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you and I can go sit in a room and
you can smoke a joint and watch how sick I
[SPEAKER_02]: get the next day because it can make me
throw up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to a Snoop Dogg concert and that
was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I encourage you to smoke a joint around
me so you can see what happens because I
[SPEAKER_02]: am that sensitive to it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And trust me, I wish this wasn't true
because I love cannabis so much and I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't go to these events.
[SPEAKER_08]: I disagree at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe there are some sensitive persons,
individuals.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always been like that, but mostly
secondhand smoking is not effective,
[SPEAKER_08]: no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Young from San Francisco Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a patient who was pretty much a
recreational user.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I inherited him actually, but he also
suffered a traumatic brain injury about a
[SPEAKER_01]: year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been a little liberal as far
as not kind of use on his use,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because it had sort of
alleviated a lot of his anxiety and
[SPEAKER_01]: insomnia symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the last three weeks, actually
almost a month, he's been waking up every
[SPEAKER_01]: morning with this exact same syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've urine tested him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've quantified his cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've checked, you know, all the usual
stuff, you know, including thinking it
[SPEAKER_01]: might be a gallbladder, very unusual for a
young 19 year old man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess my question is, what would you
suggest that algorithmically or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in a differential where I go
with this at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he needs to take a break
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think something I didn't
touch on was the fact that I have had
[SPEAKER_02]: every test done on my body possible to
make sure that nothing else was wrong with
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I encourage you to look into other
things too and not go straight to its
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have been poked and prodded over and
over and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way I knew it wasn't anything else
that was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is prevalence of it being in the
morning when people get the worst
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think we touch base on that
question, but it is a very common thing
[SPEAKER_02]: with people who have CHS to feel it the
worst right when they wake up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tom, do you want to go into explaining
that or just?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cortisol.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so when it's time to get up in the
morning, the sun coming through your
[SPEAKER_04]: window causes your body to produce
cortisol.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's why we see more heart attacks.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the morning, we think this is going to
be due to a leaching effect from the
[SPEAKER_04]: release of cortisol, basically causing the
leach of whatever retained metabolites and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids are in the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, just hypothesis, but that would be
the leading hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, he needs to take a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs to cease cannabis use for a bit
to see if it was that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if he continues to use,
then it could get worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just saying from what I've seen
that it's best just to take a break.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I would talk about,
which is mentioned in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: literature in wanting to bring this entity
to the public's consciousness,
[SPEAKER_04]: is that these patients run up 70,
80, 90, $150,000 worth of medical bills
[SPEAKER_04]: when they could just have stopped smoking.
[SPEAKER_10]: They are getting CT scans.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are getting ultrasound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Alice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a radiologist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, like really, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, where I come from in Ireland,
you have to be practically dying to get
[SPEAKER_04]: medical imaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this country, I've got abdominal pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I'm through the tube of truth,
the CT scanner.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a problem when a 24-year-old has
now had eight emergency room visits and
[SPEAKER_04]: eight CT scans and then develops lymphoma
20 years later.
[SPEAKER_04]: These tests are not innocuous.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are benign.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would simply say, you know,
if you smoke cannabis or use cannabis in
[SPEAKER_04]: any capacity, cannabinoids, be honest with
your physician.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't be honest with your
physician, find a new one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I may add, if a patient asks for
cannabis after having such side effects
[SPEAKER_08]: and insists on having cannabis,
then I believe that that is some kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: addiction and they must be treated.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in other direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I've spent 40-plus years as an
emergency physician.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Alice, I have to apologize for not
knowing anything about cannabis for 35 of
[SPEAKER_03]: those years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen an evolution, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like if you come in with nausea
and vomiting and you have so much smell of
[SPEAKER_03]: the flower, there's now cannabis
hyperemesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I thought I had a handle on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time I've heard that you
actually have had recurrent symptoms with
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD, which I'm surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: I presume that, you know, the association
with the high-frequent use was because we
[SPEAKER_03]: down-regulate our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: We basically get a dysfunction,
acquired dysfunction, and so we develop
[SPEAKER_03]: these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's also why things like the
capsaicin, you know, working on other
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors, which, again, CBD works on the
TRIP receptors, why did it cause those
[SPEAKER_03]: recurrent symptoms?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to have you have a little
more theory about, you know, what is that
[SPEAKER_03]: dysregulation in the endocannabinoid
system that might be an underlying cause
[SPEAKER_03]: of this whole syndrome?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so first off, thank you for your
long-time service in emergency medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's better to come to
cannabis late in life than to never come
[SPEAKER_04]: to cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I would say there is why the
focus is that what they think is going on
[SPEAKER_04]: at the TRPV receptor is they think it's
been desensitized, where we know that it
[SPEAKER_04]: responds to acids with a pH of less than
six cannabinoids, nociceptive heat at 41
[SPEAKER_04]: to 43 degrees, and capsaicin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea is that when the cannabinoids
can no longer tickle that receptor or get
[SPEAKER_04]: it to provide a certain tone of
anti-emesis, that the patients have
[SPEAKER_04]: figured out how to self-medicate or how to
self-treat to achieve this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even in the case Alice was describing,
where the gentleman developed
[SPEAKER_04]: rhabdomyolysis from running for 10 or 15
hours, in the hospital they had to ask
[SPEAKER_04]: him, you know, to stop running in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was another case where a patient
in the hospital, the nurses would ask him
[SPEAKER_04]: to come out of the shower so they could
evaluate him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this will just tell you that when the
dysregulation goes awry at this receptor,
[SPEAKER_04]: these patients will do anything to the
point where they're coming in with third
[SPEAKER_04]: degree burns, self-induced from staying in
the shower or bath for protracted periods.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe we have time for one more
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm not sure if I really have a
question or not, but it may come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like 10 minutes before the panel started,
I introduced myself to Alice and said hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a mutual friend by the name of
Kristen Yoder, who is on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kristen Yoder was someone who actually
brought this particular topic to the
[SPEAKER_05]: forefront of the cannabis community a few
months ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And boy, the backlash of people in the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of coming together and being
loving, there was all this, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it in her head?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure it was this, that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Poisoning, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people were really not very
supportive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm here to support you, Alice,
on your journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it has not been easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really appreciate from the bottom of
my heart how grateful I am that you are so
[SPEAKER_05]: vulnerable and willing to be so courageous
to the group here today, no matter what
[SPEAKER_05]: the size is.
[SPEAKER_05]: What matters is moving forward and getting
this out to the people because there are
[SPEAKER_05]: other people who are suffering.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sadly, God forbid, if you have this
syndrome, it doesn't sound like it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful thing, but it sounds like there
are options and alternatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanted to also say that I had
my gallbladder taken out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I saw that, I'm like,
oh my gosh, I really wonder.
[SPEAKER_05]: But nevertheless, like I said,
I really don't have a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here to support you, and thanks for
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to just give a few final
statements.
[SPEAKER_02]: The person she mentioned is one of my best
friends who has my back on the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do get a lot of hate for talking about
this syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have accused me of working for the
feds.
[SPEAKER_02]: People say that I'm trying to make
cannabis illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to remind everyone that
alcohol is still legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this isn't a movement towards getting
cannabis out of the hands of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am 100% pro-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fully believe in the power of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps so many people every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just an unfortunate side effect
that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have too much water, and you can
have too much cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just want to get to the bottom of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, you guys can help me do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say thank you again to our
panelists.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you all for attending Cannabid
2019.
[SPEAKER_06]: And enjoy the rest of your evening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
