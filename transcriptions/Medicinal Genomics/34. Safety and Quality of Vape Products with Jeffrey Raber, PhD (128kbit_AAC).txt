[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head over to canmedevents.com now to learn
all about our CanMed 2021 event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which will take place September 29th
through October 1st at the Pasadena
[SPEAKER_00]: Convention Center in Pasadena,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just last week, we added new presenters
and panels to our schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also rearranged the order of some of
our presentations and panels so that each
[SPEAKER_00]: of our focus areas gets a dedicated time
to shine on our main stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're at canmedevents.com,
don't forget to purchase your CanMed 2021
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the early bird deadline has come
and gone, you can still save by purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: your tickets in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, you can check something off your
to-do list and that's always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if September can't come soon enough
for you, we do have a few things that can
[SPEAKER_00]: hold you over in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_00]: First is our CanMed archive, which is a
searchable video library of all the past
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed presentations and panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find the CanMed archive on
canmedevents.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click the banner on our homepage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the CanMed Community Facebook
group where you can interact with other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science enthusiasts who share
relevant articles, papers, videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: photos, memes, podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know all the stuff you love about
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Facebook and search CanMed Community
to join the group or use the link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to remind everyone that the
healthcare provider study we are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Cannabis Center of Excellence is
still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a healthcare provider,
please take a few minutes to complete the
[SPEAKER_00]: survey to help us better understand
medical cannabis knowledge, attitudes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and practices among healthcare providers
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an added incentive, one lucky
participant will win a CanMed 2021
[SPEAKER_00]: practicum and full conference ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: The link to access that survey is in the
show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this episode is Dr. Jeffrey
Raber, CEO of The Workshop, an independent
[SPEAKER_00]: testing lab established in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Raber is trained as an organic
chemistry scientist, but he is also a
[SPEAKER_00]: serial entrepreneur, patent inventor,
and executive with over a decade of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in cannabis testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 2018, Dr. Raber presented
cannabis compositions viewed through
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular glasses, which you can view on
our CanMed archive page.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 2021, Dr. Raber will present
thermal degradation, a fly, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis vapor ointment, which explores
how the act of heating cannabis oils for
[SPEAKER_00]: vaping can alter certain molecules and how
that information can be applied to testing
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discuss what we have learned from the
2019 vaping crisis and how those lessons
[SPEAKER_00]: are being applied, what additives pose a
threat to vape users, the lasting appeal
[SPEAKER_00]: of vaping products in terms of convenience
and consistency, how inconsistencies in
[SPEAKER_00]: vaping hardware play a role, how cannabis
vape products differ from nicotine
[SPEAKER_00]: products, the challenges and limitations
of testing equipment and methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: and signs consumers can look for when
evaluating the safety and quality of vape
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with Dr.
Raber, I would like to thank this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's sponsor, Agilent Technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manufacture or test cannabis,
you face the challenge of delivering high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality products, increasing sample
volume, and meeting emergent regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agilent offers best in class cannabis and
hemp analysis solutions featuring robust
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments, software, services,
and consumables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their team of experts can develop,
implement, and optimize methods to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: up and running quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more, check out Agilent.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey Raber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we're talking about vaping
cannabis with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be doing a presentation at
CanMed 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Titled, Thermal Degradation, a Fly in the
Cannabis Vapor Ointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, can you give us a little bit of
a... For those of us who aren't chemists
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room here or listening on the
podcast here, what do we mean by thermal
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation and how does that apply to
vaping cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do the molecules change upon heating?
[SPEAKER_01]: And degradation usually means breaking
apart or changing or becoming something
[SPEAKER_01]: other than what you started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So degradation, I think, is usually looked
at in a negative context, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: always negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be that it broke down into its
starting components and there really
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't that big a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would I be correct in assuming that a
simple example of this would be THC-A
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down to THC when it's heated or
combusted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The decarboxylation process would
definitely be a thermal change,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You heat it up and you liberate CO2 to
change the acid to the neutral compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a great example of
degradation technically not being maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: deleterious or bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good example for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colette, I'm on the right track.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's step back for a minute here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine the inspiration for doing
the research that you've done into looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at how these compounds break down in
vaping has something to do with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we'll call it, the vape crisis of
2019, where a great number of people were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting sick from contaminated vape
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the cause for that, do we think?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how have vape products kind of changed
since then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right out of the gate,
everyone was questioning what may have
[SPEAKER_01]: been the cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having the benefit of time now,
I think we're all able to look at it in
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty concretely say we believe it was
vitamin E acetate was the culprit in that
[SPEAKER_01]: respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some other conjecture that maybe
there were heavy metals and things of that
[SPEAKER_01]: type that might've caused some of those
cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I heard last week in a vape panel,
someone commented from the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said they were doing some studies and
they've always done trace metal analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they concretely can say that they
don't believe it came from heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, even though we're going to see
Colorado require heavy metal analysis of
[SPEAKER_01]: things coming up next year, like I think
we're seeing the regulators react to this
[SPEAKER_01]: concern and mostly in rightful ways,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no problem studying the metals
thinking like, let's really be aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't encourage it or allow it to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we can all say we've got a
pretty solid handle on it with being
[SPEAKER_01]: vitamin E acetate and that it broke down
upon certain temperatures, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: rather high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's an important point to
be made there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It broke down into a very reactive
molecule called ketene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this molecule then was reacting
rapidly and adversely with the lung
[SPEAKER_01]: lining.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't anything that had been found
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was an additive that was put into
these vape carts predominantly in markets
[SPEAKER_01]: with no testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely the illicit markets,
I think, was the high prevalence of this
[SPEAKER_01]: to give the appearance of a thicker oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you don't have testing to verify
that that thickness wasn't coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, it was a visual representation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they said, like, how fast do I see a
bubble go from one side to the other if I
[SPEAKER_01]: flip the vape cart 180 degrees?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of the visual test on
passing along the supply chain without a
[SPEAKER_01]: tested label.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't see this problem in regulated
markets nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see that because everyone was
pushing the potency numbers higher and
[SPEAKER_01]: required testing to put it on the label
would tell you, hey, this was 40% or 50%
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not 70% or 80% that everyone was
aiming for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That visual trickery was what was being at
play there and was used vitamin E acetate
[SPEAKER_01]: to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the first assumption was
vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone kind of familiar with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vitamin E acetate generally recognized as
safe for cosmetic and topical use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there is a big word of
caution there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's safe for a specific type
of use does not mean it's safe in other
[SPEAKER_01]: types of uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while it's fine to rub it on my skin,
it was not fine to put it inside of a vape
[SPEAKER_01]: device.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll kind of highlight that
temperature piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what temperature does this break down
to form the problematic key team?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rather high temperatures,
like 500 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting that you see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes you think it's not only
chemistry and formulation that's at play,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also the hardware device.
[SPEAKER_01]: How hot does the hardware device get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there localized hotspots across the
heating element?
[SPEAKER_01]: What really do all the molecules feel in
terms of temperature or thermal profile
[SPEAKER_01]: from the devices?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how might we need to regulate both the
hardware componentry and the construction
[SPEAKER_01]: of those and its performance in addition
to which formulations and molecules?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot to unpack there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's all good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to vitamin E acetate,
I think you sort of already answered this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll ask again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was it known that that would be
potentially harmful kind of before this
[SPEAKER_00]: event, if it were in a vape product,
or was this sort of an enlightening event
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of revealed that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was known, and I don't
think it was even suspected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of was alarming and
enlightening in the same regard,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, wow, that can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why did it happen in this case?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there were some others saying,
but wait, we think we've been using
[SPEAKER_01]: vitamin E acetate for a while in this
respects, and we haven't seen the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that then ties to one,
we don't know how prevalent it was being
[SPEAKER_01]: used, but we believe it was rather
prevalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two, did every single user that
was experiencing that have the problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was it related to the hardware that was
actually getting really, really hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a certain hardware and combination
of vitamin E acetate that caused that
[SPEAKER_01]: problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that question still remains,
but I think there's good reason to suspect
[SPEAKER_01]: it was related to specific hardware with
the use of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think others would say they had been
using it and didn't see the problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: or it was unbeknownst to them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was still happening, but it
wasn't reported, it wasn't tracked,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't in the news, and you just never
linked it to that case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's difficult to always know,
like, you know, what was the problematic
[SPEAKER_01]: component there?
[SPEAKER_01]: How might we suspect that this is coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is important that we now know it,
that we apply that to other things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to be sure to try and
highlight the rise of the acetates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So vitamin E acetate is a phenolic
acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other acetates that may be present
might impart flavor and other pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: they're known to have in cannabis,
not every acetate will have this same
[SPEAKER_01]: fate, but the phenolic acetates will be
able to break down at this temperature to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause ketene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the phenol group to kind of
support the chemistry of how that
[SPEAKER_01]: transformation happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC acetate, you know, Delta 9,
Delta 8 THC acetates, those products are
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to, you know, and even CBD
acetate could do the same type of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: because those are phenolic structures in
the core components of the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be acetylated as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might see the same chemistry going
on with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've, I've started to see in the last
few weeks, you know, Delta 9 THC acetate
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really concerned that we might see
a value types of results for the use of
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those products as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in general, we should say,
look, let's err on the side of caution.
[SPEAKER_01]: These THC acetates weren't produced by the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not found in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That probably is a great line of
demarcation to say, let's stay away from
[SPEAKER_01]: those molecules until they're formally
studied and they're really looked at and
[SPEAKER_01]: understood from a toxicology perspective
to say, should we have those in these
[SPEAKER_01]: devices or be able to use it in a DAB or
anything else of that type?
[SPEAKER_01]: That class of compounds, it's,
it's kind of like what we know from
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette world and other worker exposures
of diketones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diacetyl compound is known to impart a
buttery creamy flavor, but it's also known
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide popcorn lung to those that are
overexposed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a very popular flavoring over
half the components in the nicotine space
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2016 had this compound, but it's now
been a banned class of molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, you don't want those things
because they may form this type of
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need to think of phenolic
acetates in the same way, because we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: this with vitamin E acetate, we don't want
Delta 9 or Delta 8 or CBD acetates to be
[SPEAKER_01]: used in inhalation without fuller like
more fully formal studies on them to
[SPEAKER_01]: really be sure how to best use them that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be the benefit of using an
acetate form of the compound rather than a
[SPEAKER_00]: non acetate form?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as a, as a manufacturer or as a
consumer, is there a benefit to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's a significant
benefit in this regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some, sometimes you see these,
they're called pro drugs so that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe their absorptivity is a
little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get more into different places in the
body than you know, maybe able to live
[SPEAKER_01]: them, deliver it orally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas before you weren't having that
actually be absorbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see pro drug formulations and stuff in
the pharmaceutical space all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also opens up patentability.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's another molecule,
so I might have a reason to kind of go
[SPEAKER_01]: down that path.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, I think they're looking at
it more from a regulatory perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Hey, it's a different molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not maybe outlawed or banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not Delta 8, if I made it an
acetate, is that something that the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: language hasn't caught up with?
[SPEAKER_01]: But physiologically speaking, you know,
there's not perhaps a great deal of
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage to using that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's typically meant from formulation and
absorptivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know we get THC in us pretty well,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We, I don't see the advantage there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We formulated it in tons of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't seem to be a big advantage in
that respects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of the manufacturers are
trying to amplify a message saying the
[SPEAKER_01]: physiological effects are bigger and
better, but I'm not hearing anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: substantiating that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if that's more marketing
speak to say, Hey, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, come buy this and try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think we should err on
the side of caution and say, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: someone clinically study that show me
blood data that proves that this would
[SPEAKER_01]: give me those responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe the form that it's best in is an
oral dose form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might be very helpful in that
respects, but it, it doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to be made manufactured cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, going to definitely
not be as cost effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And physiologically I'm, I'm struggling to
find why that would be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned earlier that some of the
regulations are changing around testing
[SPEAKER_00]: vape products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do those stand now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where do you kind of see that they
might be going?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Colorado took a good lead in saying,
let's understand the heavy metals that are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of the device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other, some States require like end
product testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll say, you know, one state would
say, test the oil before you put it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vape device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others will say, Hey, test the oil once
it's been in the vape device and packaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be able to catch a little bit
more of the leaching, but it's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: same as when you're using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see more and more States saying,
let's see what components are going into
[SPEAKER_01]: these inhalable formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not necessarily requiring testing
for that other than test for the presence
[SPEAKER_01]: of vitamin A acetate and assure me there's
none in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some are starting to add like
squalane, squalene, and a few other
[SPEAKER_01]: components to that list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Colorado, again, it said no MCT,
no PEG and PG and no vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some States are saying, you know,
you might have to test to prove that
[SPEAKER_01]: vitamin E acetate is not present.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not seeing a tremendous amount
of, you know, outlawing or requiring a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of testing for different molecules in vape
devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are seeing regulators starting to
say, okay, what are we putting in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Disclose to me your formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Formulation, all the ingredients,
how much of these things you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some States are also saying,
put this list of molecules in the package
[SPEAKER_01]: for the consumers to have access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which I think is, is nice and
interesting, but some of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, big chemistry words,
people are just going to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you know, I think it's kind of
like a package insert on your
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many folks read all of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have trouble sleeping,
it might be good to start reading some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be very technical, very,
you know, it's very informative,
[SPEAKER_01]: but only to someone that may be trained in
a lot of those technical words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if you cherry pick, you know,
like one molecule and say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, I found this one in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just the molecule, but the
concentration and exactly how much would
[SPEAKER_01]: be introduced to the individual,
um, during normal course of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's another interesting
challenge with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have someone that takes one or
two puffs of their vape device a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way to the other extreme where
someone consumed an entire gram,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, the entire cartridge in a
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the exposure limits and use
regimes that we have with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: much like we want to say, we want to put a
ceiling on the temperature so that we know
[SPEAKER_01]: these devices aren't going over the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we guide users to say like,
Hey, we've kind of looked at like normal
[SPEAKER_01]: use would be, you know, this range.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going over that, you might see
other problems we're not aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we then start to track those
types of things too?
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a enormously complex,
um, and multifaceted problem from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hardware to formulation to
toxicology, to what chemistry changes are
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in these types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's going to be a little while
till I think we start to get a better
[SPEAKER_01]: handle on some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was going to ask you about that
specifically the hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have to imagine that the different
heating elements in different ways in
[SPEAKER_00]: different products could, you know,
really be a variable that could be hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: control for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exceptionally so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even some uses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, you know, see the wick that is no
longer really present anymore,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if it wasn't wetted and it was dry,
like that could be all of a sudden getting
[SPEAKER_01]: much hotter before the oil melts onto
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the heating platforms might have
the same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the material of construction of
those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they ceramic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it touching any other metals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what else may be in or not in the
glass, uh, chamber?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it even a glass chamber?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there are a lot of components that are
wedded or in touch with the, the oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: the formulation in a vape device.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes, you know, a lot more
challenging in that respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're not all at the same
temperature, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The outside of the chamber is very
different than what's on the heating
[SPEAKER_01]: element, which is very different than
what's on the very tip that's actually at
[SPEAKER_01]: my mouth and my airway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think trying to get a better
handle on that is, is really a difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge in its own right too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you foresee that there might be some
standards that need to be put in place
[SPEAKER_00]: for, for the hardware so that it is more
consistent?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that might be one of the
things coming down the path.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we're going to learn a little more
about hardware and some of these things
[SPEAKER_01]: from the FDA and the tobacco space,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there all now going about registering
these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'll start to say, okay,
like these types of hardware were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get through the gauntlet and are
acceptable with these formulations and
[SPEAKER_01]: that might cause like a de facto
manufacturing standard because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to want to make much the same
components or same devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you say, look, if these are the ones
getting through, then I'll start applying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, my manufacturing effort
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got economies to scale and now I can
offer it cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there are differences though,
from when you're looking at in the
[SPEAKER_01]: nicotine space versus the cannabinoid
space, you know, cannabis is more oily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has different components in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs different temperatures to
vaporize the mixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll learn some, but not everything,
but there are groups, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like ASTM and some other groups that are
trying to be forward looking and start to
[SPEAKER_01]: establish some standards for formulations
and componentry of the hardware.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it won't be too long until we
get at least a starting point in that
[SPEAKER_01]: respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then hopefully we can have many
labs starting to study those to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, look, here's what we're seeing across
the board on four or five different
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware devices, not just the one that I
picked for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering if you could,
you could talk a bit about the research
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what did those experiments look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was some of the results you found?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started from looking at,
you know, just the terpene formulation and
[SPEAKER_01]: what might be problematic in its analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's really easy to say,
Hey, look, here's this terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's nothing in there that's
not supposed to be, but why is it failing?
[SPEAKER_01]: For a residual solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was much harder to actually go
about trying to understand where that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be forming when it was present to
eliminate all the potential sources of
[SPEAKER_01]: external contamination from the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and to really start to find out that
it is caused by temperature in the
[SPEAKER_01]: presence of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you start to understand,
you know, oxygen is the enemy of
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually the one that catalyzes a
lot of these problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see oxidative degradants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can then form allergens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can form other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I start to form a residual
solvent and I'm failing a residual solvent
[SPEAKER_01]: test, then the products can't go to
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it to a greater extent with
the neat terpene formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can start to understand,
okay, when I have only these ingredients
[SPEAKER_01]: in this mixture and I put it inside the
head space analysis, what am I starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: detect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I detecting more than just these
components that starts to make you think,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, at certain temperatures,
I see this and I can accelerate that if I
[SPEAKER_01]: raise the temperature and what else might
be showing up in that regard is generated
[SPEAKER_01]: predominantly by oxygen in that case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in these studies, you know,
air was the enemy and you probably have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of air in your vape device too,
but we didn't have any external metals or
[SPEAKER_01]: any other like hardware components that
might be present inside of the vape device
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the molecules weren't sitting on,
you know, this wetted surface that was
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting that temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this metal catalyst perhaps and in
the presence of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really was just the molecules
themselves in air in a glass vial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could still see some breakdown
into a couple of the residual solvent
[SPEAKER_01]: components that might like make you wonder
why they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not at alarming levels and this is
a neat formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these things are always used in 10% or
less in the vape devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not even sure if you'll see them
outside of the vape device.
[SPEAKER_01]: While they may be there, they may not be
detectable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending upon the actual limits that are
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it raised the concern of like what
temperatures under what conditions do you
[SPEAKER_01]: start to see these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I think you start to see them
as you raise the temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely in the presence of oxygen,
then it raises the question of,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, what else might accelerate those
types of those degradation pathways?
[SPEAKER_01]: So would the hardware component do it or
do I see something otherwise because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the hardware component tree as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: So am I understanding this correctly that
the actual terpenes or cannabinoids in the
[SPEAKER_00]: oil are breaking down to resemble residual
solvents or are the residual solvents
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like they're definitely solvent free
when you get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you test them the right way,
you can say like, I'm seeing none of
[SPEAKER_01]: these.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you, you know, put it in the
presence of oxygen and heat it up too
[SPEAKER_01]: much, you can start to see one of the
residual solvents, predominantly acetone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a significant concern and
certainly at super low levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a toxicology perspective,
it's not alarming, but from a perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory perspective of like,
oh, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people going to fail their regulatory
checks once it's in the final packaging?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then why would they fail it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would they be blaming?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who's responsible for those
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the limits for the regulatory line set
at an appropriate level?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, or does this just need to kind of
help educate labs into setting them up in
[SPEAKER_01]: different fashions so that they run the
test without generating that problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was as much an analytical problem,
probably more so of that, that what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of worked through than it was
worrying about a toxicology problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does start to make you think about
these degradation pathways and what else
[SPEAKER_01]: might you start to see, especially when
you couple it with vitamin E acetate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you start to know that there are,
you know, deleterious degradation of some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just like, like maybe I'll throw
it out there to everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you combust cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know how much THC you have on the
flower material, but our study that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: done, I think it was 2015, like we could
only find 40 plus percent of the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: THC molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking everywhere at the smoke stream,
the side streams, inside the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: combusted plant material that was there,
like capture everything possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where the rest of it went,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't all become CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: It breaks down into many different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at combustion analysis of
plant material, you see some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: same, you know, residual solvent pieces
like acetone, that's known to form just
[SPEAKER_01]: from the plant materials, because these
components will break down like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at a combustion
analysis, you see many, many, many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many more molecules that actually form.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, what's their
concentration?
[SPEAKER_01]: And with cannabis or the good molecules,
greatly overwhelming any potential
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've known people to be
combustive in cannabis for long periods of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, and we don't see deleterious
toxicological outcomes from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the molecules present in cannabis are
not nearly as much of a concern,
[SPEAKER_01]: even at combustion temperatures,
as something that's a brand new additive
[SPEAKER_01]: like vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, that's where you got
to start to say, like, we're never going
[SPEAKER_01]: to know this problem tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're not going to have all the
answers tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so big and complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we step safely today with some sort
of sense of comfort, especially if I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: regulator that's tasked with protecting
public health and safety, and even a
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible provider of brands?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that it's best if you stick to
what we know in the plant already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if those things are modeled after the
plant, that they are closest to those
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations, they're in similar
concentrations and ratios, then you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more comfort level from a
toxicological perspective to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, people have been combusting these
molecules for a long time, and we haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: seen them really with like alarming
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless there's something uniquely being
catalyzed or the temperature is way higher
[SPEAKER_01]: than we think in some of these vape
devices, we're probably going to be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: decent realm, at least one that we can be
comfortable enough with today while we
[SPEAKER_01]: embark on the further study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how long have people been using
cannabis vape devices is another key thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to think of, like 2013, 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not like they just showed up
last week and we're really having these
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's been a lot of use so far that
we haven't seen a valley in every single
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does inform us that, hey,
we're probably in a pretty comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably okay when we stick to the
molecules that are in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we should be very careful if we choose
to step outside of what's there because we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have a body of knowledge with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we might see the unexpected and that
can be catastrophic like we learned in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that these products have been
around for a number of years and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't seem like they're going to go
anywhere either because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages to their appeal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of convenience of being discreet
and just being something that people can
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even consistency and standardization,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can make that formulation
consistent, if I can have a solid hardware
[SPEAKER_01]: component tree that's made the same every
time, then I can give a patient something
[SPEAKER_01]: that they know they can... I get my
response that's required off two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: puffs, depending on the day and what else
might be going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's not every single one,
but I get a rapid response.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can really use that to titrate myself
and I can look at it more like a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery platform than highly variable
plants or something that somebody keeps
[SPEAKER_01]: calling the same name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I get a different blue
dream experience, would somebody please
[SPEAKER_01]: stop doing that to me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a cannabis patient really
struggled to find something that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can make it consistently and
then they find that it works for them,
[SPEAKER_01]: then that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing more cruel to me of
saying, here, this worked once,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm never going to give it to you
again, even though I'll label it the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think they shouldn't go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They represent a really strong position
for standardization and for all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial uses that you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in addition, patients can greatly
benefit from the use of these devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: When made well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what we really need to
strive for and set those standards
[SPEAKER_01]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that your call to stick to the
components of the plant and not be adding
[SPEAKER_00]: additives to it and introducing these
different variables makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about adding in additional
terpenes to create a different profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: a different flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there concerns with doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there certain limits that should be
placed on the concentrations of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpene is a huge word to a chemist like
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like tens of thousands of those
known on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know maybe 150 of them inside of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if they're found in cannabis,
we've seen some of their uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand what their concentrations
are in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we stick within that relative
ballpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel pretty good about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But taxol is a terpene, and that's
cytotoxic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great anti-cancer agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't want anyone trying to put
that in a vape device because they thought
[SPEAKER_01]: it was another terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that word is very broad to chemists and
maybe to others that are looking there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I'm playing with botanical
terpenes or sourced differently,
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule is a molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as that is that molecule,
it's the right one at the right periodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I have no concerns with that as long
as, again, it's at the right
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So too much, like high terpene extracts,
may even be kind of problematic because
[SPEAKER_01]: too much of those things, the plant makes
them the kind of keep things away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it might become an irritant to some
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could irritate the airways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, oxidative pathways for degradation
of those might cause some of them to be
[SPEAKER_01]: allergens or really irritating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a fine balance in a realm there
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might find that there's some that we
want to remove as opposed to putting in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having the ability to tailor which ones
you use might be very, very advantageous,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially to certain populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But terpenes from cannabis or found in
cannabis from other sources even,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel pretty comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you start to grab some unbeknownst
terpene from somewhere else because you
[SPEAKER_01]: think it drives a unique effect,
well, then we might have other problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if it was something that was
never heated and inhaled before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winding down here, I was wondering,
is there anything consumers can look for
[SPEAKER_00]: in products that can kind of help them
determine safety, quality or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that so they can maybe kind of avoid some
of these pitfalls until we kind of really
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what the regulations or what
the standards should be?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to be different in
different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some states will already have been putting
rules in place, but I think we'll see more
[SPEAKER_01]: of them catch up and evolve their rules to
do so too, like say what's in the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are these components found in
cannabis or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: What might their concentrations be,
which I can infer from the THC
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration or the CBD concentration of
the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does my brand or producer tell me
about their quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: How transparent are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they trying to demonstrate to me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do I see on the label of
the packaging?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those types of things, you kind of
got to look at it holistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like each part of it is going to be a
little bit of a clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that along with standardized
or consistent products being generated,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I can consistently output the same
thing, I'm probably watching my quality
[SPEAKER_01]: very consistently to make sure I'm doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm probably more minded towards being
careful of what I'm putting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, ask the brands,
ask the producers, ask those that are
[SPEAKER_01]: providing the products and see what kind
of answers you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it might not always be on the
label or in the package, but most of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are pretty engaged with consumers,
especially via social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can kind of see, hey, they're
trying to tell me the right things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do I really know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I'm going to use this product for
the next five years, maybe it's worth me
[SPEAKER_01]: sending one to the lab and paying a couple
hundred bucks to go find out myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every lab that I know of will be happy to
work with an individual at pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonable prices to say, like,
yeah, if you want to check your
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency or you want to know that this
one's fine, most all of them will do that
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit more extreme and a
little more costly because I know even the
[SPEAKER_01]: products can be expensive for patients,
but you could go to that extreme if you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I let you go, I wanted to give you
a chance to plug any social media
[SPEAKER_00]: websites, any and everything you'd like to
share with the audience so they can get in
