[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, we talk with Dr. Punya
Nachapa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Punya runs a research program at Colorado
State University that is focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding the interactions between
plants, pathogens, and insect vectors in
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, including hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her team recently published a paper that
identified several different viruses in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado hemp samples, most notably beet
curly top virus, which is a pathogen known
[SPEAKER_01]: to infect several different plant species.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our conversation, we discuss the
prevalence of beet curly top virus in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado hemp, how BCTV compares to
hoplatinviroid, the BCTV disease
[SPEAKER_01]: progression in hemp and cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also talk at length about the only
known mode of transmission for BCTV,
[SPEAKER_01]: the beet leafhopper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also get into strategies for preventing
BCTV and keeping leafhoppers away,
[SPEAKER_01]: and finally, we discuss other viruses and
viroids cannabis and hemp growers should
[SPEAKER_01]: be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Punya, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Eugentech.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Punya Nechapa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Punya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great to be with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're happy to have you here to talk
about a topic that's becoming more top of
[SPEAKER_01]: mind for cannabis and hemp growers,
and that's viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, plants can get viruses too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and your team have published a paper
in December that examined symptomatic hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf samples from Colorado for beet curly
top virus, which might be a virus that
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners might not be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get into that, tell us a bit
about what you found and what you
[SPEAKER_01]: published in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved to Colorado State University in
2018, and Dr. Whitney Cranshaw,
[SPEAKER_00]: who had done most of the work on
characterizing pest complex, insect pests
[SPEAKER_00]: on hemp, had alerted me to these
virus-looking hemp plants in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we didn't know anything at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like very typical yellowing and
stunting symptoms, and I was planning to
[SPEAKER_00]: go take a look at it in the 2019 field
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I could do it myself,
we had growers reaching out to my lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant diagnostic clinic here at CSU.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just an outbreak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, we went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Whitney Cranshaw came out with us,
and it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The range of symptoms, which I published
some of it in a short review in Outlooks
[SPEAKER_00]: in Pest Management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the high level of incidence,
like you mentioned, 81% incidence is just
[SPEAKER_00]: staggering in this new crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty spectacular and spread
across the western slope, where we grow
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the hemp here in Colorado and the
northeastern area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my student who led that work,
Judith Chiginski, we continued to survey
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2020 because the initial survey was in
2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2020, it was limited because we had
another virus disrupting our lives,
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, we found in the limited survey,
we found close to 100% BCTV in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last year, I have some good news for
my growers, only around 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it was very dry, and there was
hardly anything green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many hemp growers didn't even grow much
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lack of green vegetation may have
been one reason for lower incidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this disease, this virus has been
around for over hundreds of years in other
[SPEAKER_00]: crop species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely to show up in hemp
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that percentage of prevalence that
you're finding with B.
[SPEAKER_01]: curly top virus, now is that in
symptomatic leaves only, or is that in
[SPEAKER_01]: asymptomatic plants as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2019, the work we published in the
paper was very targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just the symptomatic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, even that was
questionable, because we'd seen such a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of symptoms from curling to
something that we fondly call taco leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf had completely curled up like a
taco would.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them tested positive for BCTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only in symptomatic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But currently, we are having an experiment
in our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with this hemp genetics
developing company here in Port Collins,
[SPEAKER_00]: New West Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're screening some of their lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are asymptomatic,
but test positive for BCTV using PCR.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, and then you've seen
our paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had so many different viruses in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them were healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the sample from Larimer County
that had cannabis cryptic virus was
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy and beautiful as ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really don't know the impact of
these viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one viroid, which is also pretty
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know that cannabis cryptic virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no wonder why they call it cannabis
cryptic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of a mystery.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to ask you about other
viruses too, because I had mentioned that
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses are becoming more top of mind for
hemp and cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one that gets all the publicity or
gets all the notoriety is actually the
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid, hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder, how does beet curly top virus
differ from hoplite and viroid?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could there be some sort of a case of
misidentification?
[SPEAKER_01]: People thinking they have hoplite and
viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually have beet curly top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to initiate a hoplite
and viroid project to do, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: a better characterization of it to help
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the name suggests, it's latent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's dormant in the plant and can go
asymptomatic for weeks to months is my
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it causes the so-called dudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what the growers call it,
where the flowers just don't flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: are completely destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we detected hoplite and viroid in our
samples from two counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those samples predominantly had BCTD
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coincidentally, they were infected
with hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that the samples came from a
different plant, because we had pooled
[SPEAKER_00]: samples from different plants in our
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't firsthand seen it,
but in talking with a colleague in Simon,
[SPEAKER_00]: Fraser University in Canada, Dr. Zamir
Punja, who is a very well-known hemp plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathologist, he was telling us how
predominant and prevalent it is in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he mentioned something like 70% or
80% of the cannabis being infected with
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid in a study that he had
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty staggering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the big difference between BCTD
and hoplite and viroid to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hoplite and viroid unlike BCTD can be
transmitted mechanically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you touch an infected plant and you
have no idea that it's infected because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's presumably asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you handle a healthy plant and it gets
transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with BCTD, fortunately, there's only
one mode of transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beet leaf hopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other species of leaf hopper can even
transmit it to our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's just such a tight
evolutionary relationship, just one
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work with aphids that transmit
viruses like this potato virus Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are over 60 species of aphids
that can transmit the virus, but the BCTD,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as we know, it's not seed
transmitted, BCTD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're confirming that in our lab because
some growers have that condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, I think hoplite and viroid,
because of the mechanical transmission is
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading more rampantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we just got a sample from a
colleague in California that outwardly
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like BCTD, but tested positive for
both BCTD and hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this mixed infection and who
knows what kind of synergism or antagonism
[SPEAKER_00]: the multiple infections can have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a great point about hoplite and
viroid and sort of the unique challenges
[SPEAKER_01]: that that raises.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to consider too is just the
clonal propagation of cannabis and hemp as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're taking a cutting from a plant
that you presume is not infected,
[SPEAKER_01]: now you're handing a bomb to your
colleague or your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then who knows the impact on the cross
state or cross country movement and
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing these pathogens, because it's
not very well defined as yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed certification or cuttings.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or certified clones too that are virus
free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we ourselves in medicinal genomics,
we're trying to develop PCR assays to help
[SPEAKER_01]: people screen and do things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe eventually we'll get there,
but yeah, it's still very, very early in
[SPEAKER_01]: that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to come back to the leaf hoppers
because that is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize, I read in the paper that
it was the primary source of infection,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't know that it was the only
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm curious more sort of about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that synergistic relationship
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, you know, the virus and
the vector, the virus is only able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, infect a plant via the beet leaf
hopper, this one vector circulifer
[SPEAKER_00]: tinnitus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and that's my training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an entomologist by training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these fields, in these hemp fields,
like you can see in my background,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we go or we use insect nets to sweep
and there we found around eight to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: different species of leaf hoppers and we
tested each and every one of them and only
[SPEAKER_00]: circulifer tinnitus was positive for this
exact same strain that we were detecting
[SPEAKER_00]: in our hemp sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to date, no one has shown any other
means of transmission of BCTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one study from Iran,
I believe, showing BCTV was seed
[SPEAKER_00]: transmitted in petunia, but not in,
and it was very low transmission rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not in sugar beets or tomatoes,
some of the other major crops that BCTV
[SPEAKER_00]: infects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the insect picks up the virus from an
infected plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a phloem limited virus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only in the phloem tissue of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the insect feeds on in the phloem,
it's a phloem feeding insect, sucks up the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus, the virus enters the insect gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not replicate as far as we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just circulates through the gut of the
insect and then comes and reinfects the
[SPEAKER_00]: salivary glands of the insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the insect feeds on a healthy
plant, usually they salivate and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: when the virus particles of the virions
come out and infect the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's interesting is Judith,
second part of her thesis, my student that
[SPEAKER_00]: led this work, she, we're getting ready to
publish where we're showing that virus
[SPEAKER_00]: infected insects actually have better
reproduction, better life history
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when they get infected,
they do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And able to proliferate more and spread
the virus more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the virus is, you know, manipulating
vector performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been shown for other systems,
but first time for BCTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very intimate relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And am I correct in maybe assuming that
the virus doesn't replicate via mechanical
[SPEAKER_01]: transmission because the virus you know,
is exposed to the elements or whatever on
[SPEAKER_01]: the instruments that you might be using
and it's not able to proliferate,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then if it's within the gut of this
leaf hopper, it's kind of more protected
[SPEAKER_01]: from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that safe to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there are viruses that do proliferate
via mechanical transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the most notorious one is tobacco
mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is, so I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, how that come this
evolutionarily tight relationship has come
[SPEAKER_00]: around with just this one species of
insect vector, but presumably you're
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are, you know, being sort of
protected by the insect vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this insect feeds on over a
hundred different plant species and able
[SPEAKER_00]: to transmit the virus to all of these
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's interesting is we find that
the insect can not reproduce on hemp beet
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf hoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can, and for that matter,
they don't do very well on tomato or
[SPEAKER_00]: pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other major hosts, they can go maybe
one generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the females can produce one set of
upsprings and then they just perish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something, you know,
they're not, they haven't evolved with
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant potentially, but they can,
they'd still do feed on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in, in during that time, it only takes
a couple of hours for them minutes to
[SPEAKER_00]: hours to transmit the virus while they
taste and they say, Oh, I don't like this
[SPEAKER_00]: too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This host too much in the meantime,
they are transmitting the virus.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do the leaf hoppers not particularly
like the taste of, of hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't feed on it as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, more, you know, we, we,
when we go looking for the leaf hoppers in
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, we hardly find a hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in across in the surrounding
fields, we are, you know, in the ditches,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see all these weeds, weed species,
you know, dandelion and kosha and Russian
[SPEAKER_00]: thistle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the leaf hoppers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really thrive on these bouquet of
weed or buffet of weed species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, sugar beets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we maintain them in our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hence the name, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So given the fact that it's just this
particular species of leaf hopper that's
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading, is this sort of a regional
issue and less of an issue with in other
[SPEAKER_01]: areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, leaf hoppers don't even
overwinter in Colorado is what we believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets too cold for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, at least we think are some of our
tracking workers shown them that they they
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming up from New Mexico and Arizona,
the population, they overwinter there in
[SPEAKER_00]: the more on weed species again,
that it's more warmer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Than it is in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once those weeds dry down,
they are moving northward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a huge problem in beet leaf
hoppers and BCTV is a huge problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: peppers in New Mexico, in Arizona as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly, in California,
BCTV and beet leaf hopper is a huge issue
[SPEAKER_00]: on tomatoes and just devastated the tomato
industry, you know, some decades ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have some tools and tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked to some researchers at UC
Davis that have confirmed BCTV and hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just haven't published it as yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will also talk to some collabs,
some colleagues in Oregon State,
[SPEAKER_00]: where again, we have BCTV and beet leaf
hopper and they've confirmed it in hemp as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just haven't published the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's at least, you know, Western United
States, where most of the hemp is grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it less of an issue in indoor
cultivation facilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm trying to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the growers that that is
who is pretty convinced that it's seed
[SPEAKER_00]: transmitted, he thinks that he got it in
seeds, not clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if a leaf hopper came in
and infected the plant or if the BCTV came
[SPEAKER_00]: in via the seeds, you know, it's not 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in our greenhouse, they're not 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, insect proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are pretty they're bigger than
something small like mites or thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely be given that they like
like I mentioned, you know, this buffet of
[SPEAKER_00]: or a variety of plants, they're more
likely to be an outdoor issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned, I think it was when you
were talking about tomatoes, that there
[SPEAKER_01]: are some tools to sort of be limiting the
leaf hoppers from, you know, munching on
[SPEAKER_01]: the crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the options for
preventing the curly top virus or these
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf hoppers from infecting your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad you asked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, given that, like,
given that this virus is only transmitted
[SPEAKER_00]: via the hoppers, it's important for
entomologists and plant pathologists to
[SPEAKER_00]: work together.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and this is what helped the industry,
at least for tomatoes, there are varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: and for sugar beets too, there are
varieties that are resistant to the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say it's between low to moderate
levels of resistance, not extremely high.
[SPEAKER_00]: In tomatoes, they also use insecticidal
sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but none of that is an option
for hemp growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, and that that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, like I said, it only takes a
few minutes to hours to transmit the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So timing is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how are the growers going to
know when the leaf hoppers are coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's worked for the sugar beet
growers, because it's a huge problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar beets, is systemic insecticides that
that's in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually, in fact, here in
Colorado, and our region, sugar beet
[SPEAKER_00]: growers have to buy seeds, sugar beet
seeds that are coated with a with a
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the plant germinates, the
insecticide is in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives them the protection for
around, roughly around 50 to 55 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the first wave of the leaf hoppers
are coming in from the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that protects them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of that is an option for hemp
growers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's where the issue is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my collaborators from California,
the ones that sent us that tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just submitted a proposal, trying to
come up with management tactics for hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if we could talk a bit more
about sort of once the plant is infected,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of what's the timeline in terms of,
you know, how the disease progresses?
[SPEAKER_01]: And does it eventually kill the plant and
just totally wipe it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it more like a hoplite and viroid
situation, where it's just the yield and
[SPEAKER_01]: quality is greatly reduced?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's such a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I mentioned, our whole culture,
we've got cultures of beet leaf hoppers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab, and we maintain them on sugar
beets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sugar beets just die in a matter of a
week to 10 days, because the preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: host, they just go, you know, I wish you
could come see our colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot keep up with the pressure and
how fast because of course they're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible line of sugar beets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with hemp, it's not that drastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gone to visit fields over weeks
and you can see the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still looks pretty bad, but not dead
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing I tell my growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see an infected plant or you suspect
one that's looking infected, get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't serve as a source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp lasts longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you know, we're doing this
screening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several weeks, months, and the plants
look disease, but not dead yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I am sure they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to figure out in hemp and
it's top priority for my lab is to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: the virus affects cannabinoids and the
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, but in particular, that needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers tell me that the yield is reduced
and the flower quality is poor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we haven't had any actual evidence of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I heard you say there, so is the
recommendation too, if you identify an
[SPEAKER_01]: infected plant, just pull it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after my students work,
we can tell the growers that two dandelion
[SPEAKER_00]: and Russian thistle are top, you know,
there are some specific weeds that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to, in fact, any weeds, just get a
surrounding hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to just get rid of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask about that because you
mentioned that, you know, the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: hoppers, they don't prefer hemp,
but you know, they'll, they'll take a bite
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're kind of buffing on some other,
some other plants in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I was going to ask if it makes
sense to kind of make sure that there's an
[SPEAKER_01]: air that you clear the area around your
grow to kind of prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a great idea too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing we do, and you can
see in the, in my background, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can see very closely, you know,
growers use mulches, plastic mulches,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For mainly for weed control, but there
aren't some mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research has been done with aphids and
other insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some reflective mulches that,
you know, reflect light off and that
[SPEAKER_00]: prevents the insects from landing on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to test that to see if
maybe growers could just switch or use a
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of mulch that could then,
you know, act as weed control and also
[SPEAKER_00]: confer other benefits like reduce the pest
landing, especially leaf hoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some small, easy things that they can
do to reduce, you know, infection.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I know that there are some
folks who with other viruses are
[SPEAKER_01]: attempting tissue culture as a way to
produce a new virus free variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has that been attempted with anything
that's been infected with the curly top
[SPEAKER_01]: virus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that not an option?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have a tissue culture lab here at
CSU.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying, I've given her,
you know, our primers, some of our leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue and RNA samples to develop some
diagnostic tools so that she can test
[SPEAKER_00]: these tissue cultured plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's very much in,
you know, early stages, not anything ready
[SPEAKER_00]: for commercial, you know, not commercially
available, but pretty much once a month,
[SPEAKER_00]: like just last couple of days ago,
I got an email from a diagnostic company
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting samples from our study to develop
diagnostic tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the issue is not all states are
allowed, you know, can work even on hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: for that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is definitely a challenge that
we need to navigate as we explore these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering, I know that you
identified other viruses and viroids in
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your paper, anything interesting there
that, you know, growers should be aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: her that maybe you and your team are going
to be investigating in the years to come
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my department head, Dr. Amy
Cherkowski told me once, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was telling her about all the
viruses we found, she's like, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: your carrier here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just keep studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, of course, hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a grower bringing me some
samples, some plants infected so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, there's one report of aphid
transmitting hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to look into aphid transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one that I think was
particularly interesting in our virome
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis was tobacco streak virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason it's interesting is because it
has a worldwide distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It infects several species and thrips
transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, any grower doing any kind
of, you know, agriculture is familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips, highly ubiquitous, several species
of thrips transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting is other sequences
indicate that it's a new genotype of virus
[SPEAKER_00]: or a new isolate of this tobacco streak
virus in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so that makes it all the
more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tobacco streak virus goes to peppers
and all these other crops that we grow
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Colorado and definitely in other
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's that's an interesting
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, you think about
cannabis cryptic virus and this cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have a mito virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them, I have no clue what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you surprised?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We touched on it before, but were you
surprised not to find tobacco mosaic
[SPEAKER_01]: virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised not to find, but I believe
again, talking to my colleague in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have found tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the other one I was going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and the other paper that we just
published last week was showing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a newly identified aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's original to Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only discovered it in Colorado in 2015,
a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's one of the most prolific
aphids in this potato growing region here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado and happens to transmit very
efficiently potato virus Y, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: number one virus that affects potato
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but we did not find potato virus Y in
our hemp samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think everything's on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp has just, you know, changed the whole
pack of system.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and I wasn't aware that folks had
identified tobacco mosaic virus in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and or hemp yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we have a lot of customers asking
us about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't been able to find it in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do have some information,
we'd be definitely interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely put you in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure he mentioned this,
but it's not it's not published.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but I could put you in touch with Dr.
Zamiya Poonja.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's super.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't realize it was Dr. Poonja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Dr. Poonja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's he's been a guest on the podcast
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reach out to him unless I'm mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's prolific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that we haven't found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, again, we have a lot of customers
who are interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done I've done some research and,
you know, interesting to find out that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was the first virus ever identified and
that it's you know, it sounds like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very robust and can, you know,
can still be viable long after it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: on other surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So TMV, I've even heard that it can be on
cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had a customer mention that like,
oh, I don't let anyone who smokes go
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere near our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were kind of thinking he was just
paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you read more about it and like,
no, that seems pretty prudent,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So winding down here, again, I think you
mentioned some of the things that your
[SPEAKER_01]: team is working on and things to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will give you an opportunity to share
that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's any website or materials or
social media or anything, people can
[SPEAKER_01]: connect with you and stay up to date with
the with the work that you guys are doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: please plug away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I mentioned, we just published
this paper on cannabis aphid being a
[SPEAKER_00]: vector for PVY.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing now, and this is funded
by USDA, which is so great that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, USDA has removed these
restrictions against the crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows researchers to get funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have good funding for to work on
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big one we're focusing on is hemp
russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's microscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge one that we're focusing
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another USDA grant is looking at a more
systematic survey of the virome across
[SPEAKER_00]: different growth plant phenology or growth
stages, different cultivars to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there is some natural resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one project that we're looking
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just universities in the process of
updating our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're coming up with the hemp disease
website to have, you know, all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: information updated there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, I would love to connect
with people on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just my name, Nachapapunya, I believe,
is the handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, there'll definitely be more
things coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, lastly, I wanted to
talk about sort of the adaptive role of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's the research coming out
about how CBD has in some cases a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: impact, some cases a positive impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking into that on insects with
different mouth parts like an aphid with a
[SPEAKER_00]: piercing mouth part, hemp russet mite that
has more like a little stub and a chewing
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth part like corn earworm or a Eurasian
hemp odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to see how it affects
different insects that feed differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you touched on something we probably
should have talked about it is resistance,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you say that, you know,
pesticides and some of these options
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't available to hemp growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identifying natural resistance and
breeding for that would would definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: be an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers, you know, of course,
we're working with NewVest genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But growers, as you probably know,
they are doing their own little breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and developing their own varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they swear of how one is more
resistant than or tolerant to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is going to be key for
hemp, given how limited the insecticide
[SPEAKER_00]: options are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Hunya, thank you again for for
joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interested in learning more about
your work and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be very important
