[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that you don't want to reveal
too much of your findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to save that for Canved, which I
completely understand and appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you explain how or how and if you
identified some more toxic additives in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these vapes and sort of what are
the implications there for consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: health?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we first analyzed a variety of
different terpene blends that are sold on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Internally, we have a GCMS in-house that
can do terpene analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we first ran all the products in-house
to analyze kind of the total composition
[SPEAKER_01]: of these blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what I did is narrow down our target
list of compounds to a select few that at
[SPEAKER_01]: True Terpenes we choose not to use at all
because I think the safety profile is just
[SPEAKER_01]: not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more hazardous than it's worth using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is kind of the target list that we
started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we sent out a select of these samples
to third-party labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tested them by two third-party labs
to validate and verify the results that we
[SPEAKER_01]: found in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were analyzing products on the
market for sort of a hit list of compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that are sort of known to be risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you mentioned that at True Terpenes
you guys do not use those for obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know you can't really
necessarily say why others do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is it because it's a flavor enhancer
or some other reason for maybe some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these additives?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of these ingredients are really
commonly used in food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a safe history of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are approved by the FDA for you in
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard that a lot, generally
recognized as safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, none of those accounts for
inhaling these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I do the risk assessment,
I go beyond just oral application and I
[SPEAKER_01]: assess what would it do if we inhale these
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we see a higher risk
factor.
