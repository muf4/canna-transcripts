[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, I'm going to use my 15 minutes
wisely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip the CV part,
and I'm going to go straight to the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to present the most recent
research we have done in the lab on the
[SPEAKER_01]: antitumor effects of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have been doing this for 20 years
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty clear to us, not only for
the research that we have done in our lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: but from the research that other groups
all over the world have been doing during
[SPEAKER_01]: this time, that cannabinoids have
antitumor properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can produce these effects by
targeting different stages of the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can kill cancer cells, as it was
mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also block the feeding of the new
tumoral masses, the process that we call
[SPEAKER_01]: angiogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can also block the generation of
metastasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the truth is that the vast majority of
these studies have been conducted with
[SPEAKER_01]: pure cannabinoids, not because we think
this is the best therapeutic approach,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because we wanted to understand what
was going on inside the cancer cells to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how cannabinoids work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is pretty obvious also, and I don't
think I have to give you any extra
[SPEAKER_01]: explanation today, that the cannabis plant
is a very complex and sophisticated
[SPEAKER_01]: factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it produces not only THC and CBD,
but a lot of other cannabinoids and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of other chemical compounds that have a
very interesting therapeutic potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, among the cannabinoids,
there are more than 140 different
[SPEAKER_01]: entities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them have very interesting
potential therapeutic applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some have anti-proliferative actions in
cancer cells grown in cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the key issue here is that most of
them have not been studied yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing happens with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that some of them have interesting
therapeutic applications, and I highly
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend you to read the work that Ethan
Russo has published in this regards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, most of these compounds and we
are talking about more than 100 compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: way more than 100 compounds have not been
studied yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Didi mentioned before, when we talk
about cannabis and about other plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but cannabis in particular, we have to
keep in mind what we call in pharmacology
[SPEAKER_01]: the synergistic effect or what we call in
this auditorium the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means that one plus one is way more
than two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with all these things in mind,
the question we tried to address in this
[SPEAKER_01]: specific project was if it was a better
therapeutic approach to use pure
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, THC, CBD, or whole plant
preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to answer this question, we
established a collaboration with this
[SPEAKER_01]: company here, Celltherapeutics,
based in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we aimed at comparing the antitumor
effect of pure THC provided by THC farm
[SPEAKER_01]: with that of a THC rich extract provided
by Uncelled, a non-profit mutual benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: corporation based in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the analysis of a number of
cannabinoids, not all of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a number of cannabinoids in the
preparation, a number of terpenes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we wanted to be sure that we
were comparing the same amount of THC in
[SPEAKER_01]: here and in here, we did not one lab test
but three in different facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: one in the United States and two in Spain,
to corroborate this information,
[SPEAKER_01]: this data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did these experiments in different
models of breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My group is working on breast cancer now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And regarding this pathology, we used the
same term, breast cancer, to define
[SPEAKER_01]: pathologies that have nothing to do with
one to each other in terms of molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: markers, markers, treatments, prognosis,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when doctors have to choose a specific
treatment for a breast cancer patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: they check for specific markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on these markers,
they subclassify breast cancer in three
[SPEAKER_01]: subtypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is called hormone sensitive
because these cancer cells express
[SPEAKER_01]: estrogen receptors or progesterone
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since the estrogenic signaling is
exacerbated, the aim of these therapies is
[SPEAKER_01]: to shut down this signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can do that by different
approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can remove the endogenous source of
estrogens by removing the ovaries,
[SPEAKER_01]: or we can use drugs to interfere with this
signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them, for example, is,
I'm sure you have heard about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: is tamoxifen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second type of breast tumors is called
HER2 positive because these cancer cells
[SPEAKER_01]: express abnormal normally high levels of
this protein called HER2.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do the doctors recommend to these
patients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, drugs that specifically target this
protein, this HER2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just two summa per two summa.
[SPEAKER_01]: The names are irrelevant at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a third entity, which is
called triple negative, and the name is
[SPEAKER_01]: self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called triple negative because these
cancer cells do not express estrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors or progesterone receptors or
HER2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, this is the most
aggressive phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, since there are no
specific markers, there are no specific
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs that we can use for these patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to receive standard
chemotherapy that you will know that is
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we tried to answer the question I
mentioned before in the different subtypes
[SPEAKER_01]: of breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started with the hormone sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did was to grow these cancer
cells, a cell line that is called T47D in
[SPEAKER_01]: these petri dishes that did this to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we challenged these cells with
increasing concentrations of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC that came either from THC farm,
in other words, pure THC, or from the
[SPEAKER_01]: botanical extract, from the whole plant
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, and here what we
represent is cell viability, is the
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of cells that remain alive in
the cell cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, as we increase THC
concentration, these dots go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, we are killing the cancer
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can also see very easily in
this graph, the pure THC produces this
[SPEAKER_01]: antitumoral action, but the extract is
more potent than the pure cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to see if this was an effect that
was exclusively produced in this cell
[SPEAKER_01]: line, or it was more general of hormone
sensitive breast cancer cells in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: we performed the same experiment in a
second hormone sensitive breast cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: cell line, MCF7.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the effect was exactly the same,
both pure THC and the extract decreased
[SPEAKER_01]: the viability of these cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the extract was more potent
than the pure compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then moved to the second subtype of
breast cancer, HER2 positive, and
[SPEAKER_01]: performed exactly the same experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the response was exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both THC and the extract decreased the
viability of these cancer cells in
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the extract, the purple line,
was more potent in doing that than the
[SPEAKER_01]: pure cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, we did these experiments in
the triple negative breast cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to remind you that this is a
very aggressive subtype of breast cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: with no targeted therapies yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we observed that these cancer cells
are also sensitive to cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the pure compound in green and the
extract in purple decreased the viability
[SPEAKER_01]: of the two cell lines of the subtype that
we studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the botanical drug extract was
more potent than the pure compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from this part, the take home message
is that all breast cancer subtypes are
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive to cannabinoid
anti-proliferative action and that the
[SPEAKER_01]: extract is more potent than the pure
compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we next tried to do something similar
to what Didi is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to combine pure THC with the most
prominent, most abundant terpenes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: extract just to see if we could recreate
the effect of the whole plant extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant preparation by combining THC
with a bunch of other compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did that in the three subtypes of
breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna guide you through the
graphs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We represent here, again, cell viability
in percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the amount of cells that remain
alive, again, in the dishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want these bars to go as down as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the white bars, you have the
control cells, the cells that do not
[SPEAKER_01]: receive any kind of treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this line bar, what you see is the
effect that the terpenes, only the five
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes produce on cell viability,
which is none.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just using the five terpenes, you do not
decrease the viability, you do not kill
[SPEAKER_01]: the cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened if we combine THC with this
terpene cocktail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the effect is this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you compare this bar with this one,
which is the effect that the THC alone
[SPEAKER_01]: produces, it's very easy to see that
combining THC with the terpene cocktail
[SPEAKER_01]: does not increase the anti cancer effect
of a pure compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: We obtain exactly the same effects in the
other two subtypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the effect of the terpenes alone
in these two cell lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the effect of THC in the HER2
positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the effect of the THC in the
triple negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we add the terpenes to the THC,
we cannot improve the anti tumor effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So combination of THC with these five
specific terpenes does not recreate the
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of the potency of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about in vivo effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of things work in vitro,
and we can draw some conclusions from in
[SPEAKER_01]: vitro studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we really want to sell an anti
tumor tool, we have to prove that it works
[SPEAKER_01]: in more physiological settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens if we reproduce these
effects in animal models of cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens if we combine these
cannabinoids with the standard therapies
[SPEAKER_01]: that these patients receive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to answer this question,
we conducted a series of experiments in
[SPEAKER_01]: animal models of the three different
subtypes of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started with the hormone sensitive
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first of all, we started with in vitro
studies to analyze the combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: tamoxifen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the drug we used for these
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we studied what happened when combining
tamoxifen and cannabinoids in vitro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see here, this is the
effect that tamoxifen alone produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the effect that THC alone
produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very low concentration of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we combine THC and tamoxifen,
we see a synergistic response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And exactly the same thing happens when we
use not pure THC, but the botanical drug
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if we move to the in vivo?
[SPEAKER_01]: We will observe the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in this case, what we represent is
tumor volume, the size of the tumors
[SPEAKER_01]: versus time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these white dots represent how these
tumors grow when the animals receive no
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tumor masses grow, grow,
grow with no control.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green line is the effect that THC
alone produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the purple line, again, is the effect
that the botanical drug preparation
[SPEAKER_01]: produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's pretty obvious to see
that it's more potent than the pure
[SPEAKER_01]: compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, but if we compare the
effect of the botanical preparation with
[SPEAKER_01]: that of tamoxifen, which is the current
treatment that patients with this type of
[SPEAKER_01]: tumors receive, you can see that the
potency is exactly the same one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also combined tamoxifen with the
botanical drug preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't see a big increase in the
anti-tumoral process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty obvious that the botanical
drug preparation is more potent than the
pure compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the properties of the
preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We performed similar experiments in HER2
positive models of breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, we selected Lapatinib,
one of the drugs that specifically target
[SPEAKER_01]: this receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we obtained very, very similar
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: In vitro, when combining Lapatinib,
this drug with pure THC, we observed
[SPEAKER_01]: synergistic responses, something very
similar with the botanical drug
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation, and exactly the same as we
observed before in the in vivo setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white line, again, is the control
animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we treat the animals with pure THC,
we get a modest anti-tumoral response.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we use the whole plant preparation,
the anti-tumor effect is much,
[SPEAKER_01]: much higher, much bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we compare the anti-tumoral potency
of the whole plant extract with that of
[SPEAKER_01]: Lapatinib, again, we see that we have a
tool that is as potent as the current
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that these patients receive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what about the triple negative?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remind you, again, the most
aggressive type of breast cancer that a
[SPEAKER_01]: woman can have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we observed exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we combine, in this case,
we used a chemotherapy agent, cisplatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the effect that cisplatin
produce alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the effect that THC produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we move to the in vivo,
again, this is THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the botanical drug preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, it's more potent than
the pure compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip the rest of the lines,
because I don't have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the take-home message from this part
is that the THC-rich extract is more
[SPEAKER_01]: potent than pure THC, both in vitro and in
vivo, that the THC-rich extract is as
[SPEAKER_01]: potent as the standard therapies that we
tested that are the standard treatments
[SPEAKER_01]: that these patients are receiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, the combination of
cannabinoids with the tested anti-cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments didn't improve the potency of
either one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have time to discuss why we think
this is going on, but that's what we
[SPEAKER_01]: observed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a conclusion, we have more than
enough evidence that cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_01]: effective anti-tumor tools in preclinical
models of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All breast cancer subtypes respond to
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole plant preparations are more potent
than pure cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whole plant extracts are as potent as
current therapies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you to go home with a
conclusion that the extract we used in
[SPEAKER_01]: this paper is the extract you have to give
to your patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only point we wanted to make is that
it's better to use whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: preparations than pure compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to finish by thanking the
people that did the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just here presenting it, but these are
the guys that did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here, there is my small team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank, of course,
the team on CELDAS that was absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary for the performance of these
experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have time for one question,
if you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: One minute left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christina, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were small amounts of cannabigerol
and tetrahydrocannabinolic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had the chance to test those to
see if they were the ones that made the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't point it in the slide,
but the extract had a little bit of CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: and a little bit of another cannabinoid,
THC-A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did check if CBG combined with THC
and CBG, we could reproduce the effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we were not able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't done the experiments with
THC-A, but that's something we want to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
