[SPEAKER_00]: Our 14th guest on the CanMed Coffee Talk
podcast is Jordan Zager, co-founder and
[SPEAKER_00]: CEO of Dewey Scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jordan is an expert in cannabis genetics
and natural product biosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: having authored multiple research papers
in the fields of trichome development and
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism, mathematical modeling of
biochemical pathways, and functional
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jordan's CanMed 2021 presentation will
explore the biochemical processes the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant uses to create cannabinoids
and how each cultivar's unique genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topics we hit on the conversation include
the problems cannabis and hemp growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to solve via genetics, how lighting
and temperature influences gene expression
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis plants and the cannabinoids
and turbines they produce, the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for minor cannabinoids to become more
dominant in future cultivars, and just how
[SPEAKER_00]: far behind cannabis genomics research is
when compared to other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to that conversation,
I do want to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Scientist magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Scientist is a seriously refreshing
source of life science research news and a
[SPEAKER_00]: forum for in-depth exploration of issues
important to both scientists and the
[SPEAKER_00]: science curious public.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tell life science stories that
researchers and science enthusiasts want
[SPEAKER_00]: while delivering indispensable information
on discovery, policy, publishing,
[SPEAKER_00]: careers, ethics, and more.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, as promised, here's my conversation
with Jordan Zager of Dewey Scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really excited to have you this
year at CanMed 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is this going to be the first CanMed
that you attended?
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be my first CanMed, that's
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't even heard about it until last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at a conference where Kevin gave a
talk, Kevin McKiernan, your CSO,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was promoting it pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked into it, and yeah, it definitely
looked like a conference that I'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in going to in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do I know?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys asked me to present, so I'm very
pleased to join CanMed this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're excited, especially since your
focus is very similar to ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're very much investigating the
genomics and the genetics of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why I'm really excited to talk to you
is because you're actually applying that
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic information and actually applying
it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, us here at Medicinal Genomics,
we're sequencing the plant, finding all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of interesting markers and
interesting insights into the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't grow here, so we don't really
get to apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always interested to talk to folks
who are actually working with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if you want to give a
little insight into what you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing there at Dewey Scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so at Dewey Scientific, first and
foremost, we are a biotechnology company
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on battering the cannabis
industry, and we're doing that through a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is through our scientific
service offerings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do there is we sort of offer
cultivators or other breeders a science
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look at some of the
bigger companies, they're starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: swallow up scientists, but not every
cannabis company can afford to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sort of offer, you know,
we have a traveling team of scientists
[SPEAKER_01]: that will come to you and collect the data
we need and then do all the data analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: here and sort of make sense of,
you know, the overwhelming amount of data
[SPEAKER_01]: that genomics can provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second aspect of what we're doing
is we have an in-house breeding program
[SPEAKER_01]: with one of our very close partners,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dewey Scientific, we don't grow the
plants ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have very close partners that do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for them, you know, we have a
quantitative geneticist part of our team,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually our co-founder and VP of
research, Paul Mahalov.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's our breeder and he, you know,
can really make sense of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a VCF file, while not everybody really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, the variants that are
present in a genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has a lot of experience with using
that kind of data and applying it to
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding for specific traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a client engages with your team,
what are they really looking to accomplish
[SPEAKER_00]: or do they even know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think for the most part,
they do know what they're looking for to
[SPEAKER_01]: accomplish.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't necessarily know how to
get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, we've worked with some
cultivators in the hemp space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last year we helped them identify when
they should be harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you wait too long,
all of a sudden your compliant crop is no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer compliant and you have to destroy
your summer's worth of labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, unfortunately that was the
reality last year for many growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just knowing the plants are growing at
a better level can really make the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference for farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been helping people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an interesting point you make
because there were tons of articles that
[SPEAKER_00]: came out the end of last year with a lot
of hemp farmers who suddenly discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: that what they were growing wasn't
technically hemp because it was testing
[SPEAKER_00]: hot for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you offer some services to hemp
cultivators who are maybe just starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into this to make sure that what
they're actually planting is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: what they expect it to be at the end?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an area that we're looking to get
in this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with a couple of partners
out in the Yakima Valley area of
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington State, helping them choose the
genetics that they will be growing this
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, more than anything,
it's just sort of doing the legwork and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the background check on where the
seed's coming from or where the clone's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a fly by night clone provider,
like we saw so many last year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do these guys have legitimate COAs
backing up what they're claiming to have
[SPEAKER_01]: being sold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, that seems to be such a
such a trend in the cannabis industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: these fly by nights companies,
not just clone providers or seed
[SPEAKER_00]: providers, but I mean, we see it in our
end too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice to see folks like you out
there kind of helping to weed that out,
[SPEAKER_00]: for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, and I guess a segue to that is,
I mean, there are other companies out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that are sort of offering similar
services to what you guys are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of what sets you apart?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we like to take a slightly
different approach than most folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually take an RNA based approach
towards genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We prefer this approach because you can
answer many questions with a single data
[SPEAKER_01]: set.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because this plant has so many
there's so much genetic diversity in
[SPEAKER_01]: what's out there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relying on a single reference genome can
be a little problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we prefer to take a de novo
transcriptome approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we take that, you know,
we can still get all the necessary
[SPEAKER_01]: structural genomes, genomic structural
information we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can identify snips across the expressed
genome, if you will, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can look at, you know,
we not only gain insight into which genes
[SPEAKER_01]: are present, but we gain insight into how
hard those genes are turned on or turned
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is particularly important when it
comes to cannabinoid or terpenoid
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just gives you a comprehensive view
of what's going on in your growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of brings me to one of the
things I wanted to bring up to you is this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole idea of nature versus nurture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can have all this genetic
potential in a cultivar, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what environment you put it in is going
to, you know, determine what actually gets
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're taking an RNA-based
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sort of help sort of weed that
out as far as what's actually being
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed and what phenotype you're
actually going to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one area of emphasis we're
looking to expand on is how are the
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that you purchased or the
varieties that you bred, how are they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually performing in your grow area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether, you know, you're a hemp farmer on
50 acres or you're a adult use cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: producer in a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can sort of look at the
genetic performance of your variety in
[SPEAKER_01]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now do you have any any sort of data
on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are certain grow mediums or certain light
sources able to express genes more than
[SPEAKER_00]: others?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wouldn't say we've seen much
difference with grow mediums, nor is that
[SPEAKER_01]: really something that we've really
monitored.
[SPEAKER_01]: But lighting has a huge influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature has a huge influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if we're talking about
cannabinoid synthases, it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: important to know the temperature and the
light influence that the plants are
receiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a change in temperature or pH
can change the function of a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to turpenoid synthases,
these are genes that are highly regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: by light, you know, and the type of light
that they get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you could you can have one
variety growing in, say, a grow room all
[SPEAKER_01]: with high pressure sodium bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you move that over to a grow room that
has LEDs while you're changing the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're more likely than not changing
the terpene profile and sort of changing
[SPEAKER_01]: the chemo type of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just can lead to inconsistencies in
what farmers think they're growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: what they think they're going to end up
producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that strain specific?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are certain strains more sensitive to that
than others?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that we've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just terpene expression in all plants is
just very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: To to light, especially the expression of
those genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the preferred light source?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we haven't done quite enough
work yet to determine that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's it's it's more of looking
at the germplasm collection you have and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing how it's performing in your your
grow setup and whether it's a tent or
[SPEAKER_01]: adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and you mentioned earlier that,
you know, cannabis being so genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always wonder, you know,
do we fully understand the full genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like through efforts like yours and
continued breeding, could we end up kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeing cultivars that are radically
different than what's out there now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely think we can see varieties in
cultivars arise that aren't out there
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because the majority of this
crop was was grown in backyards and
[SPEAKER_01]: basements and deep in the woods for so
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're just a ways off compared
to other other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to fully understand the genetic
potential, I think, you know, a concerted
[SPEAKER_01]: effort needs to be made into stabilizing
these genetics, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you are sort of what we did,
not we do it scientific, but we the the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community as a whole was we sort
of drove evolution in certain directions
[SPEAKER_01]: based on what certain people were
selecting for various regions of the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so have you done any research or
analysis into sort of land race type
[SPEAKER_00]: strains to see, you know, without the
breeder's hand, sort of what cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: become?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've sort of we've looked at a couple
of land race varieties, one of which was
[SPEAKER_01]: featured in our our plant physiology
publication last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a variety called Mama Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reportedly, this was a variety came
straight from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was grown in a light deprivation hoop
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the plants in there were about
five feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this this Mama Thai was about eight
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we looked at the chemo print
or the chemo type of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: the metabolic fingerprint, you know,
it did vary quite a bit from the other
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot more heavy on sesquiter
beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the implications are that are I'm not
really sure yet, but it was notably
[SPEAKER_01]: different from the things that had been,
you know, grown or bred for over here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we all I mean, we all know that,
you know, THC and CBD are sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant cannabinoids that we see in the
in the cultivars that are out there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could in that the other cannabinoids are
very much present at small kind of trace
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there an opportunity to kind of
flip that script and kind of see these
[SPEAKER_00]: minor cannabinoids take a bigger
percentage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think one area of interest
right now are the variants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so they just have a different
fatty acid precursor towards cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesis or THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD, you know, I don't think that was
really on anyone's radar in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: much, much past the last five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think as breeders start to go down
that route, I mean, these are these are
[SPEAKER_01]: stemming from, you know, they're not
cannabinoid synthases that are responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: for this difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's upstream in the areas of fatty acid
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's going to be interesting to
see, but I do think, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the more minor cannabinoids are
going to rise in new prevalence in the
[SPEAKER_00]: coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any predictions as far as what's the
what's going to be the new hot
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in terms of new, I think folks
need to be careful with what is being
[SPEAKER_01]: described as new or or where it's found or
if it's even actually produced by the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and not an artifact of sample prep
or just a faulty HPLC run or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make any predictions on
what the markets are going to prefer in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that as we learn more about
the different cannabinoids and maybe start
[SPEAKER_01]: to tie those in with some some clinical
studies about the pharmacokinetics of
[SPEAKER_01]: these cannabinoids, I think that's
ultimately what's going to drive what's
[SPEAKER_01]: hot is what's coming out of the medical
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess to bring that all back to what
we're doing here at CanMed, I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a great reason why folks like yourself and
cultivators and others in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: could really get a lot out of coming to
the conferences that we're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the latest research into applying
cannabinoids for different medical
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is some breaking research on a
new minor cannabinoid, you'll be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: to know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good thing you decided to join
us this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to go back to you said that,
you know, the cannabis plant is so far
[SPEAKER_00]: behind other plants in terms of
understanding the genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you were to make an analogy,
how far behind are we really?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's make a comparison to
American legacy crops like soy or corn or
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they've they've been playing
with, you know, the genomics of these
[SPEAKER_01]: these crops have been known for,
let's say, 30 years prior to when cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: actually started to get some some
molecular type of work done on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the genomes of these plants
obviously haven't weren't sequenced 30
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, but they were sequenced,
you know, closer to 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas the first cannabis variety was
sequenced about nine years ago with a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more coming up in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with all of those crops, they've been
genetically stabilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a farmer goes and buys pounds of
wheat seed while they expect that field to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow uniformly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not going to be differences in
height or, you know, club length within
[SPEAKER_01]: their batch of seeds, whereas,
you know, with cannabis, we just aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: quite there with the genetic
stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just makes it harder to understand
the genomics of cannabis because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity and the lack of stabilization
that's occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is the fact that cannabis is so
diverse just because there hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: such a stabilization effort or is it
something that's that's unique to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's something that's unique
to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that, well, I think one
reason that that stabilization has not
[SPEAKER_01]: really occurred is that the plant suffers
from inbreeding depression, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: very real threat towards, you know,
making a stabilized variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been overcome in the past with
other deployed crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding depression, I'm not familiar
with that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's if you, you know, inbreed within a
family, it's most popularly seen or known.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say it's not really seen anymore
with humans, you know, lineages of royal
[SPEAKER_01]: families from Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is evidence of,
well, cousins remain cousins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uncles were marrying their nieces,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Led to genetic disorders and genetic
effects in their progeny or their
[SPEAKER_01]: children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see the same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a couple of generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, once you're at the point of
four or five generations of inbreeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant starts to display problems in
growth and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to overcome that in cannabis,
I mean, it's really a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every single inbred plant is going to
have these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a matter of doing it enough within
the same family to identify those that are
[SPEAKER_01]: not suffering from inbreeding depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my questions I was going to ask
you is, I guess to start, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of commercial cannabis cultivation
now is done through cloning, clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever expect we'll get to a place
where we could have stable enough seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed propagation would become the
norm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like that would be a challenge with
this inbreeding depression, no?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think we're starting to see it
on the outside of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more producers are going from seed
than from clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I absolutely think we'll get to
a point where commercial cannabis are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're growing from clone,
ultimately it comes down to the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's my point of view that
seed is a much more automatable process
[SPEAKER_01]: than clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are a lot of hurdles that
need to be cleared.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think it's all about
genetic stabilization and ensuring that
[SPEAKER_01]: your crop will grow with uniformity and
you can rely on your expected results of
[SPEAKER_01]: that crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that these plants are going to
grow in uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all going to have very similar
chemo type profiles and that they are all
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have relatively similar yield
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all going to be female for the
most part too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean that was a big topic in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were buying what they thought were
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out they weren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their crops got pollinated and you see a
tenfold reduction in cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think this year those
farmers who learned a lesson last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're absolutely going to look
specifically for feminized seeds from a
[SPEAKER_01]: reputable source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the adult use industry will get
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the fragmentation we've
seen from state to state, clones are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to remain prevalent for the time being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so we talked about what
cannabinoids that breeders and growers
[SPEAKER_00]: might be interested in selecting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are there other genetic markers that
you think could make a huge impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think if we go back to
cannabinoids really quickly, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these cannabinoid synthases are leaky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can better characterize those and
develop markers around those regions of
[SPEAKER_01]: the gene that may lead to a leaky synthase
versus a non-leaky synthase, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: will go a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outside of cannabinoids, I do believe
the metabolic pathways that are
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for other bioactive compounds
that cannabis produces like the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the flavonoids, if we can design
genetic markers based on the production of
[SPEAKER_01]: those compounds, that will ultimately
initially help the medical field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So breeders can produce varieties that are
more predictable in their overall
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotype, not just cannabinoids,
but in these other bioactive compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: that might be playing a role in the
medical properties, medicinal properties
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will probably be a great segue into
the topic that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: presenting on at CanMed, which is gene
networks underlying cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenoid accumulation in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering, can you give us a
little preview of what the folks can
[SPEAKER_00]: expect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my talk is largely based around a paper
that we had published in May of 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the same title as the talk,
but basically it comes down to that
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical profiling is currently employed
and is a fairly powerful tool in
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiating one strain from the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you add genotyping information,
whether that be a static genetic level or
[SPEAKER_01]: at a transcriptome level, it's just going
to increase the resolution of
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiating one strain from the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that ultimately helps with
clinical researchers with their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a certain compound that is leading
to an effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it five compounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it dozens of compounds that are leading
to an effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, with this research,
we took an approach that's been used in a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of crops, including alfalfa,
corn, and wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it just sort of puts
everything into a functional context.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the functions that are active in
the plant as it's growing and ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: before it's harvested?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things you mentioned there
that reminded me was when you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the different combination of
cannabinoids can be used for a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: David Meary, I spoke at last year's
CanMed, and he was talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: research that he's doing in his lab in
Israel, which is just fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were finding that it was a
combination of three cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were using to treat this specific
type of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was when those three were present
that they would see the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took away any one of them,
or I believe, if I remember correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: even added an additional one, it did not
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty fascinating, this whole
idea of the entourage effect, how that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually is being applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think us on the plant side of
things, we just need to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible with what we're putting out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just so users can have a better idea
of what they're consuming and ultimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And beyond that, what researchers are
actually testing for, whether it's cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: or Alzheimer's or epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: These types of clinical trials can only
benefit from a more precise understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: of what that plant is capable of and what
it is actively producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you mentioned that you had
published a paper on that same topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one you're going to be discussing at
CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can folks find that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's available at
plantphysiology.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an open source paper, so you don't
have to worry about a pay-to-read firewall
[SPEAKER_01]: that is common in academic papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's available at
plantphysiology.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you want to tell the folks
where they can find out more about Dewey
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientific and more about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
