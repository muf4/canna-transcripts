[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, and thank you very much for
the opportunity to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jeff Hergenrather.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a physician in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a private practice in California
doing cannabis consulting for the last 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a really enjoyable change
from general practice and from ER medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take this practice very seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of an old-styled physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I request patient records before I see
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually set up an appointment for about
90 minutes for my initial adult
[SPEAKER_00]: consultation, two hours for children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in California, we can see anybody of
any age group with any condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know if it's in the record,
the problem that they're coming to me
[SPEAKER_00]: about, and then basically tailor a
treatment plan to work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am president of the Society of Cannabis
Clinicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a group that started in about
2000, and I'll talk a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: about this as we go along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all choose our evidence as it meets
our needs, and there are ancient sources
[SPEAKER_00]: of information that are very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are burial and tombs that are,
you know, where cannabis has been used in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have evidence from William
O'Shaughnessy back in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: 19th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was spoken of yesterday going from
England to Calcutta back in 1833 and
[SPEAKER_00]: working there for over a decade,
learning about cannabis and writing about
[SPEAKER_00]: it and eventually bringing it back to
England as a medicine in 1844.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cling to the reefer madness level of
information, and, you know, that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: something we have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. McCarey, the founder of the Society of
Cannabis Clinicians, wrote a book that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't published at NIMH.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there as a doctor studying cannabis
in the 1960s and 70s, and when he was
[SPEAKER_00]: asked to go to California and spy on the
college students smoking cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: he realized they really weren't that
interested in the medicinal uses of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his book was about the English
language literature on medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: from 1839 until 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we have the LaGuardia Reports
in 44 and the Schaefer Commission in 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both these documents exonerated cannabis
as being a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically said that cannabis users
are indistinguishable in our society from
[SPEAKER_00]: those that don't use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the IND program that the
government was really forced to get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with because patients who weren't
getting adequate treatment with
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional medicines basically sued the
federal government, and the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government was then forced to allow them
to use cannabis as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they, about a year later,
they forced the government to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: supply them with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are still a half dozen or so
patients using cannabis from the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were at least 19 that were using
cannabis over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then George Bush Sr. came along and in
1992 closed the program saying there was
[SPEAKER_00]: no scientific value to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's interesting to note that the
feds never looked at any of these patients
[SPEAKER_00]: or their experiences or what it was doing
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal agenda was to keep cannabis
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the feds perennially refused to
reschedule cannabis and they continued to
[SPEAKER_00]: put out misinformation to the public and
to the physicians, basically scaring
[SPEAKER_00]: people from the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even as early as just a couple months
ago in January, we had an update from the
[SPEAKER_00]: National Academies of Sciences talking
about need for greater research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is kind of a problem because we
can't get the research that we want,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly not in terms of cannabis as a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get it as cannabis as a drug of
abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those research projects are approved and
done by NIDA, but as far as the medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the physicians doing cannabis work,
we have our clinical evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis, as you probably well know,
is one of the most studied therapeutically
[SPEAKER_00]: active substances in history, far
exceeding almost all pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PubMed literature and the Google
Scholar literature is full of tens of
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of papers on these subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you already know that the
cannabinoid receptors are in the animal
[SPEAKER_00]: kingdom, accepting insects from hydra to
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's there as a modulating system to
keep our bodies in balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen this already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, this is the presence of the CB1
receptors in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the receptors are there, modulating the
way the nervous system works and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: peripheral nerve endings throughout the
body, as well as in the immune system,
[SPEAKER_00]: also modulating the immune system in the
tonsils and the adenoids and the liver and
[SPEAKER_00]: the spleen and the T cells and the B
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that the federal government
doesn't understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modulating endocannabinoid activity may
have therapeutic potential in almost all
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases affecting humans, including this
laundry list of conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came out of NIH four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they're not thinking of
cannabis as the way to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking to protect the interests
of the pharmaceutical industries to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: us new generations of medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an incomplete but longer list
of the pharmacologic effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that we saw in part
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can scan through them to see the
kinds of things that cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: activation is known to do in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do we hear from the government?
[SPEAKER_00]: The health assertions of harm in the
pulmonary tract, possible smoking cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: causing lung cancers, brain injuries,
addiction, psychosis, schizophrenia and
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment, short-term memory loss and
driving, as well as fetal and neonatal
[SPEAKER_00]: harm are all asserted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we continue to get really bathed in
this misinformation that comes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start and pick apart a little bit of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donald Tashkin is Professor Emeritus of
Pulmonary Medicine at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's worked for NIDA for 45 years in
an effort to find harm in smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he does show that smoking cannabis
causes irritation of the airway,
[SPEAKER_00]: some inflammation, some edema and some
increase in mucus production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no evidence of clinically
significant alterations in pulmonary
[SPEAKER_00]: function studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means no COPD, no emphysema,
even in the heavy cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going on to do a large epidemiologic
study, he showed that there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: substantive evidence of any increase in
the incidence of cancers of the lung,
[SPEAKER_00]: trachea, larynx, pharynx or esophagus,
even in the heavy cannabis smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pick at his data a bit,
you'll see that those that are smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and smoking tobacco had a 37%
decrease in the incidence of developing
[SPEAKER_00]: any of these cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about marijuana studies at Kaiser?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stephen Sidney is a doc epidemiologist in
Kaiser's Oakland Division.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at nearly 65,000 patients
and divided them into cohorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: non-smokers, marijuana smokers and tobacco
smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just looking at the cancers of the
lung, the tobacco smokers went on to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop 46 cancers over a short period of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The non-smokers had two lung cancers and
the marijuana smokers none.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting these cannabinoids into the
lungs when we're irritating the lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to actually be responsible for
extinguishing these cells and causing them
[SPEAKER_00]: to not become a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brain injury, we know that short-term
memory impairment has been observed after
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy, chronic recreational cannabis
usage, but it virtually disappears after
[SPEAKER_00]: abstinence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recent studies are similarly
encouraging with regards to reversibility
[SPEAKER_00]: of any cannabis associated cognitive
sequelae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hippocampal volume changes are asserted by
the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most recent studies there show
that there's no significant gray matter
[SPEAKER_00]: changes observed in cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lower grade point averages and IQ
and performance differences are asserted
[SPEAKER_00]: in teens using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these two are insignificant when
controlling for tobacco and alcohol use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NIDA director often quotes a surmised
neurotoxic effect of cannabis on the
[SPEAKER_00]: developing brain that permanently lowers
IQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study was reviewed at the University
of Oxford and finds the conclusions
[SPEAKER_00]: premature in light of likely confounding
from socioeconomic status.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about addiction?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this a bit already and
it's postulated that there's an often
[SPEAKER_00]: quoted incidence of 9% of ever cannabis
users becoming dependent at some point on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have to temper this a bit with
the facts that this is based in part on
[SPEAKER_00]: substance abuse treatment programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as these people come into these
programs, the majority of them don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really have a substance abuse program,
a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there because it's mandated that
they either go to jail or to court or take
[SPEAKER_00]: the substance abuse program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is more or less a laughable
condition for my thousands of patients
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've seen over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have any trouble coming and
going from cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may like cannabis use and you might
say they're habituated to it, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not addicted to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no significant withdrawal and they
can come and go from cannabis use quite
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about psychosis and schizophrenia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is really depending on your
viewpoint, your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a child that's gone on to
develop schizophrenia and he or she may
[SPEAKER_00]: have smoked pot as a teen, you may very
well feel that this has been responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for your teen's change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, causality is unsupported by the
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the Keele University study,
this is the largest study that I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: done, came out of England, studied
cannabis use in the clinic system in the
[SPEAKER_00]: UK for 10 years from 1996 through 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over that period of time, 2.3% of the
English population came through the clinic
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those, during that time, there was an
increase in cannabis use in the general
[SPEAKER_00]: population by four-fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 18 and younger population,
they had an 18-fold increase in the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they looked at the population and the
incidence of psychosis and schizophrenia,
[SPEAKER_00]: they found that the incidence and
prevalence of schizophrenia and psychosis
[SPEAKER_00]: were either stable or declining during
this decade when cannabis use was
[SPEAKER_00]: increased so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fetal and neonatal harm, again,
assertions of harm and doctors are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid of its use in nursing mothers and
in pregnant women, but the evidence isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: there either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maternal marijuana use during pregnancy is
not an independent risk factor for adverse
[SPEAKER_00]: neonatal outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: After adjusting for confounding factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a study a little ways back,
marijuana use was relatively common in
[SPEAKER_00]: pregnant women and was not related to
adverse pregnancy outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the tobacco, and tobacco is still
the most commonly abused drug during
[SPEAKER_00]: pregnancy and responsible for adverse
pregnancy outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the most important study is one
from Melanie Dreher when she went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica and studied pot-smoking pregnant
women.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had 30 women that were heavy
pot-smokers, and she got 30 others that
[SPEAKER_00]: were their group of non-smoking women that
they compared to, and she followed these
[SPEAKER_00]: people through their pregnancy,
their labor delivery, and through the
[SPEAKER_00]: first neonatal month of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without reading the fine print,
basically she said that the kids that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of these pregnancies from pot-smoking
moms were actually doing better at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the first month of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were more alert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't need as much arousing,
and they just seemed to be doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got this paper published in Pediatrics
in 1994, then went back several years
[SPEAKER_00]: later to see how these kids were doing
later on in life, and she found again that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were actually doing better than the
control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: She went back to Pediatrics magazine with
her evidence and asked to publish her
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, no, this is the earth mother
syndrome, they explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that these pot-smoking moms were
better mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is making a difference and is
likely to continue to play a role in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world of mainstream medicine with or
without the federal government's
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that we have to have clean
medicines available, and that to have any
[SPEAKER_00]: product approved is a pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have proof of biochemical
uniformity and stability, along with
[SPEAKER_00]: safety and efficacy, as proven by the
randomized clinical or controlled trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the problem, because the federal
government does not want to see these
[SPEAKER_00]: studies, so they're not done, so we don't
get the evidence that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you have to have approval by
NIDA, DEA, FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe PHS is off the hook now,
Public Health Service, but Health and
[SPEAKER_00]: Human Services all have to approve a study
before it can be done in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: as a randomized controlled study of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the federal bureaucracies
and the influence from the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and what I would call the drug
war industries effectively prohibit
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the public has changed the world here
because word of mouth from person to
[SPEAKER_00]: person now has it to where we have changed
the laws in many, many of our states.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker green states are those where
we've approved adult use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pale green states are the ones where
we have medical marijuana, and not even
[SPEAKER_00]: shown are 17 more states where states have
approved the use of cannabinoids that are
[SPEAKER_00]: not psychotropic, mainly speaking of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about the evidence?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's valid randomized controlled
studies that we basically can't get,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we have our clinical
observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The founder of the SEC, Dr. Todd McCarea,
years ago said, we have a problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: this gold standard study because we can't
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not getting the opportunity to study
cannabis in controlled studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This randomized controlled trials were
ushered into medicine in the 40s,
[SPEAKER_00]: while the time honored clinical
observations have been assigned to
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal and really invalid evidence,
which I would argue with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is valid evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value of the randomized controlled
study depends upon the study design and
[SPEAKER_00]: who's funding the study and what they
intend to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the value of the clinical observation
hinges, too, upon the expertise and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reliability of the observer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have opportunity for
institutional or personal bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had BIOX some years ago,
a great anti-inflammatory drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: it went through RCTs, but 55,000 people
died of cardiac deaths, even though it had
[SPEAKER_00]: gone through the studies of being able to
show that it was supposedly safe and
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it's an RCT doesn't really
show that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the feds continue to refuse medical
cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interesting little bit that has
come out of the American Academy of
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American Academy of Ophthalmology in
1992 basically saying marijuana safety and
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy, or safety hasn't been
demonstrated through the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that it never will get the
federal regulatory process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they had said was that there is no
scientifically verifiable evidence that
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of marijuana is safe and effective
in the treatment of glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had studied it back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does lower intraocular pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they never looked at was the
neuroprotective qualities of cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: are exceptional and for which the
government has patented the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: patented cannabinoids, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 1997, the National Eye
Institute in the NIH concluded that none
[SPEAKER_00]: of the studies demonstrate that marijuana
or any of its components could safely and
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively lower intraocular pressure,
get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any more than a variety of drugs on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't want it to be studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is effective for glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been watching it for years in my
own patients with stability in their
[SPEAKER_00]: glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is problematic when it
comes to research because we really can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the embargo on cannabis clinical
studies, what the Society of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Clinicians did was we formed our own
journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: O'Shaughnessy's was published in 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put out a couple issues a year or an
issue a year since that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gave us an opportunity to publish
our clinical findings without the
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements of the RCT, the IRB,
and the peer review that would be required
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to try to get a controlled study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the journal is called
O'Shaughnessy's, again named for William
[SPEAKER_00]: O'Shaughnessy, the English physician who
went to Calcutta in 1933.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stayed there over a decade observing
and writing about and studying the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was quite influential as he took
this information back to the English in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1844.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in 1843, his article on Indian hep or
gunja and how to prepare it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was preparing cannabis for use as an
anticonvulsant and for other medical uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in O'Shaughnessy's, in our first
issue, we also put up Dr. Micaria's
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as a substitute for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really throughout our journal,
every issue we have our clinical studies
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have our observations that we show
which are very useful for clinicians and
[SPEAKER_00]: for our patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we give it to our patients for
free, we can get it for a very low price.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a case that appears in
O'Shaughnessy's.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a baby that came to me saying,
16 months of age, you'll see a large tumor
[SPEAKER_00]: deep in the brain on the left hand column.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was advised chemotherapy and radiation
therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents said, I'll get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started putting the full extract
cannabis oil on his pacifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see three months later, the column
shows the tumor fading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the middle column, five months
after we started putting the cannabis oil
[SPEAKER_00]: on his pacifier, the tumor had virtually
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kiddo is now in first grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has gone through some IQ testing to
just see how he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He measured at 135.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one's worried about this little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a subject that I'll briefly review
because I really am running out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first publication on our pilot study
was in 2005 on a dozen patients with
[SPEAKER_00]: Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the early docs in the society
reported our benefits with using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went on to study what Izzo put out of
Italy for years, showing all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacologic, physiologic effects of
cannabinoids in the gut on the CB1 and CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got 38 patients with Crohn's
disease to come into the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked them about with and without
cannabis, what's your pain, your appetite,
[SPEAKER_00]: nausea, vomiting, fatigue, stools per day,
depression, activity level, flare-up
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency and severity, and what's their
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these columns here, each pair of
columns represents each patient's
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stools per day were down from 5.3 on a
mean number of stools per day to 3.7 with
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain was markedly down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appetite markedly up-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nausea down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the P values over on the right
side as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vomiting markedly down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fatigue down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depression significantly down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the psychiatrists that I've seen show
this to say this ought to be published
[SPEAKER_00]: independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commonly drugs don't work this well for
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activity level up-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in spite of what you might think about
people smoking pot all day, they get up
[SPEAKER_00]: and go when they're using cannabis for
Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their weights are up about 12%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their flare-up frequency is markedly down
and their flare-up severity similarly is
[SPEAKER_00]: markedly down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, the clinical
observations and findings are valid
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence of the safety and efficacy of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with the industry coming along as it
is, I think it's time to buy our
[SPEAKER_00]: legislators like the prohibitionists have
been doing for so long.
Thank you.
