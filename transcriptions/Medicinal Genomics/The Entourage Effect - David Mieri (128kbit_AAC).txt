[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for everybody that stay and
survive to be here with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, if somebody don't know me,
my name is Dedimeri.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm professor in the Technion,
which is the technology institute of
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel, similar to the MIT, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have just accurate science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few years ago, around three years
ago... So four years ago, I got my own lab
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Technion doing cancer biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my background, I have a master's in
biochemistry, PhD in plant molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, and a postdoc in cancer biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came back to Israel and I got
my own lab to do cancer biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: I look how to bring plant back to my
research because I thought it will give
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage and then I started to do cancer
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from then, my lab spread to do a lot
of cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, from 45 people in my lab,
I think 42 is working on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three is not working in cannabis because
if somebody asking me if I'm doing just
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, I have excuse to say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just talking because it's not
moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want two minutes spare after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not working, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to speak today a little bit
about the entourage effect and what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think that we need all the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people think that one molecule
synthesized can do the same effect and
[SPEAKER_00]: more accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's somewhere in between and
I want to talk about it and to show one
[SPEAKER_00]: example from my lab that fit to my
philosophy that 50% is right and 50% is
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the endocannabinoid system in
our body that cannabis is influenced
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly through that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't talk about it too much because I
guess most of the people know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but our body built from cells and the
biology teacher in a great way,
[SPEAKER_00]: the five show the cells like that,
but usually it's look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cell is the basic unit which call it
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the basic units of all the live
creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though it can be a self and can
be an own entity that alive, so these are
[SPEAKER_00]: cells that crawling on the plate and we
have creatures that are one cell like
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast or bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our body, cells organize in tissues and
they need to communicate very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm moving my hand, the cell from
my brain send signal to cell in my muscles
[SPEAKER_00]: to contract and they must be very
coordinate with other cells in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: have this contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then cells in our body need to
communicate between themselves very
[SPEAKER_00]: tightly and very organized and then doing
it by sending messages to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are two cells that sending
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one cell send message and the other one
need to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way they are doing it,
we have messengers and we have receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: that know how to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the endocannabinoid system,
the messengers are the endocannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids and the receptors are the
receptors on the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the endocannabinoid system usually we
mentioned two receptors, CB1 and CB2 and I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw in the last two days at least five
times this figure and I think except a few
[SPEAKER_00]: times, people didn't mention that there
are many other receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are GPR55, GPR18 and many
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with 32 receptors of the
endocannabinoid system and I'm familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with 30, there is probably 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also about the endocannabinoid,
usually we mentioned anandamide and 2AG
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are more than 100
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab today have the ability to analyze
more than 120 different endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: in the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of messengers and a lot
of way to read them and this create a
[SPEAKER_00]: complicate system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis affect the system through the
cannabinoids that it's creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have in the plant, this unique
plant, the ability to create a structure
[SPEAKER_00]: that is similar to the structure that our
body creating and binding the same
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, in the cannabis we don't have
THC and CBD, we have at least 10 families
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoids and altogether I know
today to analyze from the plant 144
[SPEAKER_00]: different fetocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these fetocannabinoids is actually...
And we also have the tupans, I will skip
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of chamovars.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my lab I have over than 650 different
chamovars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of them will have different
profile of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this cannabinoids is binding this
endocannabinoid system and actually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a bypass instead of getting very accurate
message to our body doing it very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we move near a barbecue and we smell
the barbecue, so small molecule from the
[SPEAKER_00]: barbecue is entering to our nose,
going to our olfactory system that's
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling to the neurons to create a
specific endocannabinoid that will bind
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific receptors that create
appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're smoking cannabis,
we're floating this with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds and binding different receptors
and getting a complicate reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about the entourage
effect, usually at least what I'm hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: from people and if you read the papers,
the first paper that was published by
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Ben Shabbat and Professor Rafi
Meshulam, the idea is that one compound is
[SPEAKER_00]: not enough to give the signal to the
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one compound is not strong enough,
but if they're coming as a group,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can activate the receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the entourage effect,
the pamalya effect, the familia effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually when I'm giving these talks in
Israel, I said, it's like you're going in
[SPEAKER_00]: the beach and some kind of a guy is
starting it coming and pushing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually if he alone can't do anything,
but if he's coming with his familia
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, then you're in a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice story, but it's not working
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually the ligand, the message should fit
to the receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it a lock and a key principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter if you're coming with a
lot of keys, you need one to fit to the
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors in order to open it and to
activate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not fit to the theory that you
need a lot in order to push it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least usually this is not the way it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why we have the entourage effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because we have many receptors and
many signals that coming together,
[SPEAKER_00]: operating many signals in the cells and
we're getting a complicate reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going and prove it, so if you thought
that this is complicate, this is the real
[SPEAKER_00]: picture part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to my lab, when we started
to do cancer research, we took few
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of cannabis and few
different cells, cancer cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we tried to see how it's affect the
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We read the papers by Manuel Guzman and
Christine Sanchez that's sitting here and
[SPEAKER_00]: saw in breast cancer and glioblastoma that
cannabis can create, apoptosis can kill
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say that this clock is killing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a bomb that's going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care about the organizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way that I'm finishing in nine minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on time, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the army, you know, time is time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there isn't penalty not standing in
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're growing the cells in the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are cells, very low
magnification, every dot there is a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are colon cancer cells and we create
an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a plant biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to do ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We create an extract and we put very low
amount on these cells and surprisingly
[SPEAKER_00]: they were all dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put extract number two and they were
all dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put extract number three and it didn't
affect the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw a specificity between the types
of the cannabis and it's affecting this
[SPEAKER_00]: colon cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it in breast cancer and we saw very
similar phenomena, but when we did it in
[SPEAKER_00]: prostate cancer, the extract that killed
the breast cancer and the colon didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: affect the prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing with extract number two,
but extract number three that didn't kill
[SPEAKER_00]: the colon and didn't kill the breast,
killed the prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we use colon cells without cancer
mutation, it didn't affect them as it
[SPEAKER_00]: affect these types of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to take it to the next step,
we said, okay, we don't know what is
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do it in high throughput screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can grow the cells in plate like
that, but we also can grow them in plate
[SPEAKER_00]: that have many holes and we can use
equipment that can read in every hole,
[SPEAKER_00]: can take images from every hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this machine is incubator, the cell can
grow live in it, but also can take a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put markers on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time that the cell look red,
it's dying and every time that it's blue
[SPEAKER_00]: is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that on top there is a
control cell that are dying, cell that are
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to show you here is these
are melanoma cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to what I showed you
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that there are every color,
it's a different chemo, a different strain
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis, and you see that there is a
bunch of cells that... Bunch of extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: that not affecting the cells, bunch of
them that killing 50% and bunch of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we tried to align them according
the THC and the CBD amount, we saw that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no correlation about the amount
of the THC and CBD and the ability to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're doing another trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking these one types of chemo...
[SPEAKER_00]: One types of strain and we're extracting
just the THC and the CBD and we put
[SPEAKER_00]: purified THC and CBD from these strains on
the cells and even if we put 20 times
[SPEAKER_00]: higher, it's not affecting the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I learned from this that it's not
the THC and CBD alone or it's not them at
[SPEAKER_00]: all, but at least it's not the THC and the
CBD alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if to complicate that, even if we take
the same types of cancer, these are colon
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, and you see on the upper type of
the colon cancer, there are few strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that are very effective killing that,
but on the lower one, even I've tried 650
[SPEAKER_00]: different strain, none of them affect
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing with prostate
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is even in the side types of the
cancer, there are differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can you look on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, okay, let's look even more
narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look on cells with one types of
cancer and one type of mutation that cause
[SPEAKER_00]: it to be cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it driving mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't go to the details because I
don't have time, but the idea is blue is
[SPEAKER_00]: without mutation, this become more and
more severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow, it's more severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we starting to check and every bulk
like that, it's a different strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that this strain didn't affect
the cells and these strains kill the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: in correlation to the mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we find something like that,
we go deeper and deeper, and because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any time, I have four minutes,
55 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who counts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will skip and I will say, we're going
and looking deeper and deeper and we prove
[SPEAKER_00]: ourself that what we see is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a rescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring back the protein without the
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We check different strains that look very
similar to the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see just that this strain is very
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going forward and forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to a mice model and we
check in mice model and we see that this
[SPEAKER_00]: strain is also decreased the size of the
tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're doing that, now I'm asking
myself, do I need the whole extract or do
[SPEAKER_00]: I need single compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my lab have the ability to read all the
compounds in the cannabis and it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this strain, there is around 100
different compounds, cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: tympans, flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing, we are running it on
equipment and we are fractionated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, let's put 25 compounds in the
first tube, 25 other compounds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: second tube, we fractionated and we're
going back to the cell or to the mice and
[SPEAKER_00]: we check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see in that case that just one
fraction, every color is a different
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction and the red one is the whole
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw that we have a lucky and just
one fraction is working as the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we eliminate 75% of all the other
compounds and we're going another step
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Said, okay, fraction two was the one that
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I was left with 25 compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fraction them now to five,
five, five and five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going on and on until we find
the minimum compound that doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my slogan to the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it's one, seven,
20 or all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what is the minimum
compound that doing the maximum effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, in that case,
we find out that we need three compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to get the full effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just three compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take one of them out, it's not
working anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have the three of them,
you get a line exactly like the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, this is a proof of concept of
the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not one compound and it's not the
whole extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's few compounds that activating
different pathway that creating this
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these three compounds, it's even
unknown, don't have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it 331B.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my chemist analysis are very
creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of them is even unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost 1% in this extract,
but it's unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody looking on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're taking out, you won't get
this effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm looking on that even deeper,
we saw, we know all the pathway whites,
[SPEAKER_00]: degradate these active proteins,
whites sending it to degradation one,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reason it's because you get
the flux of calcium in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see this is the whole extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could get flux of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we check the receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is seven receptors on these cells
from the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We suspect that one of them, TRPV1,
is responsible to this flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we block the TRPV1 and we block just
half of the flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you look on the cells,
when we're blocking, this is the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: extract, this is blocking TRPV1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We block just killing part of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, this for me, it's like proof
of concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: One compound, and we already know which
one, is binding TRPV1 and starting a flux
[SPEAKER_00]: of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one, binding different
receptors, and all together you get enough
[SPEAKER_00]: power, enough things that happen in the
cells that killing these cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I see it operate, and this is
what my vision to the next year that we
[SPEAKER_00]: define which compound is doing what,
how they're binding, which receptor they
[SPEAKER_00]: are binding, and are we getting this
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just say thank you to... Okay,
this is what I just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minutes, 12, 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just saying thank you to this amazing
group that working with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Shirley Berman that did all the
cannabis analyzing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Liran Baram, Dr. Liran Baram that
did all the cancer research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Dr. Gil Levitos that did the mice
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
