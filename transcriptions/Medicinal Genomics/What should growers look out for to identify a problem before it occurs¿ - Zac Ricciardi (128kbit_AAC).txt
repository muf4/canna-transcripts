[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the signs that growers
should be looking for to in order to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of identify a problem for it, you know,
snowballs out of control?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one thing that I always try to
have growers do is empower their staff
[SPEAKER_01]: because a grower is only one person and
they're in any given facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's thousands of plants, possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have people that are looking at
those plants every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Empower your staff to come to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need to be an expert
necessarily, but they know when
[SPEAKER_01]: something's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that plant looks different than it did
yesterday, have them come tell you and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's one of those things that if
you don't allow your staff, like I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want you to have your staff think that
they're making a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of times people will not go and
tell the head grower that something's
[SPEAKER_01]: amiss because they don't want it to come
back on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, well, then you did this type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Empower your people to say, like,
if there is anything that's off,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if this plant looks different
than it did yesterday, if it's got purple
[SPEAKER_01]: stems, if it's got stippling on the
leaves, if the, you know, tragedy is gone
[SPEAKER_01]: and the leaves are starting to curl down,
if they're starting to curl up,
[SPEAKER_01]: like anything that just looks amiss,
allow your, how do I put it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't necessarily have to have a
team of master growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to have a team of diligent
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as there's one person on staff
that, you know, can say like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like most facilities have one maintenance
guy that fixes ACs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not on everybody to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have one guy that's responsible
for plant health and pathogen mitigation,
[SPEAKER_01]: when somebody finds something,
he can say, hey, I got to go tell Ben what
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, you know, it could be that they
topped it funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be that it's HLV.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be that there's an actual issue
going on beyond that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but having the ability and that
communication between your team is
[SPEAKER_01]: paramount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those are the guys that are in the
trenches, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you got to empower your team
to let you know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, the head growers only in
one spot at one time and having the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to have a team that can relay
real-world information to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, very quickly helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That flag system that I was mentioning a
little bit, that really helps a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: because a head grower can stick his head
in a room and count flags in 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great way to, you know,
also track progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had 10 red flags last week and this
week we're down to five, then what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we need to continue on that
process that we have implemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are at 15 red flags this week and
last week we only had 10, then we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: switch it up because it's getting worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a, you know, communication is
I think the most important part of
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated pest management to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the communication definitely seems
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, it's a culture,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how common is that the culture in
cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like is it becoming more of a thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see more and more operations becoming
more and more regimented in terms of how
[SPEAKER_01]: they do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether it's state regulations that
have kind of facilitated that change or
[SPEAKER_01]: people just realizing that they have to
run leaner because the market isn't what
[SPEAKER_01]: it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the ability to educate staff and,
you know, get them all on the same page
[SPEAKER_01]: and empower people I think is the way that
the successful grows are going.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you punish your employees for trying to
do their best, they're not going to want
[SPEAKER_01]: to work for you.
Okay.
