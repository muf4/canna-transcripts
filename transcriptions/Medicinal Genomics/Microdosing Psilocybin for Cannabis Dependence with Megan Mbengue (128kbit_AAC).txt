[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this episode is Megan Bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Megan is the revolutionary force behind
Trusted Canon Nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recognizing the gap between elderly
patients and cannabis, Megan sought to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide that demographic with an extra
handholding and guidance they need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the best possible experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: With over a decade of nursing experience
in diverse fields, such as oncology,
[SPEAKER_00]: labor and delivery, and hospice care,
she brings a unique perspective to her
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 24, Megan will be participating
in the Cannabis Nursing Panel and
[SPEAKER_00]: presenting a poster titled Microdosing
Psilocybin for Cannabis Dependency,
[SPEAKER_00]: a nurse-led intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss the
important role nurses play in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, how brands can tap into the
expertise cannabis nurses have,
[SPEAKER_00]: how psilocybin can be used to treat
addictive behavior, the results from
[SPEAKER_00]: Trusted Canon Nurse's six-week beta for
using psilocybin to treat cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: dependency, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Megan, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Trusted Canon Nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trusted Canon Nurse was founded by Megan
Bang and Ariane Williams, two nurses who
[SPEAKER_00]: are dedicated to bridging the gap between
traditional medicine and the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They specialize in creating evidence-based
treatment plans for all ages that address
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic illness, treatment-resistant
conditions, mental health, autism,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at TrustedCanonNurse.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Megan
[SPEAKER_00]: Bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Megan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm excited to talk with you today,
and we are excited to have you joining us
[SPEAKER_00]: again for CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you've attended CanMed events
in the past, and we're lucky to have you
[SPEAKER_00]: presenting at the event this year,
both as part of the nursing panel,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is happening on Sunday evening,
which is going to explore the role of
[SPEAKER_00]: nurses in cannabis medicine and how brands
can use their expertise when developing
[SPEAKER_00]: new products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll also be presenting a poster
about a nurse-led intervention that uses
[SPEAKER_00]: microdosing psilocybin for treating
cannabis dependency, which I know we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get into a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I wanted to talk with you about
the role of nurses in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of what does that role look like,
and how has that changed since you first
[SPEAKER_00]: got involved in cannabis medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you for asking that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nurses play a really important and pivotal
role in cannabinoid medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are essentially the bridge between
patients who are interested in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: therapies and the cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are darn physicians who are informed
about it, but it's really the nurses who
[SPEAKER_02]: are at the bedside having the important
conversations with patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can provide the much needed education
and guidance that patients need in
[SPEAKER_02]: navigating cannabis therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do patients typically get
connected with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when patients find me, they're
typically getting connected with me on
[SPEAKER_02]: social media because I put a lot of
educational content and then they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: wait, I want to know more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis can help with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me more.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can it help?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll be like, well, this is how
it works in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what you should look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how you should try dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we're not physicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not giving prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not giving orders.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are educating them on how to
self-medicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that education piece, that guiding
hand is so important, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can speak from experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom is actually having issues with back
pain recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's doing physical therapy and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing really seems to be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, maybe you should give
cannabis a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she's, of course, the question
is, all right, well, what do I try?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, there are a lot of
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not, I mean, I'm probably
more educated than most people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, I'm not a practitioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having someone like a nurse who can
sort of help navigate would be very
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's exactly what we do is
we kind of, we're looking at the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: patient and like their whole
endocannabinoid system or ECS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're looking at how we can optimize
it with cannabis, with CBD and other
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, as well as other
interventions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of what sets us apart from
like blood tenders is who can make the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are also looking at their entire
ECS and their whole system and their
[SPEAKER_02]: medications and how can we help you
optimize all of those things in addition
[SPEAKER_02]: to trying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now are, are more and more nurses sort
of getting interested in learning more
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that nurses are, first of all,
like burnt out from working the bedside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of those nurses that definitely
got burnt out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're seeing that, you know,
interventions at the bedside for chronic
[SPEAKER_02]: illness just aren't just aren't doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patients are just being put on more and
more medications and they're not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: The patients are still suffering.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are things that we can try that
may have better outcomes with fewer side
[SPEAKER_02]: effects?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where plant medicine can play a
really pivotal role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I know just, just this last fall,
the ANA officially recognized cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: nursing as a specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how important was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this is, I don't think we
have yet come to terms with like the
[SPEAKER_02]: gravity of that, because what that means,
this is the first, you know, healthcare
[SPEAKER_02]: organization association that has
recognized, you know, cannabis as the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine that it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that it, that we get to
start treating cannabis as the real
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine that it is, you know,
the medical, the physicians organization,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pharmacist organizations, they haven't
come out and named their own specialties
[SPEAKER_02]: yet in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nursing is the first one to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that we're well on our way
to treating and recognize, recognizing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis as a true therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you're, there has to be a
little bit of pride there that you're that
[SPEAKER_00]: your profession was the first to recognize
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, nursing is going on 20,
I think it's 20 plus years of being the
[SPEAKER_02]: most trusted profession in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fact that nurses are, cannabis
nurses are being officially recognized is
[SPEAKER_02]: really huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that more, that means that
more people who are scared to try cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to find that, that hand to hold
them in a nurse and guide them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause trust really is important with
cannabis medicine because it's a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: journey and there's trial and error and
there's some experimentation that goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that trust is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk a little bit about the panel that
that's going to be happening at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's on it and what can we expect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm really, really excited for this
panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: In past, events that I've gone to at
CanMed, you know, there was always this
[SPEAKER_02]: talk like, how do we get this,
how do we bring this mainstream?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get this information to the
people in a trusted way?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as nurses were sitting in the audience
saying, it's right here, it's your
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis nurses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's when I wanted to like,
let's, let's elevate cannabis nurses and
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about the amazing work that we're
doing in the space, all across the space
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and bring that to the front to see
the important role that we play.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's going to be five of us on the
panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eloise Thiessen, who's, you know,
she's doing the, also the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: practicum.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to be moderating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of spearheading it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are five of us who have offered,
like we play very diverse roles in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be talking about the
different things that, that we have done
[SPEAKER_02]: and the benefit that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're excited about it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shifting gears a little bit here to
talk about the poster that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be presenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about using psilocybin to treat
cannabis dependency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk, talk with me a bit about sort of
the genesis of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you first get interested in
studying this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the poster we're doing is from a
project that we did in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to see if microdosing psilocybin
can help people who struggle with cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: dependency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know people in the industry are like
say that cannabis does not have any
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a hundred percent safe,
but on our side in helping our patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: we come across a lot of people who have an
unhealthy relationship with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started, we started offering
microdosing as part of our business back
[SPEAKER_02]: in May.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in doing that, we had patients report
that they were like inadvertently
[SPEAKER_02]: decreasing their cannabis use alongside
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that oftentimes and that's well
researched too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the decrease in cannabis is not well
researched.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're like, could microdosing help
people improve their relationship with the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and depend on it less the same way
that we see other, you know, other
[SPEAKER_02]: substance addictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of put it out there,
like, let's, let's get a group of eight
[SPEAKER_02]: people and let's try this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found eight people who were willing to
try this group program that we had put
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a six week, six week program
where we use microdosing group support.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took a group tolerance break together
or we provided a ton of education.
[SPEAKER_02]: We even did a mini dose session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where people got to, they could consume up
to two grams of psilocybin during that
[SPEAKER_02]: session.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had a group chat as well
during that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the results were astounding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were already using psilocybin
microdosing to treat different conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and sort of just saw the reduction in
cannabis as a welcome side effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we were seeing,
like being reported.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then alongside of that, we have people
coming to us saying, like, I have,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using all this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I cut down?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just wanted to see if this could be
an effective tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, not, not a cure or anything
like that, but a tool for people to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when you say an unhealthy
relationship with cannabis, what does that
[SPEAKER_00]: look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the people who are in the group,
it looked like they could not get through
[SPEAKER_02]: the day without, you know, without sucking
on their vape pen multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like people could not travel
because they could, they feared that they
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't have access to their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like the slightest inconvenience
would make them turn to their vape pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was people who were just not,
they wanted a different relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't want to have to depend on it
so much to help them feel normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was one person who was
showing early signs of CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: She had like early morning nausea.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, CHS, interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually just spoke with Ethan Russo,
who did a study on CHS all about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that just seems awful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing a lot of that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working with some other professionals
in the space and we're doing our own
[SPEAKER_02]: survey also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what methods of support are available,
were available for cannabis over
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption or cannabis dependency kind of
before you explored this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that differ from or how does
that compare to, you know, alcohol or
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well understood dependencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is there does exist like,
you know, marijuana anonymous groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't like been to those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know a whole lot about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that they follow like the same 12
step program, maybe that Etholix Anonymous
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are there are some Facebook groups,
but a lot of times it's like a silent
[SPEAKER_02]: people suffer in silence a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're afraid to admit that their
cannabis use is problematic because they
[SPEAKER_02]: have all these people saying cannabis is
this amazing, wonderful medicine and a
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like shame on you for having a problem
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not addictive, which is all
completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then they're just kind of like
suffering in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's not a whole lot of support out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's it's an important
point that you can have an unhealthy
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with just about anything,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even things that are good for you,
like exercise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is it about psilocybin that makes
it helpful for addressing issues like
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have found and what the
research supports with psilocybin is that
[SPEAKER_02]: it can one, like quiet, quiet the brain
chatter, you know, the stories that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: telling ourselves, like I can't I can't be
in the room with this person because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just kind of like quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people aren't feeling the need to
escape certain situations because that
[SPEAKER_02]: brain chatter has quieted down and it can
widen the window of tolerance for people
[SPEAKER_02]: and their anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things that used to make them anxious
and turn to their vape pen no longer has
[SPEAKER_02]: that effect or has less of that effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one example could be people who
who have road rage and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the smallest thing on the road could set
them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But microdosing can kind of help like,
oh, this person cut me off, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm just going to continue on my
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps things like roll off people's
shoulders more so they're not turning to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to numb out from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that's an important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like it's more of a
psychological dependency than a physical
[SPEAKER_00]: dependency on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair, but also because, you know,
the ECS and the way that our receptors
[SPEAKER_02]: work, if the receptors are used to getting
all of this THC, then you pull away the
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there are withdrawal symptoms
that come with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lights turned off right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, there are withdrawal symptoms
and then we kind of like help people like
[SPEAKER_02]: manage those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microdosing can be a great tool for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Magnesium glycinate can be a great thing
to help calm the nerves and the
[SPEAKER_02]: irritability that people feel from the
withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is it is both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's highly psychological,
but it is also a little bit physical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is irritability sort of the main side
effect there from withdrawal withdrawals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I just did a recent poll
on on my Instagram to see what withdrawal
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms people are feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was like 80 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just 100 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but 80 of them said that irritability
and anxiety were a major withdrawal
[SPEAKER_02]: symptom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So helping people to manage that in
different ways, teaching them how the ECS
[SPEAKER_02]: works and how maybe like getting out and
doing some exercise or going doing
[SPEAKER_02]: pleasurable activity can help them get
into balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't have to use their vape pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know, Megan, you had shared a
number of slides with different graphs
[SPEAKER_00]: that were kind of showing the results of
this this trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to walk through those and I
can, you know, as as we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I'll kind of use some magic of editing
to superimpose them here so the folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: are watching on YouTube can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if you want to pull it up
and where the best place to start would
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could start with the let's see here,
slide number nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the credit score rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the credit is the cannabis use disorder
identification tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, in the DSM cannabis use
disorder, we have really crappy
[SPEAKER_02]: diagnostics for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people who use more than four
times a week, they have to check the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that not everybody who uses
four times a week or more has cannabis use
[SPEAKER_02]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we wanted a validated study tool to
just measure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're looking at on this graph,
the yellow is like the scores pre the
[SPEAKER_02]: program and then the pink where the scores
post the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the average score went from thirty
point two five down to twenty point eight
[SPEAKER_02]: eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that basically just means that like
their use from the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_02]: program to the end of the program was cut
from that cannabis use disorder tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to start by saying like back
up and say like this is not an IRB
[SPEAKER_02]: approved study or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a program that we did and we
collected data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, am I reading this right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one of them that actually went up
that that one did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that one was an outlier that
like because of the scoring itself that
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe it didn't actually reflect what was
going on with that that group member,
[SPEAKER_02]: because everybody's use went down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way that the scoring is on those
questionnaires doesn't reflect the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like you said, a little problematic
if just four times a week is right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe to step back here a little
bit, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you kind of briefly touched on
it, but so explain a bit what the weekly
[SPEAKER_00]: sessions are like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are these sort of like are people
microdosing and then you're talking them
[SPEAKER_00]: through that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it more that they're they're
microdosing privately and the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting their experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how it worked was, you know,
we held like our group meetings on week
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody met together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of went through like the different
protocols that they can kind of choose
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is very much a choose your own
adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not prescribing or telling them
exactly what to take and how much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but we're saying you may want to start
at a low dose, just like with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then see how you feel with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if you need a little bit larger dose
or smaller dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just kind of go according to how
you feel and how it makes you feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on week two, everybody started
the tolerance break together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody stopped their use Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met all three of those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during the meetings, people were
sharing, you know, how they felt.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sharing their struggles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very much a shared experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a group chat this whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well, that people could share their
experiences, which was a phenomenal
[SPEAKER_02]: support system for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the rest of the weeks we met once
each week and we had a group chat going
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people also like shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: We provided education on like other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people don't know the benefits of
the other cannabinoids that they can use
[SPEAKER_02]: to manage their symptoms that don't
involve THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we provide that education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we met on a weekly basis and
people just basically shared their
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that tolerance break, that week two
tolerance break, that's from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of taking a week long break
from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can imagine for a lot of these
patients, like how long had it been since
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd taken that much time off from using
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them have never taken time off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them have tried in the past
and they couldn't get through it by
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the group support and group
accountability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really played a key role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did it affect their sensitivity
once they kind of returned to it the week
[SPEAKER_00]: after that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can return if they wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people didn't want to return at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just wanted to quit for good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of them that did return were
like, wow, I smoked before I went to the
[SPEAKER_02]: grocery store and I actually felt high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been months or years since I
actually felt high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, that was really pivotal
for them also to be able to feel that
[SPEAKER_02]: because so many people use and they don't
feel high anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and I know that's one thing that Dr.
Sulak talks about a lot with his patients
[SPEAKER_00]: is trying to schedule in regular tolerance
breaks for that reason, that it can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of reset your receptors and kind of
increase your sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially with cannabis prices being
what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to use less to get the desired
effect is always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the THC potency, you know,
our endocannabinoid system, I believe,
[SPEAKER_02]: was not meant to be blasted with 90
percent distillate multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's a somewhat unnatural
way to consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and that's what that's what's making
people sick in the long run a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we look at another graph?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then next up on page 10 here is our
measured general anxiety disorder scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also a validated tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the yellow is each member before the
group and then the pink was at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mean score went from eleven point
nine down to five point nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's anxiety decreased as their
cannabis use decreased.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do see people who consume high
amounts of THC on a regular basis
[SPEAKER_02]: oftentimes have anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like a chicken or the egg thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is sometimes they come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the most important thing,
you know, cannabis use is really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at graph 12 here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis use is hard to quantify because
everybody's use patterns are so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did with graph on page 12 here
was we just we just asked people what
[SPEAKER_02]: their use patterns were before and at the
end of the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is the most important one
because you can really see how people
[SPEAKER_02]: changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they went from four to six
joints a day down to one to two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was like cut by 30 percent,
six to eight dabs plus flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throughout the day to only flour at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three was the one who that one had
early signs of CHS, you know, 50 to 70
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams a day and concentrates edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she was also using Pico or RSO and
then down to just, you know, a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: inhalations a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people were using high doses of
edibles also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they went down to just a couple
of milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is my favorite one because you can
actually see the human element and how
[SPEAKER_02]: each person's use patterns changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, in a lot of
cases, you know, cold turkey is not always
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to go about stopping a bad
habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeing a reduction and then,
you know, continuing that until eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to zero is probably a more
sustainable way to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our goal wasn't to get people to like
quit altogether.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the goal was to help them
reframe their relationship and bring
[SPEAKER_02]: awareness to their use, because a lot of
people just use and don't even think about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know their why.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just bringing awareness that,
OK, you're using this valid medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you using it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it doing for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we use a lower dose or other
cannabinoids to achieve that same effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because we know that cannabis is
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do want them to continue using it
and just make sure that it's in a
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial way.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For whatever that looks like for that
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the micro dosing of psilocybin,
is that something that would be expected
[SPEAKER_00]: to be done sort of in perpetuity or is it
just to kind of get a reset and then can
[SPEAKER_00]: go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the micro dosing was to help people.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I explain this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was used to to help decrease anxiety,
to help bring awareness to people's
[SPEAKER_02]: thought patterns and the reasons why they
were using cannabis in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people, I think, like maybe six
or seven out of eight of them were using
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to manage symptoms of previous
trauma or high stress situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see that in addiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Addiction is not about the substance
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about usually the trauma that people
are running from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was to help bring awareness to
that and help people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Realize that they can actually get through
whatever situation it is without having to
[SPEAKER_02]: turn to THC to help them get through that
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't a situation of just kind of
trading one substance for another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like a tool that people can use to
bring awareness to their thought patterns
[SPEAKER_02]: and their use patterns and maybe shift
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, psilocybin increases
neuroplasticity in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have this this track in your
brain that says, OK, when I go into this
[SPEAKER_02]: staff meeting, it's going to be high
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to use my vape before I go into
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Staff meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But psilocybin can be like, maybe I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it won't be that high stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling calm now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I don't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then they don't use it and go into that
staff meeting and things turn out fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that kind of like solidifies into
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the neuroplasticity helps
solidify that path in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then they don't need it to go into
future meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I mean, it's really something
that's incredible about psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear about these other studies,
too, with, you know, PTSD and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, having one or two of those
guided sessions can sort of really help
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's not something that like,
oh, I need to take this every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of like, you know, you have that
realization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a new pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying you're cured,
but it seems that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't say cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We say it's like an effective tool to
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: More graphs, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have like, you know, this was a paid
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: People paid three hundred ninety nine
bucks to be to be part of this program.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely got more value than just
four hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to say that we sent them,
you know, magnesium glycinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sent them an all natural sleep
supplement and we sent them some of our
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG CBGA formulation because of how CBG
works in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was included in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody says, oh, I don't I don't
want to pay money to help me take a tea
[SPEAKER_02]: break.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is how the program kind of paid
for itself for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at slide number 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how, you know, the amount that
people spent prior to the program and then
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the average monthly spend was three
hundred and twenty one at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end of the program,
it dropped down to one twenty two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people are spending hundreds
of dollars a month on their weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by the end of the program,
you know, they realize that they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: use it that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, they're not going to spend
that much on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes back to the point we said
before, you know, cannabis is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when compared to alcohol and
some of these other substances that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to reduce that helps the
helps the pocketbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that we that we
thought was important to measure in how
[SPEAKER_02]: much people are spending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so where do you go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something a program that you're
hoping to start offering more widely?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where it gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we started the program, we made it
very clear that we're we're not sure if
[SPEAKER_02]: this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to see if this will work.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, we're charging 400 bucks for this this
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for eight people to try and
test this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had we were able to fill it with
eight people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we had a couple extra two that
that we had to turn away because we were
[SPEAKER_02]: full.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the results and then
we're like promoting the results and
[SPEAKER_02]: showing all of the cool things this
program did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had a really hard time filling
the next cohort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not sure if it was a timing
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We originally had it starting in January.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're like, OK, people aren't spending
money on themselves in December.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's push it to February.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we promoted it like as hard and
as best as we could, like showing this
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome data, showing patient
testimonials.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was just not interest in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not sure if it was the cost of
the program or what.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but we know people struggle and we
have this awesome thing available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where that's where it got
interesting that once we were we were sure
[SPEAKER_02]: about the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: People weren't interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is well, that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hopefully we'll put a link in the
show description here, hopefully so that
[SPEAKER_00]: if anyone listening or watching is
interested, they can get in touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now we offer like groups are hard
to fill and hard to manage, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to get all these people on
the same page and in the same meeting,
[SPEAKER_02]: the same time zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could also be a factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do offer one on one support now for
people like we're offering the same
[SPEAKER_02]: program, but in a one on one format.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just that so few people have an
unhealthy relationship with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Megan, winding down here,
hoping that you might be able to share any
[SPEAKER_00]: additional resources that you think would
be good for people who are interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: learning more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can they go to learn more about the
work you're doing or maybe just similar
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that kind of touch on these
topics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our website is TrustedCanonurse.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people are interested in working one on
one with us, then they can reach out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are links on the website or on the
microdosing page to book a discovery call.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and I'll make a plug for CanMed
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be my third year at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the first cannabis conference
that I went to two years ago in Pasadena.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I booked it like the week before
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the last minute thing because
I just live half an hour away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the best decision I made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the amount that I learned and the
connections that I made at that conference
[SPEAKER_02]: and then going to Florida last year was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then because it's a smaller
conference, it's easier and more intimate
[SPEAKER_02]: space to really get to know people and
talk to the Bonnie Goldstein's and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Justin Sulaaks and eat dinner across from
Ethan Russo and have real conversations
[SPEAKER_02]: with these game changers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so glad you said that too,
because that's something that we're even
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do more of this year is kind of
providing more of those opportunities for
[SPEAKER_00]: the attendees to sort of talk outside of
the lecture hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have those conversations and make
those connections because that's where all
[SPEAKER_00]: the real value is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where kind of the lasting effects
really happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to the beach
volleyball myself, the food.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, the people too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there'll be a number of
people there who are excited to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Megan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to seeing you down in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoyed my conversation with
Megan Bang.
