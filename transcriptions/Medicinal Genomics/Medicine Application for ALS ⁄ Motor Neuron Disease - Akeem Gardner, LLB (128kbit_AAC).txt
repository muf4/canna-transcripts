[SPEAKER_00]: My next question is, which one of these
indications is sort of the furthest along
[SPEAKER_00]: or closest to actually doing clinical
trials?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like it's this ALS motor
neuron application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Motor neuron disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last year, we've learned a lot
about ALS motor neuron disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've learned a lot about how the cannabis
plant has helped people suffering from
[SPEAKER_01]: neurological ailments, since the beginning
of time in a variety of different
[SPEAKER_01]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, leaning on the experience of
Dr. Ethan Russo, our senior medical
[SPEAKER_01]: advisor, and what the work that they did
formally at GW Pharma, we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis can help in severe neurological
diseases, neurodegenerative diseases,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ALS motor neuron disease is an area
where these patients, they need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them use cannabis right now to
help manage their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't have something
standardized, and the practitioner doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: always know what the patient is using,
even though they can come into the clinic
[SPEAKER_01]: and say, hey, we're using cannabis,
we feel better, we're eating more,
[SPEAKER_01]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our goal is to be able to leverage all
the work previously done, along with some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the new work that we're doing right
now, to be able to move this forward into
[SPEAKER_01]: the clinic and really help a patient
population that's looking for answers,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's looking for help, that's looking
for a better quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really deserves to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, the therapeutic that you're sort
of evaluating, is that a single molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it sort of a combination of
different compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally speaking, when we evaluate
our assets in any indication, we put a
[SPEAKER_01]: series of different candidates in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will put, like, highly purified
single can-flavin, can-A.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put can-A extract, and then we can
put combination extract in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and see what performs best based on the
mixture, the cocktail mixture,
[SPEAKER_01]: the almost entouraged or synergistic
approach, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, based on the work previously done,
and based on, again, being a student of
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Rizzo, we know that in the clinic,
for humans, it's probably not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a single mixture, a single ingredient that
has the best opportunity to help these
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a cocktail mixture,
a cocktail approach, not dissimilar to how
[SPEAKER_01]: these patients are getting treated right
now, but we can talk about that a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was saying, we put together a series
of different molecules found in the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: at various concentrations, at safe
concentrations, that we believe can be
[SPEAKER_01]: delivered to patients chronically on an
everyday basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can help them manage their symptoms,
that can improve their quality of life,
[SPEAKER_01]: and might also be neuroprotective as well,
and help them with survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think that we have something that
can be disease-modifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we just have to continue to go out and
improve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where are we at now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe let's, how about a little
preview?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to give away too much,
because we want people to come out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: event, but what are you looking to present
at CanMed?
[SPEAKER_01]: So at CanMed, we have a series of,
again, previous literature that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: done, but also some unique experiments
that we've recently done to validate that
[SPEAKER_01]: our combination actually does work how we
think it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited to share some of
this information, share, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: the process that we went through from
looking at all the things previously done
[SPEAKER_01]: to adding our unique twists on it,
and then showing what the result is and
[SPEAKER_01]: how we got it to work in our favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
Thank you.
