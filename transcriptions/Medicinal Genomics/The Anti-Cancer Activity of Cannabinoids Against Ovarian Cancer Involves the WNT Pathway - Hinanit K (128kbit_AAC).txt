[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everybody and good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I would like to thank the
organizers for inviting me to give this
[SPEAKER_00]: talk and to share with you some of the
activity that we do in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this work, we are collaborating with
Michelle and Bruce Kendall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work is the vision and legacy of a
very unique lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: In early 2016, at just the age of 43,
Michelle was diagnosed with advanced stage
[SPEAKER_02]: ovarian cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: She went through conventional treatment
and entered into alternating sequences of
[SPEAKER_02]: remission and recurrence.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2018, she stumbled across the then
emerging literature on cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_02]: potential treatment for cancers and
quickly got to the point of realizing that
[SPEAKER_02]: the responses of cancers to cannabinoids
was specific to every cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she came to the question, what do I
need to take to cure my cancer,
[SPEAKER_02]: ovarian cancer at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of you may remember her from
CanMed 2019 when she was here with this
[SPEAKER_02]: glittery hat with a vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: A videographer in tow handing out bumper
stickers and asking everyone that she
[SPEAKER_02]: could find who's working on ovarian
cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer which she got was nobody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so the film, she did make her film
and it was ready to go on to the film
[SPEAKER_02]: festival circuit in March of 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, that all got canceled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she turned and together we turned
and decided that it was going to be up to
[SPEAKER_02]: us to find the research that might cure
her disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point, she made contact with
Hinnanit and we entered into an agreement
[SPEAKER_02]: where we would fund the research in
Hinnanit's lab to look at the pre-clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: studies of cannabis on ovarian cancer,
both with the hope of helping saving
[SPEAKER_02]: Michelle's life, but also looking for a
cure to this terrible disease which has a
[SPEAKER_02]: very high mortality rate because it's
almost always diagnosed at advanced
[SPEAKER_02]: stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the hard part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hinnanit went to work very fast and we got
some really promising early results.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by the time we could turn those
results into a formulation that Michelle
[SPEAKER_02]: could use, she had already progressed to
organ failure and it was just too late for
[SPEAKER_02]: this to save her life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before she died in September of 2021,
sorry, yeah, 2021, she asked both of us to
[SPEAKER_02]: promise to keep pushing this work forward
in the hopes that we might find a cure for
[SPEAKER_02]: all the other women who are afflicted with
this disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Hinnanit and I are carrying this on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really mostly Hinnanit who is doing
the work, but I'm so happy that she's my
[SPEAKER_02]: partner in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy to continue after your
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we all know about cannabis and we
know that cannabis produces hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: different compounds and that we are
usually not sure what compounds are really
[SPEAKER_00]: important and more than that, what is the
preferred composition or the best
[SPEAKER_00]: composition to confer the entourage effect
that Dr. Russo was talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is especially in light of the
variety of different strains, cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that contains different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my lab, we ask what is the best
composition of active compounds for the
[SPEAKER_00]: optimized treatment of each medical
condition?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to answer that, in my lab what we do
is we extract cannabis from different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We separate the extracts to fractions and
by that we are able to separate and
[SPEAKER_00]: simplify in a way the chemical composition
and to ask the question what compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: what composition of compounds are working
best on biological essays of iron cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: indeed is the second most common and the
most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Western world and very few women survive
five years after diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only little, little is known
about the activity of cannabis against the
[SPEAKER_00]: iron cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely the active compounds were not
identified before we started our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, what we did is we looked
for different strains in order to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: best ones that are mostly active against
of iron cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked for cell viability of iron
cancer cells of several cell lines and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were able to identify one of the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it is DQ which is a high THC
strain and we found that this strain is
[SPEAKER_00]: highly active in comparison to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we fractionated the extract and were
able to find and to identify the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: fractions that are highly active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following chemical analysis, we were able
to determine the API, the formulation that
[SPEAKER_00]: is highly active in terms of cytotoxic
activity against of iron cancer cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: the formulation contained mostly THC,
some CBC and just a little bit of CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to prove that indeed this is the
active composition, what we did is we then
[SPEAKER_00]: used purified phytocannabinoids in this
composition, in this ratio in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: prove that indeed this composition is the
active one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, once we used phytocannabinoids
only, and remember this is originated from
[SPEAKER_00]: a fraction which contains many more
compounds rather than only this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yet when we reestablished this
composition using purified
[SPEAKER_00]: phytocannabinoids, then activity was
gained as much as in the fraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this led us to the understanding that
the actual active compounds are these ones
[SPEAKER_00]: in these certain ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following, we have determined using
antagonists and inverse agonists and
[SPEAKER_00]: blockers, we determined receptors that may
mediate a cannabis activity, a F7
[SPEAKER_00]: diffraction and also the standard mix SM,
and we found that CB2 is mostly involved
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was some evidences for TRPV2 as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is most reasonable to treat
patients with iron cancer, the treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: will not rely on cannabis only,
but rather cannabis will be used as a
[SPEAKER_00]: co-treatment with another chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we have examined the activity
of cannabis, of diffraction, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard mix with different
chemotherapies, we found a synergy with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them, and in this talk today,
I will focus on the PAP1 inhibitor,
[SPEAKER_00]: niraparib, niraparib is the second line of
treatment of of iron cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we could find is that the actual
diffraction, diffraction and not the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard mix, but the fraction itself from
the plant led to synergy with niraparib,
[SPEAKER_00]: so what we see here is sensitive
sensitization of ovarian cancer cells to
[SPEAKER_00]: the PAP1 inhibitor niraparib.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we wanted to examine the activity of
the combination of diffraction and
[SPEAKER_00]: niraparib against normal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to show that this combination
was 50 times more active on cancer cells
[SPEAKER_00]: than on normal cells, these were
keratinotides in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were able to show that the
combination of cannabis fraction and
[SPEAKER_00]: niraparib was indeed active more than
niraparib only on Michelle's cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells were isolated from Michelle's tumor
and were shifted to Israel to my lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: and indeed you can see the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have conducted in vivo study and
conducting additional ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already in the first experiment,
there was an advantage for the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis with niraparib, avastin was added
in this case, versus a tritone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A treatment with niraparib and avastin
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wanted to get deeper and to
better understand the mode of action of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and niraparib against ovarian
cancer in vivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we showed that the activity
is conveyed via apoptosis and not necrosis
[SPEAKER_00]: or other form of cell death, but rather
indeed there is an induction of apoptosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially by the combination of niraparib
and the cannabis fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following, we have looked at the wind
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind pathway is deeply associated with
cancer in general and ovarian cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ovarian cancer in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, the combination of F7 of
cannabis fraction and niraparib led to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction, to significant reduction in
some of the components of the wind
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway, including the receptor,
which the frizzled receptor, FZ,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the drawing here, which is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a activation of the wind pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis, by its own, by the way,
and the combination of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: niraparib reduced significantly the
expression of the receptor and additional
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also showed that the combination of
cannabis and niraparib, F7 and niraparib
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to relocation of proteins,
beta-catenin, in this case again,
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the wind pathway, relocation to
the cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This and others are very important
features of the mesenchymal to epithelial
[SPEAKER_00]: transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mesenchymal phenotype cells are those that
are related and responsible to metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are usually resistant to
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once these cells were treated with F7 and
niraparib, the mesenchymal features
[SPEAKER_00]: changed to epithelial features.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is associated usually with cells that
are not metastasizing and are not
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indeed, we suggested that cannabis
treatment of the varian cancer cells
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the proportion of the mesenchymal
cell and increase proportion of apoptotic
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is by altering the wind pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all published.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was published last year in Molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But following, we wanted to go even
deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the mode of action of F7 and
niraparib.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, what we did is we
sequenced cells from two cell lines of
[SPEAKER_00]: varian cancer that were treated with the
combination of F7 and niraparib.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found hundreds of different genes and
several dozens of genetic pathways that
[SPEAKER_00]: were significantly altered by the F7 plus
niraparib treatment in both cell lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These biological and signaling pathways
that were altered suggested some features
[SPEAKER_00]: of activity of F7 and niraparib that were
verified and are still being verified in
[SPEAKER_00]: an ongoing research and these included,
for example, inhibition of cell migration
[SPEAKER_00]: and differences in cytoskeleton F acting
rearrangements and led to a better and
[SPEAKER_00]: more comprehensive understanding of the
activity of F7 and niraparib and the basis
[SPEAKER_00]: of their synergy and the ability of
cannabis to synthesize cells to
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy PowerPoint inhibitor in this
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I summarize in few words,
we have started with many different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, many different strains and the
inability to determine what compounds are
[SPEAKER_00]: active and what compositions are the
optimal ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using different bioassays, chemical
analysis, we were able to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation of API and get deeper into the
targets and mode of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: These, of course, have to go through
toxicity studies and additional in vivo to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the actual activity and the
ability to go into clinical trials and,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, only successful clinical trials
will prove effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the actual formulations that were
identified might serve as a base for
[SPEAKER_00]: chemophiles of cannabis that will be
optimal for treatment of this and other
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the information on the API formulation
may be translated, and I hope it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: translated in the future, not just into
new cannabis-based products that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: specific and at pharmaceutical grades,
but rather this information would serve as
[SPEAKER_00]: a base for breeding for new cannabis
chemophiles with certain activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I would like to thank my
team in the lab and especially Nurit
[SPEAKER_00]: Shalev, Nurit, which is with us today,
and she's leading this research in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have time for questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blows my mind that this specific set of
cannabinoids in this ratio is suddenly so
[SPEAKER_01]: active.
[SPEAKER_01]: How specific is it or how have you ever
tested the tolerance of these kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: specific ratios to see how close you have
to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did, and indeed I did not show
that here, but what we did is determine
[SPEAKER_00]: the range of ratios that we need to use in
order to have synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely what I showed you is just an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, and it's an estimate, so you can
understand that three quarters should be
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and a quarter should be, and so on,
CBC and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we carefully determined the
boundaries of synergy, and by that,
[SPEAKER_00]: using these four components, we could draw
the synergy in terms of activity and
[SPEAKER_00]: between the four cannabis compounds,
but also with niraparib.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
