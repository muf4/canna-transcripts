[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head over to canmedevents.com now to learn
all about our CanMed 2022 event,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will take place May 3rd,
through 5th, at the Pasadena Convention
[SPEAKER_00]: Center in Pasadena, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This three-day event begins with a
full-day medical practicum led by Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnie Goldstein, the practicum's
originator, as well as Dr. Dustin Sulak,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Kevin Spellman, and Eloise Thiessen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of the presenters will share the
latest research, as well as their clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and practice guidelines related
to cannabinoid therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new section of this eight-hour course is
dedicated to reviewing different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions, products, and optimal dosing
for cannabinoid therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we have two full days of
presentations and panel discussions
[SPEAKER_00]: covering the latest research in the
cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and safety testing taking place May 4th
and 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full schedule is up at canmedevents
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that each of the CanMed
focus areas are anchored by a keynote
[SPEAKER_00]: presenter, Dr. Ethan Russo for science,
Seth Crawford for cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Bonnie Goldstein for medicine,
and Grace Bandong for safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of our keynotes, as well as many of
our presenters and panelists, were guests
[SPEAKER_00]: on the podcast, and you can listen to all
our previous episodes at canmedevents.com
[SPEAKER_00]: slash coffee talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're at CanMed events,
you can also watch video presentations and
[SPEAKER_00]: panel discussions from all of our previous
CanMed events in our CanMed video archive.

Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look for CanMed events.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode's guest is Dr. Deddy Miri.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deddy runs a lab at the Technion Israel
Institute of Technology that investigates
[SPEAKER_00]: the anti-tumor effects of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: More specifically, his team identifies
which combination of cannabinoids can kill
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most notably, his team identified a
combination of three specific cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that kill leukemia cells, and that
formulation is currently being tested in a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deddy is a three-time CanMed presenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently, he delivered a one-hour
keynote presentation at CanMed 2019 where
[SPEAKER_00]: he talks about the work going on in his
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend watching that in all of
Deddy's presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is the information fascinating,
but Deddy has a very engaging presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: style.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watch Deddy's 2017 presentation
video, you might actually see a cameo from
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain podcast host at about 30 seconds
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Deddy and I discussed a number of
topics related to his work, including the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that Deddy entered the cannabis
medicine research space skeptical of its
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic potential and how
understanding the mechanism of action for
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system made him a
believer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also talks about how he uses his own
experience, being a skeptic, to convince
[SPEAKER_00]: other skeptical physicians and
non-physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about the database that his team
created that tracks all the active
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds in medical cannabis products
available in Israel, as well as which
[SPEAKER_00]: products are effectively treating the
patient's conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unique database allows Deddy and his
team to identify which products and
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds they want to study in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the diversity of cannabis
chemotypes and the diversity of cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: types, and how that combination makes it
nearly impossible for patients to select
[SPEAKER_00]: the right strain for the right type of
cancer given what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also talk about whether synthetic
biology will be used to produce minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids at scale, and also the two
broad classifications for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, one for general wellness using
whole plant extracts, and another for
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted treatments using individual
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with Dr.
Deddy Meary, I wanted to thank this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's sponsor, Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Founded in 1999, Advanced Nutrients was
the first to develop a complete nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: system that unlocks the true genetic
potential of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since its inception, the brand has
introduced more than 50 innovations to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation community and continues to
revolutionize the space through
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary scientific discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at advancednutrients.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deddy Meary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Deddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I'm glad that we got to do this
because I feel like it's long overdue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been an important contributor to
CanMed and the cannabis community for a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad we finally got the chance to
talk on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in preparation for the conversation,
I rewatched your keynote presentation from
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I highly recommend all the listeners
check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll drop a link in the show description
so people can see the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that talk, you were very open in
sharing that you were skeptical when you
[SPEAKER_00]: first started researching medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious, first, what got you
started in researching medical cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And second, was there a particular moment
or discovery that made you a believer?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will start from the first question.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background is from medicinal plant
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a PhD in molecular and genetic plant
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a son of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in the fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the head of the Botanic Gardens of
Tel Aviv University and the medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: plant greenhouse there, which is a big
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I moved to my postdoc where I did
totally different work when I did the
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer research or anti-cancer properties
of different molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got back to Israel and I got my
own lab, I want to create a heterogenic
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory or multidisciplinary
laboratory, taking my knowledge from plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to see how it's affecting cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, I'm not the one that
invented most of the chemotherapies and
[SPEAKER_01]: the treatments against cancer coming from
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paxil is from Paxus and Bush, and
Vincrestin, Vimblastin, these are names
[SPEAKER_01]: for the major chemotherapies are all
coming from plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started to look for plants that I
thought that they have anti-cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started to work with a few plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them was cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a work by Manuel Guzman and
Christine Sanchez from Spain that showed
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you put cannabis on breast cancer
or on glioblastoma, every one of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: Manuel Guzman worked on glioblastoma and
Christine Sanchez on breast cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: showed that if you put the cannabis on
them, it's a inhibit their ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: migrate and create metastasis and
glioblastoma, it's kill the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started by repeating these
experiments and I was quite surprised by
[SPEAKER_01]: the results and quite fast being,
it's funny to say that in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: field, but become addicted to this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's phenomenal results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I will answer the second question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started very skeptical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a user, I'm not against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried a few times, I didn't like the
feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I have a friend that's saying that
I don't like to do things that I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not against, I just didn't,
I don't like the feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of, I don't want to say
gimmick because in the times in 2014,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't the hype yet and nobody,
it was kind of undercover and detecting on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Institute that I'm working with,
that really didn't like that I'm working
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first result were extremely,
extremely significant and strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the first conference that I fly,
it was in Prague, it was around 90 people,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of the founders of these fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were the people that just
established Kronos and Aurora and Canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: and Tilray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember they showed that they are
starting to plant in Tilray, they started
[SPEAKER_01]: to plant like two acres of cannabis and
everybody hold their heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was very skeptical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting there and saying,
for one hand, they're showing that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: make you sleepy for the others say,
hey, they said it's make you alert,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's helping diabetes, it's helping pain,
it's helping epilepsy, it's helping
[SPEAKER_01]: psoriasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on guys, like maybe really all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too good to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too good to be true and also understanding
how biology is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's doing that, it won't be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the opposite, it's not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learning and understanding the
endocannabinoid system, its role and how
[SPEAKER_01]: it's operating every cell and how
complicated it is, explaining why it's
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing pain, affecting sleep,
reducing increased appetite, affecting the
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you understand the mechanism of
action of the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're asking me what's trigger me
or convince me about that everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: I see or a lot of things that we see is
real, is understanding the mechanism of
[SPEAKER_01]: action of the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you understand how why it's
doing that and how, then you believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before you're asking this,
the next question, you know, you give to
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists to speak, you won't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm finding myself give and I'm not
exaggerating hundreds of talks and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of them, it's in hospitals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm sitting in front of the
physicians, in the beginning, there is the
[SPEAKER_01]: same joke always did you brought samples,
everybody's laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then I'm starting to show the
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is always this kind of the
stopping this, Daddy, come on,
[SPEAKER_01]: really, you really think it's doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm starting to explaining in the
highest level of science and that
[SPEAKER_01]: physician can understand why it's working
like that, which, you know, which
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors operate what, which cannabinoid
binding, what is happening downstream to
[SPEAKER_01]: that and what is the mechanism of action
there is always the moment in the stock
[SPEAKER_01]: and I did hundreds of that and never had
the different something that happened
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a moment that they know that I
have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They understood it's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from here, it's easy to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to start to engage them to
prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to engage them to work and to
give data and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a logic behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that reason, it's easy to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what about non-physicians?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there is there something that when
you're speaking with them that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: explain that kind of helps it click if
someone who is a non-clinician is a
[SPEAKER_00]: skeptic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, when you give something that
somebody can connect to it and understand
[SPEAKER_01]: it, then it's become easier to believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I will now explain you one,
why, when you smelling a barbecue,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's increased your appetite and they
actually, the cannabis is doing exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, yeah, I know that I'm smelling a
barbecue or, you know, I'm, I'm feeling an
[SPEAKER_01]: appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's increased my appetite or a dish or
why I'm eating a dessert after the meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when I'm not hungry anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm explaining by the evolution what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why it's happening and why the
cannabis just mimic them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can connect to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say, I know that there, you know,
I'm full.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they bring this, you know,
great brownies in the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm eating that also not make sense,
you know, or things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and what is the different
between when you, you know, feel pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: why, when our body operates the opioid
system, we have an opioid system in our
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's operate, the end of
cannabinoid system and why now we can use
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis when it's fit to that and use
opioid when it's fit to that and not
[SPEAKER_01]: opioid to everything, you know,
I can explain it in a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that reason, I think everybody can
connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's, it's challenging in
conferences that there are physicians,
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists, you know, fathers and mothers
of a sick child and a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you need to give the talk that the
physician will admire what you're saying
[SPEAKER_01]: and not say, Hey, this is a lame guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, you know, the grower and the
father of a child, a sick child will
[SPEAKER_01]: understand you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not an easy mission,
but I must say that I'm enjoying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just to plug your keynote from
2019, I think you do a very good job of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of explaining it for everyone in the
audience, because we do have a diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: audience at the, at the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just another plug for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to get into talking about your
laboratory, because I mean, at least for
[SPEAKER_00]: me, it seems quite unique, especially
comparing it to labs that we have testing
[SPEAKER_00]: labs that we have here in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it true that all cannabis grown in
Israel goes through your lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had, I was fortunate to get a huge
amount of money from from a foundation in
[SPEAKER_01]: the state that gave money for a
breakthrough, you know, science to create
[SPEAKER_01]: the Israeli database on patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got $5 million to create a big
database in academia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge money, at least in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did until last year,
we had just eight authorized growers that
[SPEAKER_01]: can supply, you know, Israel, in Israel,
we have just medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis, we don't have
recreational at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's under health care from 2007.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's under health care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel is a half social country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all have insurance, whether it's
dedicated from my salary, or the
[SPEAKER_01]: government will pay you if you're not
working, you know, so we all have
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance when I'm going to a physician or
when I'm going to the hospital,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not paying, I already paid,
you know, for my salary, or the
[SPEAKER_01]: government, we all been insured.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the health care in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is being prescribed by
physician under health care, and you get
[SPEAKER_01]: in in pharmacy as a prescribed medicine,
which is saying that you're paying a fixed
[SPEAKER_01]: price that the government decided,
which not related to the amount that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting, and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very simple, but it's all under
health care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every, every product need to go through a
specific test in order to be in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacy, like, like every medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that process, everything is reaching
to my lab, we examine all the active
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, and then creating a database
with the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can speak about that for five hours,
there is something that is saying in
[SPEAKER_01]: creating a big data garbage in garbage
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little bit garbage in because
the data that we get from the patient is
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very problematic in the way being
collected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that reason, there are things that
we succeed to recruit from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: not in the level that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, comparing that to what we have
here in the United States, where multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: different states with multiple different
systems, summer medical, summer
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational labs are testing for,
for some compounds in one state and not in
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty unique that you're able to
put together a database to really start
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking, you know, what types of,
what types of cannabis folks are using for
[SPEAKER_00]: certain conditions and to try to,
to actually draw some correlations between
[SPEAKER_00]: what the active compounds are responsible
for the response, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing kind of a reverse biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I see what's happened on the
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm taking it to mice, you know,
it's, it's usually the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so this is something that from the
beginning was very unique to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started with the materials that
actually patients are already getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when I started, there were
18,000 patients in Israel today,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are 105,000, so five times more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, but there were still 18,000
patients that getting these materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not toxic, but I see that they
killed the cancer cells very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started, usually when you're
studying in the lab, you see something
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have a lot of efficacy and kill
the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you will go to mice model and then to
humans, the first trial and the most tough
[SPEAKER_01]: one is toxicity, which side effects that
you're getting, whether, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's killed the cancer cell, but also kill
your liver and your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is very good materials that kill
everything, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're blocking your oxygen will
kill the cancer cells, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, but this is not what you're looking,
but here there was something was potent is
[SPEAKER_01]: the best chemotherapies that they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that it's already patient
taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is extremely unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the same level, I can say if I know
that these strain causing 67% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient to be sleepy and to sleep very
deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can take it to the lab and starting
to examine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which cannabinoids or in which molecules
inside is causing the, what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism of infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it cause you to feel sleepy,
to sleep deep, to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: which, when we're talking about sleep,
there are different part of the sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: how fast you falling asleep, how deep you,
you're sleeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fall asleep very fast,
but wake up every few minutes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're getting this, the REM sleep,
whether you are, it's efficient sleep or
[SPEAKER_01]: not, how, how, how difficult it's for you
to wake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is these are being controlled in
different areas of the brain and different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of cannabis affecting different
areas in different part of the sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you ask just the patient,
does it help you to sleep?
[SPEAKER_01]: You will get an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes or no, but you don't know in which
part of the sleep it's affecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is taking you to different
resolution of questions and answers in
[SPEAKER_01]: fine tune, which patient should get what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we mentioned cancer and I wanted to get
into that because correct me if I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: but your team has identified a combination
of compounds that are very efficient at
[SPEAKER_00]: killing very specific types of cancer,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's what you presented on in
2019 and have you been able to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: other similar formulations or different
ones that can be equally as effective
[SPEAKER_00]: against other types of cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I want to take one step backward
and here to the audience, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is not killing cancer and
cannabis is not a treatment to cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, many people say why to take
chemotherapy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not working that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cancer is a given name to hundreds of
different diseases, you know, breast
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer, liver cancer, papriatic cancer are
totally different diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what can help on breast cancer can
damage ovarian cancer, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they work differently.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the drug that they're working today on
breast cancer, let's say tamoxifen is
[SPEAKER_01]: working exactly the opposite on ovarian
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't understand that unless
you're oncologist or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, cancer is the given name
to hundreds of different diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the same type of cancer,
let's say breast cancer, you have hormonal
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive hair loss, BRCA mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have more than 20 different types of
breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which one cannabis is killing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what we call personal medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we'll go to the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are hundreds and thousands different
types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the possibility that you have a
specific types of a breast cancer that you
[SPEAKER_01]: will take the specific types of cannabis
that really interfere with the pathway of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cell to block it and to kill it or to
stop proliferation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lottery.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that reason, without really
knowing deeply what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's better sometimes not to do.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we define in my lab, and we're
working on more than 10 different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer, but at least in three types of
cancer, we already succeed to understand,
[SPEAKER_01]: to screen hundreds of different chemovars
of cannabis to describe one of them or
[SPEAKER_01]: discover one of them that was very
efficient killing the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for this one to analyze and to
separate it to understand which molecules,
[SPEAKER_01]: which cannabinoids is responsible for the
effect, understand the mechanism of
[SPEAKER_01]: action, which receptors are binding,
what they're doing in the cell and why
[SPEAKER_01]: they're killing these types of cells with
this mutation, not the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are starting clinical trials in
humans in this indication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in leukemia specific types of leukemia
in breast cancer and colon cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are having advanced results that we're
already taking to clinical phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but this is very specific in
leukemia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about three molecules in
breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very unique cannabinoids,
a little bit similar to CBG, but with
[SPEAKER_01]: different structure and two oxygen in the
armatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, because there are two oxygens,
there is less hydrophobic, more available,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a unique cannabinoids where the first
one to discover and, and to analyze it and
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, this is what we call minor
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not always it's minor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there are strains that in this
one, they are not minor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just call them like that because we
don't identify them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have standards for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yes, going to the bottom of your
questions in specific types of cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've already found specific molecules
that affecting these cancer because of
[SPEAKER_01]: their special phenotype or mutation,
you know, every cancer have his own
[SPEAKER_01]: correct reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we define molecules that
affecting these types of cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: now it's very specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one, we're starting clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to the minor cannabinoids,
and you sort of, you mentioned that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're considered minor for one reason,
because we're not specifically testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: them, but are they also in very low
concentrations in the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, first of all, in my lab,
we divide them as major, medium and minor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So major, it's in CBD, maybe also CBG,
you know, we see strains of 20% CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: already, so it's not minor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just came back from the state and I saw
that in California and also in New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are strains of 20% CBG in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm familiar with that in the last few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 20% is not minor for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are the, what we call the
medium one, which is CBC and CBN and TB
[SPEAKER_01]: and CBDV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually you can find strains with a
two, 3% of these cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're already so strains of 13,
14% TB and 30, 14% CBDV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are kind of medium, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are the minor cannabinoids,
they are probably degradation of the major
[SPEAKER_01]: and the medium or a specific cannabinoid
that usually you're not finding them more
[SPEAKER_01]: than 0.5% or something like that in the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this we call minor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found out that sometimes they are
extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes they are more potent than the
usual ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're taking them, isolating
them or creating strains with high
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of them, they are very,
very efficient in specific indication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is our claim of fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what I'm focusing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that THC and CBD and CBG
are not important, but the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking on the special one that I
can see in other notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the reason, it's not that THC
and CBD and CBG are not important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, when I'm finding amazing
results with CBG, I will go with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm quite upset when it's THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is the case sometimes that they are
involved in sort of the combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, given the fact that some of these
minor cannabinoids that are in relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: low concentrations could be very important
in these treatments, I'm curious,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are your thoughts on synthetic
biology, like creating some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids through yeast or things like
that as a way to, you know, make more of
[SPEAKER_00]: these than the plant is typically
producing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, I don't find an advantage
by creating them in yeast or creating them
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetically in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the plant, there is the entourage
effect and something that you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can speak about that later if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a bunch of cannabinoids going
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look on high CBD strain,
there is a portfolio of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: theropinoids that will go with that if you
look in high THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you are, you know, taking an
extract or using a vipering or viping or
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking cannabis, you're getting this
whole complex that there is plus and minus
[SPEAKER_01]: in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're taking an isolate cannabinoids,
so I don't find a difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate from yeast or make it synthetic,
isolate and purifying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we ask, what is the advantage of
creating that in yeast or in bacteria on
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, I think that we will find
out in a few years from now, different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of medicine that's coming out from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is whole extract when people
using for
[SPEAKER_01]: not recreational, but for quality of life,
improving quality of life and wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're taking the whole extract
and it's a little bit help you with sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: with pain, with a mood, with a,
you know, appetite, you're getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of effects that affecting your
quality of life, which each one of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a different combination of molecules
that you have in the whole extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a benefit of that instead of
taking five drugs, taking cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a little bit here, a little bit
there, and you're getting something and
[SPEAKER_01]: you improving your quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I totally, I think that 80% or even
more of the patient that getting today,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and also in the recreational,
you know, we can argue if recreation,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not part of healthcare or part of
improve, if it's improving your quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: life, if you are very angry and you have
anxiety and now you're in the evening and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're smoking cannabis again,
being relaxed, does it medicinal or does
[SPEAKER_01]: it reaction, you know, it's a big
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, I think that 85% of the
user using that quality of life and
[SPEAKER_01]: wellness and the other 15% using it as to
treat specific indication like epilepsy or
[SPEAKER_01]: what we spoke now, cancer and maybe other
indication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for these ones, we will be
much more accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be specific combination of
cannabinoids or specific molecules that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be from the plant, but might be also
from yeast or synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see if you already purifying them
and using as purified, from my point of
[SPEAKER_01]: view, I don't see a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's such an important point is
kind of talking about the two different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways you can use cannabis, one for general
wellness and one for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: treating very specific conditions that
you're looking for with your team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think sometimes in the industry kind
of becomes an either or is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is big pharma gonna come in and
sort of take over cannabis or should it
[SPEAKER_00]: stay, you know, kind of like it is now
with whole plant extracts and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the benefits of the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like there's really a space
for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is space for both and we
need both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when you have a child with
leukemia and you have phase six with TLL
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have six months to live,
I don't think that either of us want to
[SPEAKER_01]: play games with that, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to give him the treatment,
the most serious treatment that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: give to save his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, and I don't care and I don't,
I care for the child, I don't care about
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry in that point, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Save the child.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you have accurate molecule
that you know exactly the dosage and how
[SPEAKER_01]: to give it, then you need to go the
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I have four kids and then
also a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that any of us will play now
with a, you know, herbal plant or let's
[SPEAKER_01]: see an entourage effect and I don't know
what there is, you know, we'll go with the
[SPEAKER_01]: physician.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, when you want to treat
something that is more general,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have now, you suffer from PTSD,
which is problem with anxiety and the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem of sleep and mood and other things
that cannabis give a treatment with is
[SPEAKER_01]: more complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't need now to kill a cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to stop something very
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need something more general.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, I will give you a different
example that I like to write that I
[SPEAKER_01]: started to see in Israel more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, older people, my parents are 85
years old and they're already,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, suffering from what older people
are suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit pains, more even than a
little bit, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't fall asleep very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what the meaning of 85,
you know, they're probably, even when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're singing them until 120,
it's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's a mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my mother don't have too much
appetite anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now she's taking cannabis,
high CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's sleeping better.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's eating better.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's feeling better.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is have less pains, nothing critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like taking opioid that the pain
is disappearing, but you reduce two levels
[SPEAKER_01]: down and you improve all the quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of taking a meal of pills,
that every one of them also create a
[SPEAKER_01]: different damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're taking a pill for that
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're taking, she taking few
drops of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that in that term,
we will be isolate cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules because you're talking about
variety of things that happened there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now six days ago, some girls entered
to my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a friend of a colleague.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, this is the next lab to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that you must help her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She came, she's suffering from insomnia.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a treatment of cancer from
chemotherapy and this chemotherapy caused
[SPEAKER_01]: her insomnia.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last five years, she can't sleep
more than 15 minutes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty woman, lovely woman, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a professor, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: She can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: She don't have, she just want,
she just asking one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help me to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's not pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one thing, help me to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I want to come with the big
cannons, whether from cannabis or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: to help her sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need the old variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the best molecules or the best
combination that will cause her to fall
[SPEAKER_01]: asleep and not wake up for four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can create it, I prefer to create
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I need two molecules, two molecules
from this train and one molecules from
[SPEAKER_01]: that train, maybe a molecule from algae.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's combination from one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to help her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we will find out more and
more complicated medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a different, you know,
a branch that I'm opening here of things
[SPEAKER_01]: to help this kind of patient, which is
treating very accurate in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give the best example is epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No kids with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have life, you know,
they can't operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just stop the seizures,
now they coming back to normal life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be one compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's the CBD like GWL or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're blocking that, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need the whole package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that you will find that we will
find out in few years that the pharmacy is
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a company really swallowing these
kinds of things when it's one compound,
[SPEAKER_01]: two compounds for a specific indication,
but the majority will stay with the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's such a, it's such an
interesting approach to is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a condition, you start treating
it with cannabis and it's sort of this
[SPEAKER_00]: like shotgun approach, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're getting a lot of different
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find a strain that works for
you, then you can really start to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow it down, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What compounds are in this strain and can
we start isolating it down and narrowing
[SPEAKER_00]: it down to just a select few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and it's great that you
guys can do that in Israel with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with your database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I, I, I come back to the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have 3.6 million medical
cannabis users here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine if you could get your hands on,
on that data, how much, how much more
[SPEAKER_00]: could we learn about, you know,
what cannabis can be used to treat other
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so the problem is the other side,
when somebody say cannabis today,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this has helped me to,
to treat the Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean I took cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's meaningless to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody's calling me from,
you know, from Boston a few weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with connection, he found out
that they asked me to speak with him and
[SPEAKER_01]: said, look, I used, I tried many types of
cannabis, and now I find one that really
[SPEAKER_01]: helped my father with Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's meaningless to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares what the name of these cannabis,
I don't know what are the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the dosage I want to reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless I will get it here and examine it
and start to work with it, I can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't get it here, right from
Boston, unless I'm going with the suitcase
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, and become criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the regulation is still
blocking that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The database, and I did it in the past
from Canada and from the state,
[SPEAKER_01]: the database that I'm getting is almost
meaningless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we published, I will give
you an example, we published a paper a few
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks ago, I think it's four weeks ago,
about the difference of sex, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: gender, sorry, not sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know from our database,
that women's have way more side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They saying that they have more side
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also they are using sometimes
different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are strains that just male using and
strains that just women use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we thought that the reason there is
more side effects is whether they're using
[SPEAKER_01]: a different strains that have more side
effects, or it's something related
[SPEAKER_01]: hormonalically, you know, to estrogen or
gestural testosterone, whatever that are
[SPEAKER_01]: different between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we have the ability today to
check the endocannabinoid system very
[SPEAKER_01]: deeply, we can look on 38 different
receptors and 150 endocannabinoids in the
[SPEAKER_01]: blood samples, and also can analyze all
the cannabinoids, what they are getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a clinical trial on 200 patients,
around, it was a little bit less than 200
[SPEAKER_01]: was around 160, it was something like 90
males and 70 women.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first of all, these were pain
patients, neuropathic pain patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, we look how many patients
using cannabis, we took neuropathic
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that using cannabis said that
it's helped them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a criteria, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started to check how much it's
helped them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find out that women and men describe
that it's the same on the effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we asked, okay, what about the
negative side effects that you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And women had a way more than men's
almost, men's almost didn't have side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're asking the woman,
okay, how you saying that these strain
[SPEAKER_01]: cause you dizziness, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much, how many times in a month you
feel dizziness?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, she said, what does,
you ask her, do you have a negative
[SPEAKER_01]: effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this strain cause me dizziness,
dizziness, it's writing monoterminology,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when your head is turning,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you are, she said, yes,
I have, I'm suffering from this side
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happened a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, okay, how many times a month you
feel dizziness?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said four times a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're going to the males that using
the same strain said, does it help you for
[SPEAKER_01]: pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it reduce pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a negative side effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't have negative side effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have dizziness?
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever done feeling this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times a month?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four times a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number is the same number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the problem of the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not getting deep, and you don't
ask the right question, you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we find out in the
database.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if you're not going deeper,
you're getting different answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this actually work show that there is
no difference in the side effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly the same, the same strains
causing the same side effects in women and
[SPEAKER_01]: men's lifting in what we checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't ask it in the right way,
you are falling and failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this is part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to come back just for a second,
what you said about having this ability
[SPEAKER_01]: from the database.
[SPEAKER_01]: The database give you just any hint or
clue where to start looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from there in the last six years,
we develop abilities to do extraction in
[SPEAKER_01]: many different types of extraction,
butane, CO2, supercritical, press,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, to learn what are the
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to analyze all the active
compounds, all the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids, stupinoids, and it's different
machine, different abilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we develop method to screen on many
different indication or diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually a scientist is focusing on one
thing, my supervisor for my patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: he said that an expert is somebody that
know everything about nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually you're expert for specific
types of cells in the heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how labs usually look at the
academia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the cannabis, because of the
variety, my lab started to do cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then said, okay, it's also working on
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a mice model for epilepsy and
for Alzheimer's, sleep disorder,
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple sclerosis, screen disorder,
autoimmune diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end I said, just a moment,
in order to look on medicinal plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: now there is also a hype on psychedelic
mushroom or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought about that four years ago,
I said, this is not just cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we create 20 models for diseases that
we can screen very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing extraction, analyzing the
active compounds, screen it on 20
[SPEAKER_01]: different diseases, every types of
cannabis or mushrooms or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: See where I see the effect, where I see
something unique that no other plant or no
[SPEAKER_01]: other strengths is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I find it, I know to separate,
to analyze the active compound,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are different machines that can
separate it and analyze, separate and
[SPEAKER_01]: define which molecules, what are the
combination of the molecules that doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether this is one, three, seven,
I can narrow it down very efficiently
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I narrow it down, I can ask,
okay, why and what these molecules are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing to the cells and to the mice and
whatever, okay, which receptors are
[SPEAKER_01]: binding, what they are doing, so
understanding the mechanism of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I have all these circles,
now I'm ready to convince the physician to
[SPEAKER_01]: do a clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the molecules, I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go to a clinical trials with the
whole extract which I know that I have the
[SPEAKER_01]: right combination in science and this is
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I can go on the pharma way,
purified compounds, FDA, and usually I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that at parallel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is advantage to both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm closing what I achieved or what
we have, I have in my lab 38 people today,
[SPEAKER_01]: 38 scientists and I have a company called
Canosol that have around 45 scientists
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So altogether, we're around 80,
90 scientists that can take a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's cannabis or other plants,
we're working with algae, mushrooms and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to go all the route, analyzing all the
active compounds, we call it metabolomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, doing extraction different
way, analyze the active compound,
[SPEAKER_01]: define the effect on cells or mice,
understand the mechanism of action,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing preclinical in mice and take it to
clinical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, I think it's opened a huge
window to a different approach of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants that are more complicated
than single molecule, single target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do wanna be mindful of your time,
Dedy, and I thank you again for taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I let you go, I wanna give you
an opportunity to share any websites,
[SPEAKER_00]: any social media, anything that you wanna
get out there to share with the audience
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they can stay in touch with you or
stay up on the work that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm a scientist,
I'm professor in the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is site for the lab, put my name and
you find it at the Technion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a company called Canosol and
Canosol have the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a synergism between what we're
doing in the lab and Canosol actually
[SPEAKER_01]: where one big group that doing R&D trying
to understand which component,
[SPEAKER_01]: how these component, which plant and how
they are working and to define the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that can help us to live better and to,
you know, smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, when we're coming to work,
me and my workers that we will come with a
[SPEAKER_01]: smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, when patients are getting to
hospitals or sick, we'll smile more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two approach that work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, it's working very well,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that sounds like a great
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for the time, Daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you out at CanMed in 2022
and many more to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I'm waiting that these
conferences will open again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just came back from after a
year and a half that I didn't fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came back from a tour in LA and New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sky is open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life is coming back, I hope, to normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to see you face to face soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
