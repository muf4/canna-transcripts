[SPEAKER_00]: So good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the opportunity to talk about
hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Zamir Prenja, and I'd like to
start with just an acknowledgement of our
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators and co-authors on this
particular presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is greenhouse-grown cannabis,
and this is the production system that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be talking about with regard to
spread of hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically greenhouse-grown cannabis,
and hoplite and viroid is a major problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just in Canada, but as many of you
know, also in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start out with some
symptomology pictures just to indicate
[SPEAKER_00]: what this viroid actually does to cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are obviously high THC lines,
and what you see here on the left is the
[SPEAKER_00]: first symptomology that you would
encounter in a vegetative plant that is
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, the stunting,
the shorter internodes, in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves are slightly darker green than
the healthy plant that's over on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be in highly susceptible
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily see those symptoms
in every cannabis variety or strain that's
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is a little bit later on when the
plants are starting to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be two weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see the plants are much
smaller, the leaves are dark green,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as you'll see in a few minutes,
the floral development is significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so growers do recognize symptomology
of hoplite early on, particularly in
[SPEAKER_00]: highly susceptible varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what obviously is the major
economic impact is when hoplite and viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: infected plants going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have much shorter inflorescences,
poorly developed, as you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you'll see later on, the yield goes
down, and so does the levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, in particular THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, a very obvious symptom
on highly susceptible genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the growers walk through,
they'll see the stunting, and obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: the term dudding has been used to describe
this poor development of the
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we also looked at trichomes,
and as all of you know, trichomes are
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously the most important feature in
cannabis plants that allow the production
[SPEAKER_00]: and accumulation of cannabinoids,
including THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you see a very nice comparison
between a healthy extract of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are trichomes that were collected
from dried flowers right before sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the impact of hoplite on
the production of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smaller, and they're not as well
developed as they should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, when you look at it under the
scanning electron microscope, you will see
[SPEAKER_00]: that, healthy compared to infected,
the actual trichome numbers aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see is a smaller development of
the trichome glands or the heads,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as you'll see in a minute,
reduced production of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a direct impact on trichome
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of infection by hoplite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is, a dramatic comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same variety of the same genotype,
infected versus healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The healthy large glandular heads full of
cannabinoids compared to their shriveled
[SPEAKER_00]: shrunken heads that are in hoplite and
viral infected plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are at the same magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just a reduction in size,
but also a reduction in volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously this has commercial impact
to growers because in Canada anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC levels are driving the economic value
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's some data to illustrate not
just the trichome head size, but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: length of the stalks is reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the most important feature
is THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you see here on the right,
THC content goes down from approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: 18% in this genotype to about 11%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost a 40% reduction in the
production of THC specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, not really sure what the impact
is on the trichomes directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be an indirect effect with poor
growth, or there could be a shutdown in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the metabolic pathways leading up
to THC production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Detection of hoplite and viral is fairly
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most commercial labs have developed PCL
primers and kits that will detect this
[SPEAKER_00]: thyroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: 256 base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you heard in the first talk this
morning, you get the dimers, the monomers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dimers, the trimmers, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to see this multiple banding
pattern in very susceptible and highly
[SPEAKER_00]: infected plants, which suggests that the
replication is going at a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these dimers and trimmers accumulate
as a result.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice in this plant that the viroid
is everywhere, going from the lower leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: to the middle leaf to the top leaf,
as well as in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, this is a systemically
infected plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'll do today is I'm going to talk
to you about what this viroid does,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it moves, first of all, from mother
plant to cuttings, from pruning wounds
[SPEAKER_00]: into stem infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about movement from
stems into roots, from roots throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, causing systemic infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about spread through
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question came up earlier this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this thing spread naturally?
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads through water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads through flowers, both male and
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads into trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads into seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you'll see at the end, we've also
confirmed that tobacco and tomato plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are susceptible to hoplite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of material here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it is bad news in the sense that
this viroid really is a stable entity
[SPEAKER_00]: capable of extremely rapid spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will talk about management methods
as I get towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so one of the major problems,
of course, is mother plants, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: used to derive cuttings, can be
systemically infected, as you see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way through, but yet not show any
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that mother plant isn't reduced in
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any physical manifestation
that it's infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no stunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants are maintained,
obviously, by the growers because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where they make the cuttings from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet, when you look at the tissues in
the plant, the viroid is present
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, in the roots, in the leaves,
in the stems, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know, and others have observed,
too, that when you take cuttings from
[SPEAKER_00]: these infected plants, the cuttings don't
root as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here, again, you see very small
root production as opposed to the healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some theories about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, gene silencing and other
mechanisms that would explain reduced root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth could be occurring in these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you start out with a cutting
that has fewer roots, then clearly it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to be a plant that yields as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows you the influence of cuttings
from three different genotypes 14 days
[SPEAKER_00]: after rooting was initiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: On transmission of the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, every single cutting
from every single genotype that started
[SPEAKER_00]: from an infected mother is infected with
hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the very, very consistent
banding patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is obviously a very,
very major concern for growers in that
[SPEAKER_00]: your cuttings from an infected mother are
all going to be infected if the plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within 14 days after the cuttings are
initiated, we can take the roots and every
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them has hoplite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also done mechanical transmission
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do here is try to emulate what
growers would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is when they take cuttings with
shears, they leave a wound site such as
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be a practical way to
demonstrate transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took infectious sap and added it to the
exposed cut stem and monitored the spread
[SPEAKER_00]: of the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see here is that at points
one and six, whoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So point one being the top of the plant
and six being the roots are the two areas
[SPEAKER_00]: that first picked up the viroid when the
inoculation was made roughly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of spread apparently up
into this area, but mostly down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots as you see here in number six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is after two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you monitor this over time,
what you start to see at four weeks is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are starting to see much more
spread of the viroid and not just now into
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots, which is the arrows,
but also into the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the period of two to four weeks,
it's now spreading from the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant up into the rest of the foliage in
that particular direction, regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genotype that you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get to six weeks,
every single part of the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, very uniform infection here
in different genotypes over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: L is leaf and R is root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the theory then is if you
introduce it here at a point of
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation, you are going to see a
downward spread, which is the yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: arrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets down into the roots in two
weeks, you're going to see upward spread,
[SPEAKER_00]: the red arrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on where you sample in a
systemic plant four weeks, you'll see it
[SPEAKER_00]: up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then six weeks, it's through the
entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does vary by genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies by environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies by other factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this indicates that in a mother plant
from a cutting, in six weeks, that plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be systemically infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not different from what you
would see in the literature with regard to
[SPEAKER_00]: how viruses and viroids spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a given point of inoculation,
you can see the arrows, some of the arrows
[SPEAKER_00]: going up, but primarily going down into
the root zone and then up back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this reflects flow, transport
through the phloem, as well as transport
[SPEAKER_00]: through the plasmodesmata from cell to
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very consistent with what's known for
other viruses and in viroids in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think that mechanical
transmission, and that is lateral spread,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a big deal or important in this viroid
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just shows you the systemic spread
from inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two plants right next to one another,
rubbing against another, a person touching
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant, moving over to this plant,
we don't see a lot of transmission in that
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really, really good news,
because this is not a TMV.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't spread like TMV.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears that it does need a pretty good
wound site on a stem, or as you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: later on in the root, in order for it to
transmit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mechanical transmission through simply
rubbing or plants being next to one
[SPEAKER_00]: another does not seem to transmit this
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would explain what growers have
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't see these outbreaks as a result
of mechanical transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is just a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning wounds seem to be very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical abrasions of leaves, plants
brushing up against one another,
[SPEAKER_00]: does not seem to be important for spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly pruning tools seem to be the
most likely way in which this viroid is
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading in a cannabis facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we wanted to demonstrate
was that root transmission is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did here was we took an
infected plant and a healthy plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: drew them in these corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were physically separated from one
another, except for the hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: solution that was floating around these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within two weeks, the plant on the
right started to pick up the viroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting that movement through the
nutrient solution was possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We repeated the experiment in the
greenhouse environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, infected plants, healthy plant,
physically separated, we flooded this tray
[SPEAKER_00]: three times a day or twice a day and
monitored to see spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within two weeks, 20% spread occurred
from the infected root system over to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% is significant when you have a million
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not sound like a lot in terms of
numbers, but it's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this viroid is probably getting
sloughed off in root cells, maybe in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root cap, in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think that it's necessarily
viruses that are exuded out or viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: that's exuded out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably fragments of roots,
as you see here, floating around in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution that is allowing this
viroid to spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also detected hoplite and viroid in
many places in the growing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area here under the root zone on the
table contains hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: These emitters on the irrigation system
has hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, root fragments that come
off the plants have hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recirculated water, as I'll show you in
the next slide, also has presence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this thing moves quite well on the
surface of tables between plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being shared with the same irrigation
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you see recirculated irrigation
water, very faint but positive bands,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that the viroid is present in this
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also done QPCR with this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned earlier, the area right
underneath the slabs of the plants right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, the reading on a QPCR machine was
around 25, which is fairly significant,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost equivalent to what you see in the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then swabs of the table surface,
water samples, residual water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and recirculated water are all positive
for hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our estimate to try to
determine exactly how many viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: particles we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done with synthetically derived
RNA trying to explain how the QPCR
[SPEAKER_00]: readings correlate with viroid
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so approximately a QPCR reading of
around 20 gives you about a million viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at at least 100,000 or so
particles or fragments of RNA present.
[SPEAKER_00]: on those tabletops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, going through the literature,
it's not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many viruses and even viroids
that are transmitted through water.
[SPEAKER_00]: A potato spindle tuba viroid, for example,
when you grow these plants next to one
[SPEAKER_00]: another, a healthy plant here or infected
plant here, a healthy plant there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will see lateral transmission through
roots, through water, through various
[SPEAKER_00]: other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not unique to this particular
viroid or to this particular host pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other viroids do similar things as far as
movement through water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were surprised with this finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a situation where my student,
because they wanted to save on the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and economics, they used these
disposable pestles, which is supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be used once and thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they decided to hang onto them and
autoclave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after every cycle of autoclaving,
we checked to see whether the hoplite
[SPEAKER_00]: environment was present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, a cycle of autoclaving
does not destroy this particular viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found it in the buckets that we
used to store our nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found it on the surface of these
handheld watering cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all positive for hoplite and
viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to be aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing does stick around on utensils
and equipment in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what happens when a cannabis plant
goes into flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: As most of you probably know, in order to
flower a cannabis plant, you have to move
[SPEAKER_00]: it over to a 12-12 cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to show that when you do
that, look at the presence of hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid FL.
[SPEAKER_00]: FL stands for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much so that when you compare the
movement of hoplite and viroid in a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's flowering compared to a plant
that's still in vegetative growth after
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks, you do find it in the roots at
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 12-12 cycle, every single part of
the plant is infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something has happened in the process
of flowering, the physiological changes
[SPEAKER_00]: that occur during a flowering cycle that
actually causes this viroid to spread and
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply and replicate considerably into
these flowering tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, again, is just some data,
QPCR data, to show you that when you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at a plant that's under a 12-12 cycle,
the QPCR numbers are way, way lower than
[SPEAKER_00]: they are when the plant is under a 24-hour
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, suggesting the shift over,
the physiological shift, into flowering is
[SPEAKER_00]: causing this viroid to replicate,
to move, and potentially become
[SPEAKER_00]: symptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at dried flower samples,
flower samples that would be making their
[SPEAKER_00]: way to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoplite and viroid is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's moving up into the flowers,
it's also going to be in the dried flower
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned earlier, these are the
trichomes that are produced on flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues of cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next question we asked,
can this thing move into the trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made collections of trichomes from
infected plants, as well as from healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and looked at them to make sure
they were pure trichome preparations,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then extracted the RNA to see whether
hoplite and viroid was present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, hoplite and viroid is
present in the trichomes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted from these plants that are
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the trichome glands, a beautiful
image showing you these bulbs that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the arrow basically tells you that as
the plant goes into flower, the viroid is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually moving along into these
particular tissues, which is perhaps not
[SPEAKER_00]: surprising, given how easy it is to spread
in a plant, but still quite surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you look at the literature,
one can find lots of reports of where
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome formation is a photosynthetic
sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of energy demand that goes
into these trichome development,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's simply a matter of the viroid
finding its way through there as the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthes flow from the bract tissues
into trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would explain why we're seeing so
much of it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much so that even the resin,
that is extracted from these infected
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, has hoplite and viroid in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are different resin extraction
methods, mostly CO2 extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the viroid is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the significance of that
is, but it at least tells you how stable
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can make its way through a CO2
extraction protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the viroid does move into male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you induce male flowering in cannabis
plants, you will see the presence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bands not just in the male flowers,
but also in the anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does move into male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also present in the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the presence of the viroid in
pollen grains in anthers as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual pollen itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if it's there, it's going
to be in the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also present in both hemp seed as
well as cannabis seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a 256 band, a very high frequency
of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transmission into seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do see an impact of the viroid on
seed development, which again is not
[SPEAKER_00]: surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are seeds from an infected plant,
seeds from a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to germinate and grow as
well as you would in the healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is devastating in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had some samples of thrips that
were feeding on an infected plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we crushed up the thrips and did
an RNA extraction, it's present in thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe thrips are transmitting hoplite
and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We germinated some of these infected
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to show you that as the seeds
start to germinate, the viroid is present
[SPEAKER_00]: on the seed coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first place we find it actually is
in the leaves, in the cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the leaves develop, when the leaves
are fully formed, it then moves down into
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't see it early on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see it move down from a
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do see seed transmission as a
result of infected seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the experiments we
have underway looking at host range.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the various plants we're looking
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we did the inoculations was
simply make a cutting or remove a leaf on
[SPEAKER_00]: a tobacco plant or a tomato plant and add
the sap to these injured tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, you do see the presence of
hoplite and viroid in tobacco leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is after three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in tobacco roots, after 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves a lot slower in these plants than
it does in cannabis, where you see
[SPEAKER_00]: movement in about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly in tomato, it takes about
eight weeks before we actually see high
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of the viroid in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, experimentally,
the viroid can infect these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean from a practical
perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to put the word out there
that growers should freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And worry about alternative hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are under experimental inoculation
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, I'm just going to talk quickly
about factors that destabilize hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at a number of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperatures, UVC, various treatments of
various chemicals, as well as addition of
[SPEAKER_00]: various enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to go through this fairly
quickly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we tested infected roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: With various treatments, vercon,
xerotol, bleach, hypochlorous acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: At these concentrations, the viroid is
extremely stable in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cannot eradicate it from those
tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, going from 30 degrees all the
way to 70 centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 to 30 minute exposures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The viroid is still stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upper bands here, which are probably
the linear bands, are removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But notice, heat stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely heat stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at dried sap and leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Survival, up to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just lying down on the tabletop or in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we also looked at UVC treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't destroy this viroid with UVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you add enzymes such as
RNAases, you can remove the viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is RNAase A, which cleaves as an
endo, a nucleus enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can certainly eradicate hoplatin
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so finally, we wanted to develop a
methodology that would allow us to test
[SPEAKER_00]: various chemicals for destruction of
hoplatin viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just shows you we extracted sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected it in an Eppendorf tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Added particular chemicals that we wanted
to test to see if it destroyed the RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we ran a gel to see what the
effect would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results are presented in the
following slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are various treatments that we
looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virkon, bleach, RNAase, and various other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arrow points specifically to bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% bleach has a destructive effect on the
RNA itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's again, a whole series of these
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the infectious sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were the treatments that were added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where you see the absence of bands,
again, corresponds to bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% for two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% bleach for two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% for one minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the RNA is destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also looked at hypochlorous
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hypochlorous acid does destroy the
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that Virkon does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No effect on the RNA at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly the bleach and the
hypochlorous acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This viroid spreads extremely well through
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads to the plant, becomes systemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's present in female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's present in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's present in male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's present in seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes a huge reduction in THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very stable in dried leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stable in sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way we could destroy the RNA
was exposure to 10% bleach and 1,000 ppm
[SPEAKER_00]: hypochlorous acid for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So disinfection of tools are going to be
relying on these two particular chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do know that there are significant
genotypic differences in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: hop-latent viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that requires a little additional work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what levels of viroids
actually are needed to cause infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 1,000?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 10,000?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a million?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do the viroid levels correlate
with disease symptoms or latency?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, of course, what environmental
factors are required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to end here once again with
the acknowledgement of the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out of time, so I'm going to be
available during coffee break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or during lunch for any questions that
come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hope I haven't depressed you all
with this news.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a challenge, but we'll get to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
