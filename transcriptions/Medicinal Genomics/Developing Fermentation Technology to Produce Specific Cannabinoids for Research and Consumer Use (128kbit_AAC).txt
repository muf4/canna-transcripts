[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here from Demetrix today to tell
you about how we are unlocking access to
[SPEAKER_00]: rare cannabinoids using scalable
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our mission at Demetrix is to make
nature's rarest ingredients accessible,
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable, and affordable for happier,
healthier lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focus on natural products because they
have huge impacts and huge challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got three of my favorite
plants on this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left, we have Artemisia annua,
and that's the plant also known as sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: wormwood, from which the anti-malarial
drug artemisinin is derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So artemisinin is the drug that's
recommended by the World Health
[SPEAKER_00]: Organization for treatment of malaria in
the developing world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very important drug,
and we need a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a drug that has suffered
from huge price volatility, so swings of
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as tenfold in pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that occurs because of boom bust
cycles in agriculture, because of bad
[SPEAKER_00]: weather, because of stockpiling and
speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few years ago, a second source of the
drug came online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a semi-synthetic form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what happens is that
scientists engineered some yeast with the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes to make a precursor of artemisinin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that precursor can be converted
by human chemists into artemisinin with a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of more chemical steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that's done really is put a
ceiling on price swings for the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's leveled out pricing considerably
and made the situation more manageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second example that I wanted to
bring up is Taxus brevifolia, or the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific yew tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was our source of the drug Taxol,
which is an important cancer drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pacific yew is also an endangered
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can imagine that that was not
going to cut it for supplying a cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, several semi-synthetic
methods of producing Taxol have been
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has led to the ability to supply
this drug to the world, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the last example I'm going
to talk about is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with the approval of Epidiolex
recently, that's a botanical extract from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, so a highly pure preparation of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the excitement about how
many other cannabinoids that are even
[SPEAKER_00]: rarer, I would propose that there could be
a scaling challenge ahead of us for many
[SPEAKER_00]: of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also propose that,
again, the solution could be production
[SPEAKER_00]: via fermentation, maybe with some
semi-synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today's market for natural ingredients
across the board is putting considerable
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure on traditional harvesting
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers are demanding effective and rare
natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are global consumers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brands are requiring a stable supply of
high quality and high purity ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet that demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the pharmaceutical side, botanical
drugs are extremely difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture and scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very few of them, actually,
that have been approved by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we think across the board that
agriculture is going to struggle to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing demand for these types of very
rare natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone here would also agree
that cannabinoids offer a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: untapped opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a chart from Actual Capital
forecasting legal cannabis sales in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States through the year 2030,
as well as the number of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're making the assumption that
by 2027, cannabis will be legal federally
[SPEAKER_00]: in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, no one knows that when or
if it will be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that taken together,
looking at kind of loosening regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: structures in the US and abroad in the
last few years, there's reason to be
[SPEAKER_00]: optimistic that we could really have 60
million consumers of cannabinoids in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US by the year 2030.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if that's the case, the question
that occurs to me is, which cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: will they be and where will we be getting
them from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So our understanding of cannabis is
growing beyond THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've heard in several talks before
today, there's more than 100 different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that have been at least
identified or structurally characterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just know very little about them on
the whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say one of the reasons we know
so little about the majority of these is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the majority of cannabinoids are
virtually inaccessible in the plant due to
[SPEAKER_00]: their scarcity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't the case for the common
cannabinoids like THC or CBD, which make
[SPEAKER_00]: up anywhere from, let's say, 10% to 30% of
the dry weight of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really drops off quickly after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start talking about the variants
like THCV or CBDV or CBG, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor to these other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are more like 1% of the dry
weight in the flower of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's putting you closer to $100 per
gram costs to isolate and purify these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, you get into the rare
cannabinoids, which are 0.01% to 1% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's $100 to $10,000 per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that group includes CBC, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, you get into these very rare
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are probably structures you haven't
seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are less than 0.01% of the flower
dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that they would cost,
if anyone was doing it, greater than
[SPEAKER_00]: $10,000 per gram to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really this challenge that
motivated our founder, Jay Keasling,
[SPEAKER_00]: to establish Demetrix in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little background on Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a busy guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a professor of chemical engineering
and bioengineering at UC Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also the associate lab director for
biosciences at Lawrence Berkeley National
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's the CEO of the Joint Bioenergy
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's generally regarded as an authority in
metabolic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's founded multiple companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So down there, you can see LS9,
LIGOS, and then Amaris, which is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: the company that developed that
artemisinin technology I was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier out of an invention that came out
of his lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really a breakthrough discovery
that Jay made with his lab that provided
[SPEAKER_00]: Demetrix with a real head start in this
microbial production field.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we've raised over $60
million in funding and seed in Series A
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the strength of Jay's reputation,
the team that he's been able to put
[SPEAKER_00]: together, and the progress we've made in
the last two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our major investors are Tuatara Capital
and Horizons Ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start talking a little bit
about what the plant does to make
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, because everything we do is
inspired by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a very interesting pathway in
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting means hard when it comes to
metabolic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting over here is a metabolic
pathway that kind of shows how the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pushes chemicals to make the final
cannabinoids down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the top, you have hexanoic acid
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through a series of conversion steps
and incorporation of other cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites, you get down to this
molecule, alivatolic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alivatolic acid can be joined together
with a second molecule called gerinal
[SPEAKER_00]: diphosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or GPP to make CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, of course, is kind of the mother
cannabinoid, the one which all the others
[SPEAKER_00]: are made off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the enzyme that does that is called an
aromatic parental transferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk about that a little
more later, so keep that one in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have CBGA, that can be converted
into delta 9 THCA or CBDA through the
[SPEAKER_00]: action of these cannabinoid synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THCA synthase or CBDA synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other synthases as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard about some of them today,
many probably uncharacterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the A here, of course,
means acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can be decarboxylated by heat,
for example, into THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what makes this pathway unusual and
more challenging for us is that it occurs
[SPEAKER_00]: in two phases in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first phase, GPP and alivatolic
acid are made inside the cell and joined
[SPEAKER_00]: together to make that CBGA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CBGA and the synthases are then
secreted into an extracellular kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: layer of lumen, a chamber called the
trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that last reaction to make THCA or
CBDA is occurring outside of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a weird observation now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's occurred to us that about 1,000
cannabinoid-producing yeast cells could
[SPEAKER_00]: fit into a single trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if instead of doing that,
we were to fill up a large fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: vessel with those yeast cells,
we'd essentially have a gigantic trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the point of all this,
is that fermentation in demetrics has the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages of a specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about a plant,
a plant is an amazing organism,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it does a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes thousands of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the cannabis plant, in a very small
part of the total biomass, it also
[SPEAKER_00]: produces these trichome structures and
makes the cannabinoids that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that it's actually
inefficient for some of these rarer
[SPEAKER_00]: natural products, because it's doing so
many other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it requires a lot of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have limited control, even with some
very heroic breeding, over the final
[SPEAKER_00]: products it makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, you have a lot of waste,
and the process overall isn't very agile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by contrast, fermentation is really
a specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a streamlined and highly
efficient approach, requiring fewer
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, complete control, and creating
little waste and working quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get into this in a little
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, as a specialist, we take
nature's unpredictability out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process that I'm describing today
is consistent and pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's resource light and reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It scales easily and quickly, as the
market does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it yields ingredients in weeks instead
of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were to follow the production of
some purified cannabinoids through via
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture or fermentation, that
comparison would look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to make a lot of purified
cannabinoid via agriculture, you'd start
[SPEAKER_00]: by growing a lot of wet plant,
say 100,000 kilograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be probably three to
four months at minimum to get your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You then dry down the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're at 30,000 kilos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You trim away to get just the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're down to 10,000 kilos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do some pretty intense
purifications to separate these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids from all the other products
in the plant, from the waxes, the other
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals, the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, if you had a high THC
strain, you might have 2,000 kilos of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a strain that specialized in
making CBD, maybe you're at 1,200 kilos of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going after one of the rarer
ones, like the varine, CBDV, you'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: only 250 kilos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going after one of these
really rare compounds I was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, I'll call it CBDX, you'd have as
little as one kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really a best case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be variable, dependent on
weather, geography, and, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural abundance of the compound you
pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to take the fermentation
route, you would inoculate a large
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation tank with the
cannabinoid-producing yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would fill up the tank by growing
over the course of one to two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that would be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fermentation would be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at that point, you would do a
purification process, which would be much
[SPEAKER_00]: more straightforward than purifying from
plant tissue, because now you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: separating from yeast cells and from the
media in the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would end up with 2,000 kilograms
of either THC or CBD or CBDV or the CBDX
[SPEAKER_00]: rare compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because the fermentation
process is not dependent on the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance of the compound in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We choose the strain that we grow,
and it makes the product that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: engineered to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not happening outdoors in a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's independent of weather, geography,
and, as I mentioned, the abundance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to get into a little more
detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try not to get too hardcore,
because it's the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Demetrix process to produce,
I'll call them common cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA and CBDA from engineered yeast looks
something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start by engineering a yeast cell
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's baker's yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what brings us beer, wine,
bread, pretty well-known organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then basically need to bring in all the
parts to make cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to think of it like an
assembly line, where each gene we bring
[SPEAKER_00]: in, each piece of genetic engineering we
do, is a unit operation in this assembly
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we source those unit operations
from whatever organism has the best
[SPEAKER_00]: version, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the genes in our yeast come
from cannabis, but some of them come from
[SPEAKER_00]: other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, we have this engineered
yeast cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to feed it sugar,
and we're going to feed it hexanoic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the yeast cell takes the sugar and
converts it into gerinal diphosphate,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that GPP molecule, and another
molecule called malonyl CoA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In combination with the hexanoic acid we
feed in, the cells can make that
[SPEAKER_00]: olivatolic acid molecule I talked about,
and then finally make the CBGA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, if the strain has a CBDA
synthase, we make CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has a THCA synthase, instead,
we're going to make THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are common cannabinoids,
but they're obviously valuable products
[SPEAKER_00]: that do important things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go into APIs, which are
pharmaceutical precursors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go into consumer products,
anything from skin creams to
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's the recreational
market with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think where it gets really
interesting, though, for this conference,
[SPEAKER_00]: is when we replace this hexanoic acid with
different carboxylic acids and start to
[SPEAKER_00]: get access to rare and new-to-nature
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for example, if we were to take
that same setup and feed butyric acid
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of hexanoic acid, now we'd be
making varins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd make CBGVA, which is the varin
form of CBG, and we'd make CBDVA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the varin form of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically a carboxylic acid with
a shorter chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also go to a longer chain,
like octanoic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that case, we'd be making these
compounds that have C7 tails, both the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGA and the CBDA version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, if I had a THCA synthase
here, we'd be making the THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA versions of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing we could do is we could go
to the Sigma catalog, and we could select
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 carboxylic acids that look roughly like
hexanoic acid, but obviously are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse there, and then just test them in
our strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that the majority of them end
up getting incorporated into the final
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little blue stubs there represent
any of these functionalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now these are not natural compounds
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're calling them new-to-nature
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, these are very interesting
for new drug development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine, given the number of
carboxylic acids that are available,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could make quite a few compounds
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to zoom back and just kind of
summarize the advantages of this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we have an agile platform for
the economical production of rare
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, rare and novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have two dials that we can turn
on this platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is the strain, the yeast strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, we could choose a strain
that makes CBD here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we fill up the fermenter with those
yeast cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we choose the feed, the
carboxylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it was standard, we'd be feeding
hexanoic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, we're going to make CBD,
which is the natural form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's chemically identical and
indistinguishable from what the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we were to switch to a THC
strain over here and then instead feed a
[SPEAKER_00]: rare carboxylic acid, so that deuteric
acid example I was telling you about,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we'd be making the varine form at the
same efficiency that we make the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the more common molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting to where we could do this,
there were some challenges along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go through the kind of
big three challenges we faced and at a
[SPEAKER_00]: very high level how we've solved them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first challenge was really
de-bottlenecking CBGA production in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so CBGA, remember, is what you get
when you combine that olivatolic acid and
[SPEAKER_00]: GPP molecule with an enzyme called an
aromatic parental transferase to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we first started out using the
enzyme described in the literature,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were not making a lot of CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was put in the enzyme that
the Keasling lab had identified called
[SPEAKER_00]: CSPT4 and immediately saw massive
improvement in production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So greater than 10,000-fold improvement in
production of CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is pretty important because no
CBGA, no downstream cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to spend a little more time on
that enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the original characterized enzyme
was called CSPT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was discovered by Jonathan Page's
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a relative of CSPT4, but actually
fairly different, only about 65%
[SPEAKER_00]: identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CSPT1, I would say cruelly makes,
well, for the microbial engineer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak to the plant, but for the
microbial engineer, it's a cruel enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: because it makes just enough CBGA in yeast
that you might think, hey, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: right enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just we've got to adapt it to the
yeast cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to tweak it to get it into the
yeast cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess no amount of tweaking has
really worked well there because groups
[SPEAKER_00]: have moved on and found another
alternative, NPHB.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another aromatic parental
transferase from streptomyces bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one makes, well, the wild type
version of the enzyme, the natural version
[SPEAKER_00]: of the enzyme makes mostly the wrong
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do some clever mutagenesis on
it, which has been done, you can make a
[SPEAKER_00]: modest amount of CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we get to CSPT4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the enzyme that the Kiesling
lab developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put that into yeast,
you can just make, I would just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: massive amounts of CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's pretty clear to me,
at least from the microbial work,
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is the enzyme that is meant to
do that step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to use an engine analogy here,
CSPT1 is maybe a compact car engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: NPHB could be a truck engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: CSPT4 is more like a jet engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found ourselves in early 2018 in the
position of having strains that made a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we ran into our second
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was that the cannabinoid
synthase enzymes just don't work well in
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so remember, we're making CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got past that hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we want to convert that into CBDA
here with one of the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're trying to use CBDA
synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it basically totally failed at
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like barely detectable production,
micrograms per nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, we took kind of a
two-pronged approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we re-engineered the synthase enzyme
itself to try to make it more amenable to
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also attacked from the other
end and re-engineered the yeast cells to
[SPEAKER_00]: make them support the function of this
enzyme better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that actually was quite a few
steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this was the synthase
optimization early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were a series of
engineering features that we stacked to
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the point where we were essentially
converting all of the CBGA our strains was
[SPEAKER_00]: making.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the third challenge is scale-up in
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, 2019 has been all about
getting those strains into fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, tanks that mimic what they
would be in at full-scale production and
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure that we have processes and
strains in place that are stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sounds less interesting and maybe
less hard than the first two challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for folks that have been in the
industrial synth bio area, they know that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is actually quite challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good news is that we have several
folks on our team who have experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's over nearly 10 molecules
that have been scaled to multi-ton amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: in production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that experience is in our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we take this challenge seriously,
but we're also confident we can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in total, I've really told you about
how we've de-bottled that and how we've
[SPEAKER_00]: managed to protect microbial cannabinoid
production in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that means is we have a
platform where we can produce the common
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can also produce rare and
new-to-nature cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using our funding right now to go
further faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's kind of three parts to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, we're up to nearly 35
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a team of experts in R&D,
in manufacturing, commercialization,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in regulatory, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also invested in building a
best-in-class lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd characterize it as a lab that's
efficiently focused on production of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains to make high-value natural
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are a lot of automation
computing tools that are a part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: lab that make the work go faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so essentially, our scientists spend a
lot less time pipetting, and they can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of do higher-value activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last piece that I think is pretty
important, too, is that we're developing
[SPEAKER_00]: industry-leading intellectual property
around this microbial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've invested in IP licenses,
for example, the license of the work from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kiesling lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over the last couple of years,
we've also developed our own suite of
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property that is propelling
our technology forward and enabling
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I wanted to return to our
mission statement, which is to make
[SPEAKER_00]: nature's rarest ingredients accessible,
sustainable, and affordable for happier,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, everything that I've been
talking about in the last 20 minutes has
[SPEAKER_00]: been about the first part, the
accessibility part, the ability to scale
[SPEAKER_00]: these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's great about being at this
conference is getting a chance to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: second part, which is finding out what
these compounds are good for and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: can really impact human health in
meaningful ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, thanks for your
attention and happy to take some
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is absolutely fascinating work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love seeing the adjustments on the
primal transferases.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get a gauge of the relative
efficiencies next to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, you're using sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 99% of the sugar in the world is made
by the Calvin cycle in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so why rip out the middleman there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And are you getting close to the
efficiencies and the carbon audits that
[SPEAKER_03]: make this type of activity economically
feasible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't want to knock the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it didn't come off like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's mostly that the cannabis
plant has a number of responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't get into specific numbers on
where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say the cannabis plant is
doing all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If its sole job was to convert the
sunlight into cannabinoids, it would kick
[SPEAKER_00]: our ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is doing all sorts of things as a
plant needs to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that really what we do is
we take a single slice of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism that plant is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it into yeast, feed them sugar,
just run them at full speed, and get the
[SPEAKER_00]: process done in one to two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's where the
competitiveness comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you comment on the regulatory
structure, which licenses you need,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then which labeling would go on the
products using those ingredients?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulatory is something we understand is
definitely very important and a major
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am not qualified to tell you the
answer to that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely something we've made
central to our early development effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not waiting until we have the
product to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a DEA license, because it's not a
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're DEA licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything we do is within federal law,
and it'll always be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that situation is kind of
changing rapidly, and it's ill-defined
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we err on the side of caution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the great talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that you're in the scale-up
phase with scaling up the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: product that you're making.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen in literature in the past that
there's issues with cytotoxicity with some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cannabinoids that are produced,
at least the terminal cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you've addressed yet in
scalability, or have seen one way or the
[SPEAKER_01]: other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting in metabolic
engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard this for a number of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some cases where the
products are truly toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other cases, it just has to do with
misbalancing the metabolic pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can't get into detail,
but I'd say we think it's the latter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not overly concerned about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're concerned about the toxicity of
these compounds to yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have one more question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the yield of the product you're
making?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't tell you that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us any sense of when this
technology might come online and be a
[SPEAKER_02]: competitive threat to the traditional art
of growing marijuana and cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think first, this is going to be a
massive ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that what I described
here today is ever going to be a threat to
[SPEAKER_00]: a large number of people that want to
interact directly with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we could be a threat to rare
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't view it as a threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I view it more as a bonus, because there
just isn't a good way to scale those right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more on the science side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly how much I'm allowed
to say about our scale-up timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's what we're working on right now,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just one other question.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of relatively quickly,
for rare cannabinoids, are we talking 12
[SPEAKER_02]: months?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking five years, seven years
type of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any type of time frame?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely less than five years,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know, or is it known, what it is
about cannabinoids that are toxic to
[SPEAKER_05]: yeast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I actually don't think they're
that toxic to yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have seen those reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's a hard question to
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess you could add them
exogenously to a yeast culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe see toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not very soluble compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's questions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that producing cannabinoids can be
toxic, perhaps, even if the final.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just fall back on kind of a
variation on my last answer, which is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to get everything lined up right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to that assembly line analogy,
I think of the I Love Lucy part,
[SPEAKER_00]: where she's on the conveyor belt with the
chocolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're basically coming in too fast
and starting to spill over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in metabolic engineering, when you end
up in that situation, that spillover,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of being chocolate, is usually
toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that kind of thing, where you just
basically need to get things balanced
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if somebody had three cannabinoids and
they wanted to go into the FDA with a plan
[SPEAKER_04]: and we wanted to start a master drug file,
how soon could you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it depends on which cannabinoids
they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that our technology is
particularly amenable to certain kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we should have access to,
in principle, the full range of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd say I basically would need to see
the compounds to give an estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some, it could be very quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
