[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the opportunity to talk to
doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and patients are the people who are
going to bring us to freedom and better
[SPEAKER_01]: health, and I appreciate your attendance
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to talk to you about how to
legally recommend cannabis to your
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, which is certainly more about
protecting your license than protecting
[SPEAKER_01]: your patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis has quite a range of safety,
and the licensing issues are more
[SPEAKER_01]: political than about the care of your
clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to talk about the scope of my
talk is going to be about talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis practice in two contexts.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, in terms of the federal regulation
of the controlled substances licenses that
[SPEAKER_01]: many of you have, and secondly,
in terms of state physician and health
[SPEAKER_01]: care provider licensing boards,
the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be in Massachusetts,
the Board of Registration of Medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Board of Registration in Nursing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a footnote on that, nurse
practitioners have had certifying
[SPEAKER_01]: authority since 2014 as a matter of state
law and as a matter of the nursing board
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Department of Public Health,
which is tasked with overseeing the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis law in Massachusetts,
has failed to accommodate that in their
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are regulations pending to do that,
and my latest information is that perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: in June they will become final so that
nurse practitioners can be included as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me talk about the feds hopefully
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that cannabis is a schedule
one designation with no medical use,
[SPEAKER_01]: so therefore there is no prescription
authority for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is in spite of the fact that the
Department of Health and Human Services of
[SPEAKER_01]: the federal government has had a patent
since 2003 for medical cannabis'
[SPEAKER_01]: antioxidant effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also in spite of several lawsuits
that have documented the medical benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis and that the federal courts
have allowed to have refused to get
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in the rescheduling process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So state medical marijuana laws have been
the workaround.
[SPEAKER_01]: West Virginia is about to become the 29th
state, but the first state was California
[SPEAKER_01]: in 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to get back, to enable doctors and
patients to get access to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: state medical cannabis laws authorize
physicians and health care providers to
[SPEAKER_01]: certify or recommend patient access,
and this is bypassing the prescription
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a certifying doctor, unlike a
prescribing doctor, simply finds that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, finds that the patient has an
eligible condition, finds that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: can relieve that condition, determines
that the benefits outweigh the risks,
[SPEAKER_01]: and discloses to the patient the
risk-benefit analysis and access to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is a matter of access,
and not dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My colleague Val Romano is going to talk a
little bit more about the Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, but again, getting back to
the federal context for your work,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that you have a belt and
suspender protection from federal
[SPEAKER_01]: interference with what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The belt is what I would call the Conant
v.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walters decision, a 2000 trial court
decision that was affirmed in 2002 by an
[SPEAKER_01]: appellate court in which the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supreme Court denied certiorari,
so it remains the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And under that decision, there is a
permanent injunction against federal law
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement officers and the Department of
Justice and administrative agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are enjoined, and I hate to read
this, from either revoking a physician's
[SPEAKER_01]: license to prescribe controlled substances
or conducting an investigation of a
[SPEAKER_01]: physician solely for a physician's
professional recommendation for the use of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a permanent injunction that
protects your licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The suspenders for federal protection from
interference with your practice is the
[SPEAKER_01]: 2006 right to die case, the Gonzalez v.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon decision of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the second Bush administration's
reaction to Oregon's right to die law,
[SPEAKER_01]: and again, it is easier for me to read
from the decision so you can understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the scope of the protection that you have
from federal interference.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from the Gonzalez decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congressional regulation of medical
practice, insofar as it bars doctors from
[SPEAKER_01]: using their prescription writing powers as
a means to engage in illicit drug dealing,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is the extent of federal regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that bar, however, the Controlled
Substances Act manifests no intent to
[SPEAKER_01]: regulate the practice of medicine
generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Controlled Substances Act's
prescription requirement does not
[SPEAKER_01]: authorize the Attorney General to bar
physicians from dispensing controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: substances for assisted suicide in the
face of a state medical regime that
[SPEAKER_01]: permits such conduct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is your belt and suspenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what anybody else tells you,
as long as you are practicing within the
[SPEAKER_01]: confines of a state law, state law
permitting that type of medical practice,
[SPEAKER_01]: that type of medical treatment,
you are essentially immune from federal
[SPEAKER_01]: interference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me talk now about state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Massachusetts, as I mentioned,
you've got the Board of Registration of
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicine and Nursing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got, from the state medical
licensing board, no specific cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine practice guidances.
[SPEAKER_01]: You simply have the state medical
marijuana law, and again, Val is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: speak to you more on that, and you have
the Department of Public Health
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations implementing that law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while those regulations pretty much
parrot the state law, there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: continuing medical education requirement
that's in there as well, and I will refer
[SPEAKER_01]: you to the access to these online and to
Val's presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the state level, with regard to
criminal protections, doctors are immune
[SPEAKER_01]: from criminal prosecution as a matter of a
state statute for authorizing controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: substances use for a legitimate medical
purpose in the course of professional
[SPEAKER_01]: practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no criminal risk there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have protection under Massachusetts
tort law, negligence law, that no
[SPEAKER_01]: healthcare provider will be liable to a
third party for a patient's negligence or
[SPEAKER_01]: abuse of the medicine if the risks of
impairment are disclosed by the healthcare
[SPEAKER_01]: provider and documented with additional
documentation of the patient's competency
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand that warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the warning's documented and the
patient's competency, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: have the patient repeat back to you what
they understand to be the warnings,
[SPEAKER_01]: then that's all documented in the chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your defense to a negligence
action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really very little malpractice
risk because these recommendations and
[SPEAKER_01]: certifications are not dosing
instructions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're simply access with the patient
able to self-titrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your tort risk is similarly minimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way to protect your license is
documentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggest a written examination,
assessment, and patient disclosure
[SPEAKER_01]: protocol, something that notes,
that provides you a outline of a series of
[SPEAKER_01]: check boxes to go through as you do your
examinations and your assessments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this protocol can be used to do the
tasks that will protect you and then
[SPEAKER_01]: document them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The results of each one of those tasks in
your record.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first part of safe cannabis practice,
cannabis medicine practice, is a full
[SPEAKER_01]: patient medical record review.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that, this is particularly focused
on the condition or symptom that's being
[SPEAKER_01]: to be treated with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And particularly important is a condition
diagnosis in the medical record by a
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist for that symptom, for that
condition, particularly so if it's beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: your specialty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can piggyback on another specialist's
diagnosis, but if a patient is coming into
[SPEAKER_01]: you for the first time with a condition
that a specialist hasn't identified and
[SPEAKER_01]: you want a specialist in that condition,
don't certify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Refer the patient to a specialist,
and then you can piggyback on the
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist's diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in person, the next important part of
the documentation is an in-person clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: examination especially regarding the
condition or symptom to be treated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should also be looking for the
patient's pre-certification use of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana as providing evidence for you
that there may be some efficacy in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for that patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing to do in the chart is to
perform a literature review of the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits and risks of medical cannabis for
the symptom to be treated and for the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient's other pre-examination.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simply practicing safe medicine and
filling your file with material in case
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a review.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next part is doing the certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: The certification is an assessment of
risks and benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the chart should include a discussion,
a listing of those, your analysis as to
[SPEAKER_01]: why you believe that the benefits outweigh
the risks, and a disclosure to the patient
[SPEAKER_01]: of that risk-benefit analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, there should be something in the
nature of a treatment plan, as you would
[SPEAKER_01]: with any other patient that comes with
you, that would include some metrics for
[SPEAKER_01]: assessing the value of the cannabis
treatment, whether it be symptom relief,
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of life improvement, or even harm
reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ways to assist you on that and
involve the patient in that process is to
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend strongly to a patient that the
patient keep a diary of benefits and side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is part of keeping your continuing
relationship with the patient and giving
[SPEAKER_01]: you the ability to monitor how things are
going with the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also should include trying to
schedule, you can't compel the patients to
[SPEAKER_01]: come back, but in terms of the ongoing
role in the patient's treatment,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is part of the requirement under
Massachusetts law, scheduling at minimum a
[SPEAKER_01]: two-week follow-up to see how the
experience with the cannabis medicine is
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can put that feedback into the
chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as a follow-up appointment three
to six months out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't compel the patients to come in,
but you can put those recommendations in
[SPEAKER_01]: your paperwork and have that on hand in
case someone comes, one of the licensing
[SPEAKER_01]: board comes to look at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important way to protect
yourself, besides this documentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: is essentially also not to have contact
with the medicine, not to touch the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a doctor, when the patient asks you
about supply, in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can simply refer them to the
licensing, to the DPH licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution network.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are only 10 in Massachusetts so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many more in the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, the point about why licensing
boards are looking at people is simply a
[SPEAKER_01]: matter of politics and a matter of the
suppression of doctor participation in
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the chief culprits for this is the
Mass Medical Society, which has been
[SPEAKER_01]: against cannabis medicine ever since the
campaign for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that there are only a few doctors who
are participating in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're providing, I mean, 20% of the
doctors are providing 80% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those people get targeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who choose in
Massachusetts to join this brigade of
[SPEAKER_01]: courageous doctors, what I've told you is
hopefully gonna help you if they come
[SPEAKER_01]: after you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got the documentation,
you are immune.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that doctors, at least one
doctor who has been challenged by the
[SPEAKER_01]: board has had the board's recommendation
for suspension dismissed by an
[SPEAKER_01]: administrative law judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crime there was not anything to do
with patient complaints and everything to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with the doctor's use of nurse
practitioners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, the nurse practitioner
regulation has been published.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already permitted under the nursing
regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be permitted under the DPH regs
hopefully around June sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I have for the content of
my talk, but we're trying to keep our
[SPEAKER_01]: talks short so that we can give plenty of
time for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mic should work over there if you
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, does your mic work over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, can everyone hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Valerio Romano.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an attorney with a VGR law firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We represent about a third of the
dispensary applicants and registration
[SPEAKER_02]: holders or registration holders throughout
the Commonwealth work closely with this
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also an attorney in California,
although I live here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing something to do with
medical marijuana for probably 20 years
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was great when Massachusetts passed
our law in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say, first of all, thank you for
participating in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it wasn't for courageous doctors in
evaluation centers really stepping up,
[SPEAKER_02]: we wouldn't have a medical marijuana
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wouldn't have any incentive for
dispensaries to try to open up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wouldn't have enough patient access to
actually collect any data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wouldn't be moving things forward at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Partners, for instance, is actually doing
a study of medical marijuana patients over
[SPEAKER_02]: the next few months, collecting data.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wouldn't be enough patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, you can look on the Department
of Public Health website, and every month
[SPEAKER_02]: they actually put up a dashboard to show
you what the status of the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana program in Massachusetts is for
that month.
[SPEAKER_02]: As of March 31st, there were 40,411
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of those certifications were written
by just a handful of doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though there are, in fact,
189 doctors who have registered to certify
[SPEAKER_02]: patients in the Commonwealth, with about
six more added in March, it's very few of
[SPEAKER_02]: them that are actually doing the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mike Cutler touched on Dr. Naldame,
who got in a little hot water for working
[SPEAKER_02]: with nurse practitioners, and fortunately
has been vindicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, nurse practitioners were
authorized under the law and the regs from
[SPEAKER_02]: their inception.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was merely because there wasn't a
process for allowing nurses to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: that it became a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The supervision that was going on at
CannaCare was called into question,
[SPEAKER_02]: although ultimately turned out to be
vindicated, and they were doing the right
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sources of information for you to
sort of get to kind of the nuts and bolts,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'd invite anyone to chime in as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sources of information, you have the
regs for the medical use of marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: program, 105 CMR 725.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have 243 CMR 1, 2, and 3 that are
specifically enumerated in the regs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Conant v.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walters, which Mike spoke about,
which really created a First Amendment
[SPEAKER_02]: privilege for you to discuss treatment
options with your patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beauty of that case.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the Controlled Substances Act,
Title 21 of the United States Code.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the Act for the Humanitarian
Medical Use of Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's essentially the law that the voters
passed in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: 63% of people in the Commonwealth agreed
on something, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rarely happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have Extensive Board of
Registration Policies, and then the DPH
[SPEAKER_02]: Guidance for Physicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually lay it out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They lay out, there's some documents on
the DPH website where they lay out what
[SPEAKER_02]: you can do, what you can't do,
and they actually lay out the process for
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming a Certifying Physician.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, Certifying Physician must be
a Mass License Physician.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to hold an active, full license
with no prescribing restrictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to have a Massachusetts
Controlled Substance Registration.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to have at least one established
place of practice in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to complete a minimum of two
hours of Category 1 Continuing
[SPEAKER_02]: Professional Development Credits that CME
has to explain the proper use of
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, including side effects,
dosage, and contraindications,
[SPEAKER_02]: including with psychotropic drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have to register with the Medical
Use of Marijuana program via their
[SPEAKER_02]: website.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have to have this bonafide
doctor-patient relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Mass Medical Society chimed in a
lot, and so the voters passed a five-page
[SPEAKER_02]: law in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2013, the Department of Public Health
went around the Commonwealth and had
[SPEAKER_02]: listening sessions for how we were going
to implement this five-page law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people chimed in,
and there was a lot of insightful
[SPEAKER_02]: information that was put forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the groups that chimed in was
the Mass Medical Society, who I'm sure you
[SPEAKER_02]: all know better than I do, 25,000 doctors
and med students.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really wanted to make sure that
people had this, what a bonafide
[SPEAKER_02]: doctor-patient relationship would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unlike California, where you can get a
certification or a recommendation over
[SPEAKER_02]: Skype, doctors never even reviewed your
medical history.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't know you at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have an ongoing role.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just give them their couple hundred
bucks, and you're getting your privilege
[SPEAKER_02]: to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, the Mass Medical Society wants you
to have conducted the clinical visit,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Mike said, completed and documented
the full assessment of the patient's
[SPEAKER_02]: medical history, explained the benefits
and harms, and has a role in the ongoing
[SPEAKER_02]: care and treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're really trying to make it so you
have to have that role, that relationship
[SPEAKER_02]: with the doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're supposed to use the
prescription monitoring program,
[SPEAKER_02]: or MassPAT now, before issuing that
written certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it sounds like a lot of overhead,
and a lot of doctors aren't engaging in
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's because of these evaluation
centers, like I said early on,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm thankful that they're actually
allowing patients who otherwise,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're primary care doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sort of a cynic, and I get sort of
enthusiastic about these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cannabis, although we call cannabis
big business, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis business does not have a pretty
30-something-year-old pharmaceutical rep
[SPEAKER_02]: coming into your office offering free
samples and to take you out to lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably should, but we don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why cannabis is not actually
probably accepted as well as it could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another reason is Rach V.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gonzalez, which is a case out of the Ninth
Circuit, or actually the United States
[SPEAKER_02]: Supreme Court, ultimately, which held that
the purely intrastate production and use
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis actually violates interstate
commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why does Congress have the authority to
regulate cannabis use if it's a purely
[SPEAKER_02]: intrastate activity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of this principle, and your
doctors, not lawyers, but this Wicard
[SPEAKER_02]: principle, which started, somebody was
growing wheat at home, and they said it's
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal for you to grow wheat at home
because ultimately you're hurting the
[SPEAKER_02]: interstate commerce for wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm a medical marijuana patient,
and big pharma has completely failed me,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm growing cannabis at home,
and I got a few plants, and it's helping
[SPEAKER_02]: me, what interstate commerce am I actually
harming?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so it's again why we need
pharmaceutical reps so that we can see the
[SPEAKER_02]: interstate commerce that we're harming is
the prescription of other pills and other
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, there was a great study,
there was a great study last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's actually been replicated and
further analyzed, but what it said in
[SPEAKER_02]: medical marijuana states, 1,826 fewer pain
pills prescribed per year per doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1,826 per doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: 562 fewer doses of anxiety pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: 541 fewer doses of nausea medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we look at, you know,
we're in Massachusetts, we know we have
[SPEAKER_02]: this horrible problem with opiates.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at what's going on in mass,
if a patient is never going down the road
[SPEAKER_02]: of vikes and perks and oxys and becoming a
heroin addict and then having their
[SPEAKER_02]: insurance run out, and I know I'm stating
the obvious to you, but it's something
[SPEAKER_02]: that is worth being repeated.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you never go down that road,
then that's why we have 1,800.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1,800 fewer pain pills prescribed in
medical marijuana jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the Journal of the American
Medical Association came out a few years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago and said 24.8% less opiate mortalities
in marijuana jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: A full 25 out of 100 fewer people dying in
marijuana jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the data is overwhelming,
and don't let anybody tell you otherwise,
[SPEAKER_02]: because to find real impartial data,
like peer-reviewed studies out of major
[SPEAKER_02]: universities, the opponents don't have
that kind of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have purely objective, not objective,
you know, data with a particular focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the data's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to keep going, what else you need to
know as far as under the law, and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of my soapboxing, and I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a qualifying patient has to be a mass
resident.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to be 18 years or older.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if they're under 18, you have to have
two physicians review, see them,
[SPEAKER_02]: and say they have a life-limiting illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll finish up, and I'll pass it on,
and we can move to questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quickly, evaluation centers,
I just want to emphasize again the
[SPEAKER_02]: important role that they're playing,
but also the reason why there's only a few
[SPEAKER_02]: doctors certifying most of the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would love to have all of you get on
board this important treatment option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's collect data so that we don't have
that argument against cannabis anymore,
[SPEAKER_02]: and let's figure out a way that we can
really make it clear to the public as a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole, even the ones who are listening to
the pretty pharmaceutical rep,
[SPEAKER_02]: that this is a good thing for the
populace.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have only a few minutes,
so Bonnie's going to give us some
[SPEAKER_03]: experience from California as well,
and her experiences working with patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a few do's and don'ts,
and also some cases where doctors in
[SPEAKER_00]: California have been in trouble,
and they're pretty egregious, and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think anybody here is going to do this,
but remember, in California, it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild West for quite some time,
and a person could just walk in off the
[SPEAKER_00]: street, say, my back hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You collected their money, and you gave
them a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the doctors who are still standing
that are doing that kind of practice are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be out of business because it's
going to be legally available as of
[SPEAKER_00]: January 1st, and then the rest of us who
actually practice medicine just using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in our toolbox are going to be
the ones who still see patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat every patient and go through the
process the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: History, physical, review of medical
records, and I do highly recommend that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know the person and they are
coming to you specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're open to that and you're
going to help a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're open to that, ask them to fax or
scan their medical records ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it a lot easier if you know what
they have before they come, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: document the heck out of your chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I document medications that the patient
has tried that have not worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I document surgical procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I document how many physicians they've
seen sometimes, what major academic
[SPEAKER_00]: centers they've gone to for care,
for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is documentation that will help you
if something happens and be able to back
[SPEAKER_00]: up your decision-making.
[SPEAKER_00]: On every chart, I write patient if I
decide that they qualify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patient qualifies for medical cannabis
based on California law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually write the benefits, assessing if
the benefits outweigh the risk,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I also write that I've discussed side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my paperwork that I give to a patient,
a new intake form is seven pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two pages of medical information and
medications they've tried, but then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: five pages of informed consent and an
arbitration agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for almost a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not been in trouble with the
medical board, and I've not gotten sued.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Dr. Hergenmather is here in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been doing a lot longer than I have,
and I know he does it the right way,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, and has not gotten in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, documentation is your key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, at one point, was a medical director of
overseeing 15 different medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: offices about six or seven years ago,
and we had some doctors who did have
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, but documentation was what saved
them, and so that is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did those problems come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: In one case, it was a parent calling
saying, my son does not have what you said
[SPEAKER_00]: he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found his letter, and so you may get a
call from a family member.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we're not gonna break hip,
but we don't know who that person is on
[SPEAKER_00]: the phone, so we say, we can't help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't disclose anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point, there was a complaint to the
medical board, and that doctor did have
[SPEAKER_00]: the chart subpoenaed, but because that
doctor's medical records were sound,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the patient did bring in medical
records, his mother didn't know the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: story and did not know other medications
he was on, so that was easy, and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: dismissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple cases that were just egregious
and ridiculous is we had a famous case,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the doctor, who a patient
came in, and he said, can you just give me
[SPEAKER_00]: a blank page and a caregiver letter,
and the guy, it was an undercover person
[SPEAKER_00]: from the medical board, and they got a
blank caregiver letter where they could
[SPEAKER_00]: just put in somebody's name, and they made
this ridiculous assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, oh, we're gonna write the dog's
name in there or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just ridiculous, and the doctor got
dinged for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on probation for that, so that was
one case, and then very recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asked to write a letter for a
doctor, which I declined to do because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a local physician near me who is an
internal medicine specialist who saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: five-year-old who had no diagnosis,
but the family was saying, we don't want a
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis of ADD on the chart,
but the school's saying he has ADD,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you just give us a letter,
and he did, and it ended up that the
[SPEAKER_00]: school asked, well, what medicine is he
on, and they said he's on cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it went to Child Protective
Services and became a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents are thrilled with the
treatment, it's just that the doctor was
[SPEAKER_00]: not qualified to diagnose a five-year-old
with ADD, so going back to what Mike said
[SPEAKER_00]: here, if you're not qualified to make the
diagnosis, don't make sure they see a
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist, make sure they have paperwork,
and again, in my practice, anybody under
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, they don't even get an appointment
with me unless they send in medical
[SPEAKER_00]: records ahead of time, and if that takes
them four months, then so be it,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only so much you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and fortunately, I think we're able
to take questions after this just due to
[SPEAKER_03]: the incoming next panel that's up,
so we're a little short on the time here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a lunch collision,
unfortunately, but I do want to thank
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the advice you guys have given.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's incredibly important that we
get this correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having the legal understanding of the
realms of what we can do is paramount to
[SPEAKER_03]: making patients have safer access.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
