[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to the McKernans collectively and
especially Kevin for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed this event last year and it
looked really great and obviously when
[SPEAKER_00]: you...
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm mic'd up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it being turned on now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to repeat, thanks to the McKernans and
Kevin especially for organizing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really nice mix of, you know,
chemistry, biomedical science and what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about which is plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed my title a little bit because we
had a paper come out in the last week on
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and cannabis so I won't just talk
about cannabinoids and trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before that I thought I'd show this
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Richard Evans-Schultes who was a
professor at Harvard at the Botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: Museum, sort of just across the river
obviously from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of Richard
Evans-Schultes in 1972 in Kandahar in
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was investigating the differences
between the species of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis indica and sativa or what's
purportedly those differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really cool that there's a
pioneer of cannabis right here in Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed away in 2001 but was really the
father of the field of ethnobotany and
[SPEAKER_00]: really got a lot of people excited about
medicinal plants and psychoactive plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and hallucinogenic plants even though he
was extremely sort of conservative Harvard
[SPEAKER_00]: faculty member.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went down to the Amazon and used
ayahuasca and all this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1972 he quoted someone else to say,
the story of marijuana is not yet written
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think we're still seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still writing that story and
conferences like this are really moving
[SPEAKER_00]: things along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm interested in cannabis as a
medicinal plant and as others have said
[SPEAKER_00]: this morning, it's really a metabolic
factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a factory for compounds such as THC
and CBD, cannabigerol, other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's potentially 110 or over 100 of the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then terpenes like myrcine and
linalool and beta-cariophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together they form this mixture of
bioactive metabolites that really produce
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects of the plant that people get
when they consume it either orally or in
[SPEAKER_00]: inhaled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, those effects of course are
psychoactivity, pain relief, and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially useful medical properties we
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we look at that plant on a
chemical analysis, and the lab that I
[SPEAKER_00]: founded in Vancouver both does genomics as
I'll talk about in this talk, but we do a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of in-depth chemical profiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of maybe a typical and
analytical profile of a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabinoids such as CBD,
the acid form of CBD and THC, in this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant essentially, you know, a sort of
one-to-one ratio, so what would be called
[SPEAKER_00]: a chemotype two plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see like CBGA, cannabigerolic
acid and cannabichromatic acid also
[SPEAKER_00]: present in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, you know, there's kind of the,
although there's 105 cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: the major ones are what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically there's sort of, you know,
six or eight of the big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within the terpenes we see
mono-terpenes, myrcine typically
[SPEAKER_00]: dominates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sesquiterpenes, things like
beta-cariophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are all combining in that
mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what my research program has really
been doing over the last decade or so is
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out how cannabis makes
those compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the enzymes, what are the
genes for the enzymes that put these
[SPEAKER_00]: complex metabolites together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the secret of that experimental
approach has been the focus on glandular
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a funky picture I took of a
strain called skunk number one when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: a postdoc in Germany around 2000 or 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back, you know, that long ago I started
working on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at those female floral tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the stigmas where this,
you know, that receive the pollen as these
[SPEAKER_00]: white hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those crystal-y kind of structures on
the floral tissues are trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look a little bit more closely and we
see the stalked trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look even more closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually, these are hemp
trichomes, but hemp is still cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: after all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that nice stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a secretory disk of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the cells that are actually
making cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they secrete them into a kind of a
bag, a subcuticular space of goop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we get is the secretory disk
cells are kind of the cellular factories
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's that storage site in that
secretory cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as consumers, they would talk
about, you know, people talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: crystals and resin droplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really like a balloon of chemicals
or a Safeway bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's got a sort of a thin,
almost plastic, waxy skin on it to contain
[SPEAKER_00]: the metabolites in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can open them up just by,
you know, poking them or prodding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did as biochemists and
genomicists was say, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those secretory cell disks are where all
the action takes place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the factory is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can isolate them and then start
probing their biochemistry and
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically looking at what genes are
expressed, we can figure out how the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites that are produced and then
secreted there, cannabinoids and terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually produced in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that, and that process in the,
I'll go back one slide, shows you what we
[SPEAKER_00]: did was we took female floral tissues of a
high THC strain, put it in a bead beater,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a glorified blender, costs a lot
more than your typical blender,
[SPEAKER_00]: knocked the stuff apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bag of goop opens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disks separate from the top of the
stock, and then you can filter them off
[SPEAKER_00]: and purify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're into a relatively pure form.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of a, sort of a creamy color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can isolate RNA, ribonucleic
acid, which is the messenger from the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome through to the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, it's the active form of gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got RNA and then we started
sequencing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a gene expression catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gene expression catalog from the
glandular trichomes of high THC cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: was enriched for cannabinoid pathway
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we knew it was enriched was
initially we only had one enzyme in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done by the Professor Shoyama's
group in Kyushu University in Japan around
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC acid synthase is the last step in
the.
