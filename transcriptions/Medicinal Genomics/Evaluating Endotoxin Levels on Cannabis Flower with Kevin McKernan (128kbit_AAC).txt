[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to learn more about what
makes the CanMed Innovation and Investment
[SPEAKER_00]: Summit unlike any other cannabis
conference available, check out the link
[SPEAKER_00]: in the show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our marketing team put together a great
blog that highlights all the ways that
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is one of those familiar
CanMed names that I referenced earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin McKernan is the chief scientific
officer and founder of Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin has pioneered the genomics of
cannabis and hemp to build a stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific environment for the study of
cannabis-based therapeutics and using
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain technologies for tracking and
verifying cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 24, Kevin will present
understanding the prevalence and risks
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with endotoxins on cannabis
flower, which will include novel research
[SPEAKER_00]: he did to measure the level of endotoxins
in door-bought cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our conversation covers what inspired
Kevin to look into endotoxin levels on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, the microbes that produce
endotoxins and their effect on humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether remediation techniques mask
endotoxin risks, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Kevin, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Agilent Technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manufacture or test cannabis,
you face the challenge of delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: high-quality products, increasing sample
volume, and meeting emergent regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agilent offers best in-class cannabis and
hemp analysis solutions featuring robust
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments, software, services,
and consumables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their team of experts can develop,
implement, and optimize methods to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: up and running quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at Agilent.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Kevin McKernan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where you guys find such
trash to come on this podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: but here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're too modest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of our best guests and you are
our first guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can never take that one away from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to talk with you today
about something that's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different because in the past,
your CanMed presentations and when you've
[SPEAKER_00]: come on the podcast before, talked a lot
about sequencing, whether it's cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms or even viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year at CanMed 24, you're
presenting on something a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about endotoxins,
which isn't just a new topic for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's a new topic for the
industry overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into how or why the
industry should start thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: endotoxins, I think it's important to
explain what they are and why you became
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in investigating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'll start with the why first and
then lead to... Well, now let's do what
[SPEAKER_01]: they are first so people know why we're
anchoring into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So endotoxins are molecules that are found
on gram-negative bacteria on their cell
[SPEAKER_01]: wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they embed inside this lipid bilayer
and they're known to be really potent
[SPEAKER_01]: anaphylaxis agents if they're found in an
injectable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I used to work at Agincourt,
we had all this demand to make
[SPEAKER_01]: endotoxin-free plasmid purification kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a whole program and a whole
technology platform where we built these
[SPEAKER_01]: magnetic beads that stripped endotoxins
out of plasmid, perhaps, because if you
[SPEAKER_01]: need pharmaceutical-grade plasmids,
this is a real FDA concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to test them for endotoxins and
get rid of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I never really thought about it in
terms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly had forgotten about it for like
a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the reason they came to our
attention is that I think it was on
[SPEAKER_01]: LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little bit of a back and forth
going on about decontamination and
[SPEAKER_01]: mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Tess had some really
interesting information saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, we're not looking at the right
mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium makes them, bacteria make
endotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another group in Massachusetts
was asking a lot of questions about what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened in the pre-war facility in
Massachusetts where someone died.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has created a big storm here in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CDC has swept in to start measuring
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: OSHA is involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been fines handed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those who aren't familiar with this
case, I won't add the patient's name
[SPEAKER_01]: because I noticed the CDC documentation
didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll stick to their guidance here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a patient, it wasn't a patient,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an employee that worked in a
pre-war facility in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_01]: had allergic reaction in the facility and
died.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe she was a cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone was really confused by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if this person was allergic to
cannabis, she wouldn't be consuming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the hell happens in the pre-war
facility that suddenly made her have an
[SPEAKER_01]: asthmatic reaction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's some debate whether they had
the proper masks and the proper HEPA
[SPEAKER_01]: filters and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know where all that landed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I know is that by the time the CDC got
in there to try to measure this
[SPEAKER_01]: retrospectively, the facility had already
implemented some better HVAC to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: address this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they responded to try to mitigate
whatever risk they could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one really knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like something airborne must have gotten
to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's clean the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that had a lot of people asking us
like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there some microbe that makes a toxin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the microbial testing to blame?
[SPEAKER_01]: Preroles are notoriously higher in
microbial content for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're either lower quality flowers that
don't have bag appeal or maybe they're the
[SPEAKER_01]: lower branches and there's higher
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know the answer for that,
but they tend to have a higher microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: burden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe grinding them up is something
that liberates more of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is this possibility that they're
often decontaminated or irradiated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we don't have good labeling here in
Massachusetts to know if that was
[SPEAKER_01]: happening here or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a lot of people just asking
questions like, what do we do for,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not seeing patients die,
but if the employees that are handling
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff are dying, then you have to
assume there may be some artifacts that
[SPEAKER_01]: are hitting patients and they're just not
getting maybe reported as being connected
[SPEAKER_01]: to their cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that got me digging into the literature
a little bit on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone I know who's an endotoxin
specialist was like, oh yeah, you should
[SPEAKER_01]: know about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the tobacco fields had to deal
with this all the time, the tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarettes of endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, they don't think it's the
tobacco that's killing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think it's the endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some small branch of people
believe this, that the endotoxin is what's
[SPEAKER_01]: causing a bronchial inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not really the nicotine that's
doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the other contaminants in the
tobacco that tend to come along for the
[SPEAKER_01]: ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can create inflammation in the lungs
and COPD and asthma and a host of other
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that put me down a rabbit hole of
literature reading into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I stumbled across some literature
that implied 40% of the bacteria on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is gram negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Endotoxin loaded, which shocked me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went over to our informatics guy,
Steve, and said, is this true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like search our database for everything
we've ever sequenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one nice thing we have here at NBC is
there's like a thousand samples of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that have been sequenced,
mostly stems, but some roots, some flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: and leaves where we can measure like,
what's the microbiome content of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it true that 40% of these things
are in fact gram negative?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we combed through that for about a day
and we're like, yeah, the guy's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a whole lot of
klebsiella.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole lot of these other gram
negative bacteria that we're finding in
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbiome data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that person's spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where the project
started is we said, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: why don't we get ourselves an endotoxin
assay kit?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can run that on like a qubit,
which is one of these portable ferometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the cheapest thing you
could ever purchase for a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about, I don't know, $7,000 or
something to buy this qubit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use those for measuring DNA
concentrations and RNA concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of a universal Swiss army
knife, really affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like, all right, we can run it on
that thing and assess if there's any
[SPEAKER_01]: endotoxin on pre-rolls or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of evolved into asking
different questions of like, maybe we
[SPEAKER_01]: should look at cannabis that comes out of
the dispensary system because we know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: tested to have low CFU.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's look at some stuff that's in the
hemp market that isn't tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually even our experience,
the hemp market in Massachusetts has
[SPEAKER_01]: really high CFUs, everything from total
use of mold, total rub accounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grown outdoors, probably using a lot
of organic farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went around and got some samples
from hemp facilities and then purchased
[SPEAKER_01]: some from dispensaries that had been
through testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any knowledge of whether
they're using any decontamination
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one would naturally assume that when
you decontaminate these things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you prevent the microbes from growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever's there has endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the decontamination doesn't get rid of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's quite likely that it would be
remaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hemp samples we picked up were like
screaming hot, 3 million CFUs per gram,
[SPEAKER_01]: like off the scale hot, 30 times above the
limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, everything we pulled
from the dispensary side was clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very clean, almost zero,
100, maybe 1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used it most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went about running
quantitative PCR on those, plating those,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also looking at live dead with
quantitative PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one thing we noticed with modern
Kana was that we have this live dead kit
[SPEAKER_01]: that gets rid of dead DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when she was, I think it was,
oh, Ginny, Ginny, I'm forgetting her name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it, Clarice, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she did a nice study that she showed at
Kamen last year where she was using live
[SPEAKER_01]: dead PCR with Grim Reaper to look at
irradiated samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she noticed that in some cases,
the Grim Reaper didn't get rid of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lowered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still, in some cases, was testing
hot, whereas the plating was completely
[SPEAKER_01]: blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that got us looking into, OK,
is our nucleus not working?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there viable but not cultureable cells
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there, is there something about PCR
that's just the radiation can kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: organism but not destroy the DNA enough so
some of the dead DNA is still around and
[SPEAKER_01]: the DNA can't get to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of went down this rabbit hole
trying to figure out, why can't we get the
[SPEAKER_01]: live dead QPCR to perfectly match plating
after radiation?
[SPEAKER_01]: What she, I think, included from that
study was that, OK, what we'll have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is enrich after radiation to know if
there's anything there that's viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, we can use live dead PCR and a
little bit of enrichment and perhaps sort
[SPEAKER_01]: this problem out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it certainly left Tass and a few other
people in the field worried that if we
[SPEAKER_01]: build a pipeline in cannabis where people
can grow the dirtiest stuff possible and
[SPEAKER_01]: then just blast it at the end just because
it can counterfeit a plating system,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that really safe?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if it's loaded with mycotoxins and
endotoxins and all this other garbage and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just finding a way to evade the
detection tool that they're using in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry by doing this radiation thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, there's concerns over
it's not labeled and the patients don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it got us looking in that area a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, that's kind of how the
project snowballed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you did write up a great white paper
kind of summarizing this whole study,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'll put a link in the show
description so people can read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, you mentioned the results
and there's a great graph in here that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of shows that of sort of the
endotoxin levels and then the pre and post
[SPEAKER_00]: Grim Reaper information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, but when I look at that and
tell me if I'm reading this correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it looked like on every sample,
there was a significant level of
[SPEAKER_00]: endotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of the shocking thing
that we found was that there wasn't a
[SPEAKER_01]: sample that was free of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it varied several orders of magnitude
between the samples, but the lowest sample
[SPEAKER_01]: was several orders of magnitude over the
decost limit, which we're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: assess in the field what that limit should
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The decost limit for people who know is a
European standard for the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: endotoxin that can be in breathable air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have it set at 90 EUs per square
meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dealing with a gram of cannabis,
which is a million times smaller than a
[SPEAKER_01]: square meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're having numbers that are orders
of magnitude higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if they've set a standard
for like what that should be for an
[SPEAKER_01]: inhalable product, but I would assume that
the inhalable product should should
[SPEAKER_01]: probably be close to the limit for what's
tolerable for the employees in the in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some some studies listed in
there from the CDC and from a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: the parties where they went in to look at
the endotoxin levels just in the air at
[SPEAKER_01]: certain work environments in the cannabis
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CDC had one study that showed that 40
percent of the employees were exposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: levels that were higher than in the
trimming facility that were higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: the decost limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another study looked at this in hemp and a
couple of other like lung diseases that
[SPEAKER_01]: were showing up for workers that were that
were handling a lot of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's there have been a couple of the
data points looking at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to know that when the CDC
went in to this facility in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's what they began looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They began looking at for endotoxin
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their radar is up on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what got us looking at it is we
said, all right, if they're if that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're coming in to investigate,
we should probably get an understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: how much of this is actually just around
on the flowers, because we can't really
[SPEAKER_01]: find a whole lot of papers that speak to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can find some things on tobacco and a
couple of studies that were done in these
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental exposure studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so, yeah, the the numbers are very
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this, you know,
obviously, if this were so toxic,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of cannabis use out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would be dropping like flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't we don't see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what may have happened with this
unfortunate case is that this person may
[SPEAKER_01]: have had a preexisting condition of some
sort, asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this just was the hair that broke the
camel's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It maybe exacerbated the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got we have to pay maybe close
attention to patient use in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the medical field needs to think
a little bit more carefully about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the other thing that came up that
wasn't really mentioned in the paper that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been pondering since then is,
well, can we use gram positive bacteria as
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol agents to like outcompete this
stuff so it's not around?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacillus is something that's commonly used
as a as a biocontrol agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bacillus is gram positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you flood the plants with
Bacillus so you can knock out all the gram
[SPEAKER_01]: negatives and then we don't have this
problem anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may it may lead to better
cultivation techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the only challenge with
Bacillus, our PCR tests will hit it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: TAC amplicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't hit it on the E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli or the sex stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the the TAC plates from 3M will light
up with Bacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people are penalized right now
for using biocontrol agents that might
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigate this problem because the testing
the testing tools are using will pick it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really ironic because they
have this testing platform that tries to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow everything on plates and it's
penalizing for using the biocontrol agents
[SPEAKER_01]: that could get rid of the gram negatives
that, in fact, the testing platform you
[SPEAKER_01]: can then evade by radiating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this big, like circular nonsense that
we've got high TAC counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're radiated and it doesn't get rid
of the endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can put it on plates that that
basically don't show any growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the real answer may have been to
actually put Bacillus on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would fail your 3M plate and you
wouldn't have the endotoxin problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we have a lot to learn,
I think, in the microbial space and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some some citations in the
paper talking about what these exposure
[SPEAKER_01]: levels are like, what they learn from the
tobacco industry about this and how they
[SPEAKER_01]: try and keep those levels down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tobacco industry is obviously a little
bit different than every tobacco cigarette
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to tends to have a filter on it,
which we don't necessarily have on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis stuffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know how much of that is
scrubbing the endotoxin out of the out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do run tests on side stream and
stuff through filters to see how much is
[SPEAKER_01]: coming through in tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can, in fact, see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not measured tobacco leaves
themselves to see how much is on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we may do next week when
we get some new kits in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but yeah, the amount on cannabis
flowers is high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does vary orders of magnitude,
but it all seems to be above these D cost
[SPEAKER_01]: limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next question is, can you does
does pyrolytics kill this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem we have in the research field
is that endotoxin is one of these things
[SPEAKER_01]: that when it's around, you can't autoclave
your way out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tends to survive autoclaves,
which is like high pressure and heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what we're using to
vaporize cannabis is like low pressure and
[SPEAKER_01]: heat, but it's heat for like a brief
period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't it doesn't torch the whole
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just torches the tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a possibility that a lot of
endotoxin can come out of smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that'd be a really interesting
study if people can figure out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: capture endotoxin out of smoke stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the some of the people studying
the vape pens would be, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: wise to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's actually literature of
endotoxins in tobacco vape pens that the
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco process of people getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how that happens,
because I don't think they're extracting
[SPEAKER_01]: nicotine from from plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figure that was just a chemical
synthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put those things, but they have they
have noted endotoxin inside of tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: vape pens, in which case I'm really
curious to know how much of this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: actually ends up in the cannabinoid oils,
because it is it's a molecule that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's going to be more lipophilic and
that it likes to be in lipid bile hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So will will it end up in the extraction
enriched or will it end up in some other
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction of the distillation process?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of a lot more questions and answers
we have right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be particularly concerning
because I mean, as I understand it,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times a flower is failing for
microbial sort of the solution a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times is to extract it or turn it into
distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always assume that was the simple thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In which case, Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think maybe it was Jeff Raber.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of people have done studies on
some of the risks of extracting for
[SPEAKER_01]: safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the concerns was pesticides and
mycotoxins could enrich differentially in
[SPEAKER_01]: the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the cannabinoids might go from 20
percent to 80 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see the pesticides go from
like, you know, parts per millions to
[SPEAKER_01]: parts per thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they would enrich to a higher degree
than the cannabinoids themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they raised concerns over
differential capture of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are all good questions that we
have now for what this endotoxin can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, again, we've not seen people
drop in like flies and endotoxins,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there is this fatality here in mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has got the federal government
looking under the whole production process
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we are at the stage of maybe
de-scheduling or going to schedule three
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's going to be more federal
overhang on the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: we probably have to start paying attention
to what they're doing and start looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the source of these of these contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm really intrigued by the the
biocontrol agents with bacillus just
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you could flood the plants with
gram positives, then there's there's less
[SPEAKER_01]: likely for there to be an issue there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And likewise, there's a there's a I think
a valid point to many of the I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: points you've seen tests on LinkedIn raise
is like, look, it's never a good
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing process to do things dirty
and mop up at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to eventually build some level of
sterility into your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it can't be perfectly sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, plants need microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is such a wide variation in the
genetics that can that in terms of the CFU
[SPEAKER_01]: that you get like the work from Zemir was
really interesting that he showed the
[SPEAKER_01]: total yeast and mold ratios were or
genetic characteristic of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had plants that would always have
genetically would just have higher yeast
[SPEAKER_01]: and mold burdens than other lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was something that went with the
genetics of what they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that tells it tells you something
about, you know, we can find a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed cannabis that's low in these
microbial burdens so that we don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: mop up a mess at the end and wonder if
there's mycotoxins or endotoxins that are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming through that we can't measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are good ways to measure
mycotoxins and now endotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of those things that doesn't
shine through in every state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think every state has mandatory
mycotoxin testing and no one has endotoxin
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looking at the data we have now,
I'd be like, forget the mycotoxin,
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the endotoxin because it's
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talk to people who run the
mycotoxin test, they're like, we almost
[SPEAKER_01]: never get a hit on those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like it's a testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it the mycotoxins became,
you know, something that's required
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and endotoxins kind of went
unnoticed?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, mycotoxins made their way into the
food industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's they are more of an
oral ingestion risk because they tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: have effects on your liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas endotoxin isn't something that's
that's really an oral ingestion risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like the edible pipeline
doesn't need to worry about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really more of inhalation and
injection.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, injection is the real thing that
the FDA worries about because you can
[SPEAKER_01]: anaphylaxis and even drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But inhalation is something I think is
been one of these areas where I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to look up the pharma regs for like
the limits on this for like asthma
[SPEAKER_01]: inhalers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they're very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think when you get into the realm of
like tobacco and cannabis, you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you guys are inhaling like,
you know, pyrolytics anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who cares about what what else you're
adding?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think that they've had the
same like scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost as if you've committed
yourselves to performing something risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're probably not too concerned about
the other risks that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always this question that the
flame probably destroys it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not true, given the
temperatures that people say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it certainly adds a an element of the
pyrolytic seems to sometimes offer an out
[SPEAKER_01]: on what's present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a feeling it has something to do
with that, just that if you're inhaling
[SPEAKER_01]: these, if you're willing to light
something on fire, inhale it anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: then no one's got a lot of sympathy if
there's some contaminants around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the medicine, when it comes to
actual ingestion, it probably does need to
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to think about mycotoxins if
they're at high levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not seen a lot of people who test for
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they come out, you know, more than like
one percent positivity in testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always hear of like one in a thousand or
one in five hundred samples might pop
[SPEAKER_01]: positive for a mycotoxin test.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's nowhere near the it doesn't match
the level of like 10 percent failing for
[SPEAKER_01]: total use and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think if you had that much yeast and
old everywhere, you'd you'd you'd have
[SPEAKER_01]: some concordance with the actual mycotoxin
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we can see from this data is that,
yeah, when there's bacteria there and even
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's been zapped or it doesn't it
doesn't show like we can see in this
[SPEAKER_01]: paper, there is in some cases there is
bacterial DNA present and it doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tells us, OK, someone probably
decontaminated this and the endotoxin is
[SPEAKER_01]: screaming high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the DNA can maybe help navigate some of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when it comes down to some
samples that are just totally no DNA,
[SPEAKER_01]: no evidence of growth, but they're
screaming high with endotoxin,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we probably have to understand what
the lower limit can be from from a patient
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other point, too, when you talk
about sort of the pyrolytics or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, lighting it on fire might take
take care of the endotoxins, might,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, eliminate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't solve the problem of the
people who are working in the production
[SPEAKER_00]: facility or, you know, like the the person
in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you had you had a podcast on
with an expert who always brings up this
[SPEAKER_01]: point that when they do these pyrolytic
tests, that, yeah, there's a very high
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature at the very at the end of the
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rest of the joint is getting an
elevated temperature, but not hot enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to destroy the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get active spores coming out of
a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we've seen this in the
Bakersville case where they had
[SPEAKER_01]: cryptococcus infection of a patient and
they ended up with meningitis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, the the pre-rolls seem to be the
part of the pipeline that's dirtiest and
[SPEAKER_01]: where we see the most fails and where we
probably need to have the most attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have it in Oregon, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at the Oregon story there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they turned on aspergillus testing,
they were having like 10 to 20 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: failures in the pre-rolls, but their
flowers were down at like two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: percent like California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a signal that we tried to
make clear to the regulators that,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, you have a biological signal here
that would satisfy a Bradford Hill
[SPEAKER_01]: criteria for causation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have what's known to be a dirtier
process for making pre-rolls from from all
[SPEAKER_01]: the scrap material that's testing hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have, you know, high quality bag
of peel flour that's testing low.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is the sign of something
that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should look into this and maybe that
maybe the pre-rolls have to go through a
[SPEAKER_01]: different decontamination process and
maybe extra mycotoxin checks or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they've opted to just throw
their hands in the air and move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the I mean, the data that we're seeing
here in mass is is it's not something we
[SPEAKER_01]: can turn away from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the main argument they had in
Oregon is, well, no one's ever found
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who got hurt from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's a fine argument if you
put your head in the sand and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: look.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we actually have a fatality here in
Massachusetts and no one was necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person literally had to drop dead on
the floor at work for people to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how many people are getting
asthma attacks outside of the workplace
[SPEAKER_01]: and just consuming from consuming dirty
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going unregistered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a problem with a lot of the
cannabis literature out there is that for
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time of prohibition, we didn't
have people running into the hospital
[SPEAKER_01]: declaring, I'm a cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were hiding it because it could get
their kids taken away from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so the the the best we have
right now are studies from like the CDC
[SPEAKER_01]: that point to insurance data showing that,
OK, cannabis users have an elevated risk
[SPEAKER_01]: of of fungal infections and the ICD 10
codes like points of mucormycosis and
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillosis is like the two top risk
factors that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, it's a lot of people
sort of claiming, well, we never had to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this during prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why do we have to do it now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's that's fine if you want
to socialize the risks of the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not necessarily I think where
things are going to end up when the FDA
[SPEAKER_01]: gets involved, if they ever get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is that where you're you're kind of
hoping is one of the results of looking
[SPEAKER_00]: into this is that we should kind of start
looking or at least, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: consider that endotoxins might be a factor
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think others should look into
this, but no one should take our work
[SPEAKER_01]: alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pre-print right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be reproduced and it should be
reproduced in multiple jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_01]: before any regulator gets crazy with this,
because we don't know what this means.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we want to see is lots of
reproduction in the academic space or in
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just in the scientific
literature and then get some assessment as
[SPEAKER_01]: to is this is this associated with other
people having asthma attacks?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very of all the things that we can
do in the cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably the cheapest thing one
can measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sad to say we don't have any like
revenue stream attached to this thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is a it's not it's not our
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just buying this stuff from Thermo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but it's very cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very you know, small format.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys can see this,
but right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your background is fighting against us
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to put it on my face if you see it
over my forehead.
[SPEAKER_01]: People listening can't see this,
but this is basically a standard curve of
[SPEAKER_01]: a LAL assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's one of these assays that we
get an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me a picture, I can
superimpose it up there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably one of the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's so there's this clotting
factor in the blood of the horseshoe crab,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is blue blood, that actually when
endotoxin shows up, it creates a clotting
[SPEAKER_01]: cascade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've they've hijacked that that
enzyme to to to create this sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorometric assay that that basically
gives you a different color based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of endotoxin that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, this is something that runs in
a portable fluorometer that's that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could it's smaller than a PCR machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the cheapest thing anyone
could possibly put into a cannabis testing
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it only it's probably only ten bucks a
sample or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is it is really fast and cheap to
run this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that is run quite
frequently in the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure there's an endotoxin in any
of the drugs and any injectables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a large industry behind how to
do this and do it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the one challenge that I think
we've had with the assay is that you you
[SPEAKER_01]: do have to run this in matrix because the
LAL assay, there isn't a really good way
[SPEAKER_01]: to purify endotoxin away from all the
other stuff that it's with, which means
[SPEAKER_01]: you're having to take cannabis flower,
homogenize it, dilute it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, we basically diluted one to ten
after we put a gram of cannabis in ten
[SPEAKER_01]: mls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take one micro to that and dilute it
one to ten and pop it into this assay and
[SPEAKER_01]: we get these screaming high signals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do if you do it any more
concentrated in that, the terpenes or I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what, but something seems to be
interfering with the assay and you get you
[SPEAKER_01]: get an under recording of the event when
you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, other than that,
we've been able to go through probably two
[SPEAKER_01]: dozen samples now of different flowers to
show that we can get we can we can pick it
[SPEAKER_01]: up with this portable device that is is is
fairly cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the the reagents are very time
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the moment you crack them, you got to
use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise you start it's the assay starts
taking off on background endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the only downside that we're
using is it's you can't like crack the
[SPEAKER_01]: vials and leave them out on the bench for
two days and expect to get good results
[SPEAKER_01]: the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to kind of be really fast with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so, yeah, I don't know where we'll go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope the other side of this is that
could be really interesting as a
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration with a testing laboratory is
that there are other techniques out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that measure endotoxin with mass spec and
they're far more accurate and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're far more expensive and they're
not portable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this but but they're really
good tools to like validate like,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right, is this really working the way
we need it to with the cannabis background
[SPEAKER_01]: that's there?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always good to have a second assay
to kind of check the books on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to the extent any other cannabis
lab out there has done endotoxin testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: please reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love to like share notes and how we
could try to calibrate these things to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and see if there's you know,
there might be a way people can just turn
[SPEAKER_01]: on their turn their mass specs onto a
different column or a different assay and
[SPEAKER_01]: read this with equipment they already
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would be helpful study because I
think as more and more of these
[SPEAKER_01]: decontamination tools come to market,
we have to understand what it is we're
[SPEAKER_01]: hiding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one thing to get rid of total
aerobic count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total aerobic count is one of these weird
things where it's like you don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: know if it's harmful or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just counting total microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and when you start doing these cleanup
techniques, yeah, you're getting rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: what can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But are you getting rid of what you're
most worried about, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: endotoxin?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, you know, we're blinding
ourselves perhaps and giving ourselves a
[SPEAKER_01]: false sense of security with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this might be a tool that can help
either guide that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one thing that we're we're working
on next on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually I have to compliment
Tess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm forgetting her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to butcher her last name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you know her from some of the
great podcasts she's done and put on
[SPEAKER_01]: LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: She looked at her paper and was like,
this is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you could do do more replicates,
which is always good advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what about getting rid of the
gram positive bacteria out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you get a better PCR correlation?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look in our paper, our correlation
between like qPCR and endotoxin is like
[SPEAKER_01]: point four, three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not like you could use the qPCR
to predict this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of that lack of correlation
is that we're not segregating the gram
[SPEAKER_01]: negative from the gram positive in our
qPCR test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just measuring total aerobic count.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've gone and designed some PCR
primers that are going to do try to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: better job of like only give me
amplification from gram positives and only
[SPEAKER_01]: give me amplification from gram negatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can try to correlate the
endotoxin levels with those PCR signals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe those signals will like get a
point six or point seven percent
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the quantitative PCR test would not
only count all tact, but would split them
[SPEAKER_01]: into two different channels of positives
and negatives, in which case they may have
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more predictive power to run
after after decontamination to know,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, how much how much residual DNA is here
that was negative because the gram
[SPEAKER_01]: negative DNA is what we want to make sure
is is really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would tell us that the plant started
with very little gram negative and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore that's unlikely to have
endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're poking around at some assays like
that to see if they if they better inform
[SPEAKER_01]: on the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be honest, the PCR might be helpful
in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the endotoxin stuff runs just as
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a 30 minute assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it runs on a device that's that's much
like smaller footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hard to parallelize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we can't run 96 at a time without the
reagents kind of going bad in the process
[SPEAKER_01]: of setting up 96 assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have it's great for running about
eight at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to probably start over
with another strip tube of eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the PCR stuff we can really crank
through and it might help us inform on all
[SPEAKER_01]: right, what's what's going on with this,
the whole decontamination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it seems like definitely an
interesting line of inquiry that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to continue to look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, is there other resources
you would like to point the audience to
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can learn more about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to share any ways that they
can get in touch with you, please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, certainly, yeah, you can find me at
this medicinal genomics at that address.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think I put a sub stack up on
this bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the there's the pre print we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the pre print has a good list of
like, what have other regulators looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis field regarding endotoxin?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in the tobacco field?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the what are the limits people
have had in the past?
[SPEAKER_01]: And and there are sort of first go at
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would caution folks, we just started
doing this in like November.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're by no means experts at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we figured when the data came out,
like as loud as it was like, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: we got to at least get this out there and
let others know and see if anyone else can
[SPEAKER_01]: like tell us where we're wrong or which
direction we should go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if others are interested in studying
this, like bring us up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're open for collaboration on this
because this is something that is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: new to us, at least in the cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're kind of interested in where this
where this may lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feel free to drop us a note at you can
