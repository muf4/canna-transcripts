[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for rushing out of the break and
coffee to come spend a little bit of time
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Deborah Kimlis, and I'm really
excited to share with you some really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting research that we're doing
through PG Pharma and some water-soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: ICBD and PEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to me consulting with PG
Pharma and doing exciting things,
[SPEAKER_00]: I represent a bunch of other companies as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to do a shout out to Dr. Mike
from Andaraj.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's talking tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a shout out to the sponsors here for
medicinal genomics, RS Biotherapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go stop by their booth and talk to them
about some really cool stuff that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank the McKernan family
and Doug Kennedy for always welcoming me
[SPEAKER_00]: to participate in this conference and to
create a safe space for everybody to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their knowledge and really get to
understand things either within their
[SPEAKER_00]: scope or outside of their scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2016, I was so proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there at Harvard presenting a poster
on using low-dose cannabis oil to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: or replace opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2017, I shared some case reports using
low-dose cannabis oil for prostate cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: and brain cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why am I taking this trip down
memory lane when we're really supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be talking about diabetic neuropathic
pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's at this conference where Dr.
Rafael Mishulam was sitting in France
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, you know, there's a bunch of other
molecules out there, cannabinoid-like
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really sure why anybody doesn't
look at those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: First answer was because, you know,
they're not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't come from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And second is because I'm not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided that I would sort of explore
what he was suggesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of those was called PEA,
palmitil ethanolamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a little bit of research,
played around with it, and then did what
[SPEAKER_00]: all scientists do, tried on themselves,
and then tried on their friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2018, I was able to present a
little study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very lightweight in its robustness
as far as studies go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really lends some information and
credence to the power of the combination
[SPEAKER_00]: of low-dose CBD, PEA, and a sublingual
tablet for the treatment of mild to
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that it seemed to have worked,
or my friends and family didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hurt my feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks at PG Pharma, Steve Goldner,
a visionary, decided to take it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that we need randomized
control, you know, trials that are blinded
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have placebos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a little bit scary for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, Steve, before we go ahead and
jump into the space, let's figure out some
[SPEAKER_00]: dose-arranging studies, and let's look at
whether or not there's some efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a single arm-open trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we looked at sublingual CBD,
PEA combination for the treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: painful diabetic neuropathic pain of the
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why so specific?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you go to the FDA,
they want an indication specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after we had our pre-IND meeting,
this is what we left with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we looked at diabetics as a scope
for business, because pure research is
[SPEAKER_00]: great, but does this make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over 37 million people in the US
alone with diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 25% of them, or a quarter of them,
will end up with painful diabetic
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathic pain of the feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends up being a
four-plus-billion-dollar cost to health
[SPEAKER_00]: care costs, direct costs, a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be something very
interesting to pursue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are already some FDA-approved
medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a secret to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some are off-label use, some are FDA
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have variable consistencies or
efficacies to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether they're working or not,
there's a ton of side effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: from something mild to nausea and insomnia
to confusion to suicidal ideation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we figured there's got to be a better
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at CBD and PEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both very interesting lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palmitoyl phenolmide is endogenous to
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many plants, sadly not the cannabis
plant, as pointed out to me again by my
[SPEAKER_00]: cousin Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD is, of course, a molecule of
interest, especially since the passing of
[SPEAKER_00]: the foreign bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some studies looking at these
two molecules individually in mouse models
[SPEAKER_00]: for diabetic neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And multimodal mechanisms of action,
but it seemed to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are two publications supporting
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a little bit of proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they took steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, meaning the formulators at PG
Pharma, took steps in trying to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: the bioavailability, because these are all
fat molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD was complex with cyclodextrin.
[SPEAKER_00]: PEA was ultramicronized and administered
through a sublingual tablet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we did an open-label study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was dose-controlled and was
prospective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our endpoints were safety and efficacy,
of course, pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wanted to see what would
happen with sleep and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those seem to be common side
effects when you have chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we onboarded 31 participants,
13 male, 18 female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to have an average seven-day NPR
score, so a pain scale score of five or
[SPEAKER_00]: greater, due to their foot pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dosed them at 20 milligrams of CBD plus
100 milligrams of PEA three times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were permitted to stay on their
pain meds as long as their pain scale
[SPEAKER_00]: score before they were onboarded was five
or greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so interesting, the pain responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the orange bars,
that's the ones with the patients who
[SPEAKER_00]: continue their medicines for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yellow ones are the ones that
never took it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just sort of were sucking up their
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both had a very, very similar
starting point for their average NPRS pain
[SPEAKER_00]: score, not statistically significantly
different from the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after the trial, both of them
reduced about the same, greater than three
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half points.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at their highest pain
scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not statistically significant
difference, although the people on FDA and
[SPEAKER_00]: off-label use medications had a higher
average pain scale score than those that
[SPEAKER_00]: did not take any pharmaceutical
medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they had a statistically
significant reduction in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find this incredibly exciting,
especially for the next couple of slides
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a HAM-A, the Hamilton anxiety
score.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the number, the higher the
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower the number, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not a statistical significant
difference between those on meds and those
[SPEAKER_00]: not on medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a statistically significant
reduction in their pain scale score.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with sleep response.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the number in this case,
the better the sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, no difference really
statistically between the difference of
[SPEAKER_00]: the people on medicines and those that
were not taking any.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, an improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the coolest thing was no adverse
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now granted, NF-31, it's small,
but it really did inform us as to whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not we should pursue this and whether
or not this dosing is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the scariest of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longest eight months of my life,
randomized double-blind placebo control
[SPEAKER_00]: trial using the sublingual tablets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our end points were similar, pain,
anxiety, sleep, and then patient's global
[SPEAKER_00]: impression of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how they perceive they responded to
the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we onboarded 54 people that were
randomized, either active or placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did get them off all of their
medication, which was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average duration for people for
suffering with this PDPN was greater than
[SPEAKER_00]: seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been dealing with this for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these studies were done during
COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this was decentralized remote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to do a washout period if they
were on any medication, including
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were allowed to take rescue medicine
of their choice, either acetaminophen or
[SPEAKER_00]: ibuprofen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the treatment again was for 28 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interesting thing, pre-treatment,
the average MPR score for both arms was
[SPEAKER_00]: 7.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD randomized group was 3.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, 7.19.
[SPEAKER_00]: The placebo group was 7.44, so no
statistical difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after four weeks, post-treatment
dropped to 3.63, and the placebo group
[SPEAKER_00]: plateaued at about 5.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was statistically significant
reduction in pain in the treatment arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest average was 8.74.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the CBD group, 8.72 in the placebo
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not a statistical difference in
either one of those groups pre-treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then post-treatment, a statistical
significant reduction in pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.93 in the CBD group, and the plateaued
at 7.02 in the placebo arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is incredibly exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think is even more exciting is
what I like to say doesn't meet the SOWAT
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SOWAT test means great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have statistical significance,
but is it meaningful to the patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it clinically important?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a tremendous impact,
right, for us clinicians who are treating
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know great statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do patients say?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the MCID for PDPN of the feet,
believe it or not, there is one,
[SPEAKER_00]: using an MPR score is a reduction in two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a pain scale score of
eight, and it goes down to six,
[SPEAKER_00]: patients actually recognize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average change in this study,
in this cohort, the CBD group had a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction of minus 3.56 in their MPR score
versus the placebo group of only 1.74.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only did it meet statistical
significance, it meets the SOWAT test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should get extra minutes for this
clicker not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, the anxiety showed an
improvement in MCID, but was not a
[SPEAKER_00]: statistical significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know if our, this was not
an anxious bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This group had only mild to moderate
elevation in anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our N might have been small,
or as what Ethan Russo says, small amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD may not do anything for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be that reason as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sleep scale score, same thing that
met the MCID requirement, but was not
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested in seeing what a larger
N would look like with this treatment over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the patient's global impression of
change, it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at activity, abilities,
symptoms, emotions, overall quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look and say, is it better,
is it worse since treatment, or it really
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people in the treatment arm said,
yes, they reported a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement in all of those scores while
on the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And safety, because at the end of the day,
as a physician, do no harm, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: or try to at least reduce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the CBD PEA group, there were zero
reported adverse events, and there was one
[SPEAKER_00]: case of abdominal distress which led,
abdominal distress to me, because it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: placebo group and it were blinded and I
didn't know it until I had a checkup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm gonna take it at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary for this, this is an
incredible opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been listening to exciting,
important information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you went to the other group
yesterday where they were talking about we
[SPEAKER_00]: need more trials and we need more research
so that people can get funding,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are the trials and research that are
important and not what people are asking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there are any investors out there,
or anybody who's interested in pharma
[SPEAKER_00]: development, I put a challenge to you to
either continue to invest in research like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing or come up to any of the
companies that are out there today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this isn't exciting to you,
there's lots of other cool stuff going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is some of the things that you
should be looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at least in this small group of
people, we've demonstrated some efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: with this combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, as a nerd, my favorite group,
the Carpenters have said, we've only just
[SPEAKER_00]: begun and we then decided, well we,
PG Pharma Group, that we package this up
[SPEAKER_00]: in a nice, neat way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think there should be smooth sailing
going to the FDA for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my backyard, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are always surprises when you
least expect it, especially when dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yes, we are dealing with lots of
surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're answering those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the questions require a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone's out there and excited about
this and want to participate, this is our
[SPEAKER_00]: team of robust, smart scientists and
chemists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you, and if anybody has any
questions, I'm willing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sharing, Deb.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question has to do with the reception
you've had at FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So combining CBD, a phytocannabinoid with
PEA, an endogenous and synthetic agent,
[SPEAKER_01]: they must consider this a combination
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the problems, what are the
steps that they've made to go through
[SPEAKER_01]: along the path towards acceptance?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, excellent question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you asked me that four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we went and had our pre-IND meeting,
they did not mention anything about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we submitted to open our IND,
that was the first question they asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to see a combination tox
study, which is what our next steps have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in order to pull this through,
which is not cheap, which is a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious, did I hear you correctly say
that you got them all off their
[SPEAKER_02]: medications before starting this study?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got them off of all of their treatments
for the PDPN, not all of their medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they had issues with diabetes or
right, or a lung issue or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: they stayed on those meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got them off like their
gabapetinoids and the deloxetines and
[SPEAKER_00]: amitriptyline and those types of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many of them went back to
that after the study?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't follow up with that, with that
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, congratulations getting them off
those meds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a fun fact, our protocol for the FDA
keeps patients on their current
[SPEAKER_00]: medications as long as their MPR score is
five or greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a request to the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: No?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
Thank you.
