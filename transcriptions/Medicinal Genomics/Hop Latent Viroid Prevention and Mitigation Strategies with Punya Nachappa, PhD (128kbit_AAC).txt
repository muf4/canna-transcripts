February 20th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are planning on joining us in
Puerto Rico this June, don't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy your ticket today and enjoy those
savings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're still on the fence,
I invite you to go to canmedevents.com and
[SPEAKER_01]: check out our speaker lineup, our
schedule, and the unique networking events
[SPEAKER_01]: we have put together to connect you with
the leaders who are shaping the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a heads up, we will plan to announce
details about our cannabis genomics
[SPEAKER_01]: workshop later this week, which is going
to be one of the greatest collections of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis genomics experts ever assembled.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are at all interested or curious
about how genomic sequencing can be used
[SPEAKER_01]: to create novel varieties, protect IP,
and breed for pest and pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance, this is a workshop you don't
want to miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sign up for email alerts at canmedevents
.com to make sure you do not miss that and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the other announcements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest today is Dr. Punya Nachapa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Punya is an associate professor at
Colorado State University in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Agricultural Biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her research program focuses on
understanding the interactions between
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and insect vectors to manage plant
pests and diseases in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: At CanMed 25, Punya will present biology
and management of hoplatin viroid,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will describe the impact of HLVD on
hemp yield and cannabinoids, explain how
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips and aphids transmit the viroid,
and evaluate the efficacy of using
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical elicitors to control HLVD
infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: During our conversation, we discussed how
hoplatin viroid has been reported in every
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp-grown state in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Canada, how HLVD spreads through
infected clones, mechanical contact,
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, and insect vectors like aphids and
thrips, possible reasons why hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties appear more resistant than
cannabis varieties, including genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity and environmental factors,
the trade-offs associated with using
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical elicitors on infected plants,
and strategies for preventing HLVD spread,
[SPEAKER_01]: including strict sanitation, insect
monitoring, frequent testing, and breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: for genetic resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Punya, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Founded in 1999, Advanced Nutrients was
the first to develop a complete nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: system that unlocks the true genetic
potential of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since its inception, the brand has
introduced more than 50 innovations to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation community and continues to
revolutionize the space through
[SPEAKER_01]: proprietary scientific discoveries.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Punya Nachapa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Punya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been several years that I did my last
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to be back here talking about
another important pathogen in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were on the podcast before talking
about beet curly top virus in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put a link to the show in the show
description so people can check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember after we did that,
I was saying that you need to come down to
[SPEAKER_01]: CanMed and that year it didn't work out,
but we're excited that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: in Puerto Rico this year giving a talk on
one of our favorite topics, poplite and
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been listening to the podcast
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a number of different talks on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an emerging problem in the cannabis
space and it always gets a lot of viewers
[SPEAKER_01]: and listeners because it is so
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited for you to share some new
information that you've learned about the
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid and that you'll be sharing at
CanMed 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get into the new stuff,
I was hoping for those new listeners or
[SPEAKER_01]: new viewers, you could provide an overview
of hoplite and viroid and explain its
[SPEAKER_01]: significance to the hemp and cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you mentioned, hoplite and viroid is an
emerging pathogen, but probably doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: need much introduction because it's just
spread like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should no pun intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA is battling these fires, but it's been
such a pain to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, as the name suggests,
it was identified in hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first host, but very quickly
jumped from hops to the nearest relative
[SPEAKER_00]: of hops, cannabis, and seems to be having
a more severe impact in cannabis than it
[SPEAKER_00]: did in hops, where it did affect the
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in cannabis, it seems to have a more
significant impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was identified or at least
published reports was in 2019,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe the industry had an idea of what
was happening a couple of years before
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first reports came out in 2019 in
cannabis, and then my lab subsequently
[SPEAKER_00]: found it in our field survey of hemp here
in Colorado in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, pretty much every hemp growing state
has reported hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spread all the way in New Mexico up
to Washington, and Canada has also been
[SPEAKER_00]: ravaged by this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I saw somewhere that the reported
impact was $4 billion annually to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, which is staggering
because it impacts the flower really
[SPEAKER_00]: badly, causing that so-called dudding
where the flower, it impacts the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, and that's where the
cannabinoids are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and THC levels are reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, the biomass, the plant is
stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are issues with the quality of the
plant, all in all impacting economics and
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream pharmacological applications as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this is well characterized in
cannabis, but in hemp with the THC legally
[SPEAKER_00]: classified as cannabis sativa with THC
levels of less than 0.3% dry weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did not know the actual impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although field studies have shown that we
can either report it or identify it in
[SPEAKER_00]: field grown hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the research areas that we
focused on in the last couple of years to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a systematic study to understand the
impact on field grown hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been very aware of the problem in the
cannabis industry, and of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing indoors, growing from clone,
and how that's a great way for HOVD to
[SPEAKER_01]: spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't quite aware that it was being
seen in outdoor hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the reports from these other
states, at least in the universities,
[SPEAKER_00]: were not allowed to work on cannabis,
so nothing over 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the Department of Agriculture
here at Colorado CDA would periodically
[SPEAKER_00]: come and test our plants to make sure we
are under the legal limit and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go far.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the reports from these different
states were made in field grown hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: except the ones from California,
the initial ones came from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are finding it in field grown hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we just published, it's not out yet,
what we call a metagenome or a metavirome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're surveying hemp, send it out for
sequencing, and then try to identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last one, we did, this was 2022-23,
we did not find hoplite and viroid in
[SPEAKER_00]: field grown hemp, which is good news,
at least for the hemp growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole other suite of new viruses
that we've found, but not hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid, which we did back in 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You found it in 2021, but your more recent
survey is that you're not finding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not finding it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any ideas where it went?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this might segue into some of the
data that I'll be presenting in CanMed,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we did a field study to see the
impact of hoplite and viroid on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The infection rate was very low in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really difficult to get hemp
infected with hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposedly highly transmissible,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the TMV, tobacco mosaic virus,
which is a highly transmissible virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often called the TMV of the viroid
world, but we couldn't get our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might have to do with the
genetic diversity of hemp as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the clone only propagated, hydroponically
grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: This field, well, it's kind of a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it a cravo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be partly covered or you keep it
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's a hybrid between a
greenhouse and a field, but you plant the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be considered field grown hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this study, the plants look just
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we may have gotten like 10%
infection rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the healthy environment,
the genetics of hemp made it just outgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: or out-compete the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the other aspect is, you know,
we do these surveys or just look going
[SPEAKER_00]: into our fields, whatever variety the
grover has, we are sampling that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that certain varieties of hemp
are more susceptible and some are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much left to be researched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were very surprised not to find any
poplite in viroid in our second
[SPEAKER_00]: metagenome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What tissues were you testing,
if I may ask?
[SPEAKER_00]: A good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always do the leaves with hemp,
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in cannabis, you often do the
roots, which again, you know, because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing conditions, it's easier with
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are much harder to extract from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only test, we test the apical
leaves, but we also sample from different
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the plant because we are seeing
that, and this has already been known,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of Dr. Poonja's work has shown it's
not equally distributed in all parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are very confident about our
sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also test the stem, didn't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And metagenomics is a highly sensitive
technique, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get a few reads, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we detected zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that some research and some of
the research that our CSO has done here
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, purposely inoculating some
plants, the viroid will go down into the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots and sometimes stay there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, it never kind of
progresses up into the later stages of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and it goes through flower and it
looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you test the roots, it's there,
but it never really emerges higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something like that in the
hemp too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were thinking about actually testing
the soil that we did our field study in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's something we are planning to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my questions were any of your,
what were some of your most surprising
[SPEAKER_01]: findings in regards to your study?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a very surprising finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, well, once we were, you know,
my former master's students, he just
[SPEAKER_00]: graduated, Luke Tile did this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were going out there, I mean,
he just lived there in that cradle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that this is, you know,
we're not going to see any significant
[SPEAKER_00]: changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any of the yield parameters,
cannabinoids, we were still unsure,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then we decided to separate out the
symptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did have a few symptomatic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we separated out the symptomatic
plants and the asymptomatic plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and both were HLBD positive by PCR,
but when we did that, we saw a reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: in CBD and THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit more nuanced than
just positive and negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers have to really keep an eye out
for the symptoms because the asymptomatic
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, like you said, just did fine,
but they are indeed positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was an interesting finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think others are also figuring it out,
but so many different things, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so many things were different between our
study and what's happening in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not published data,
and I don't know if I could present this
[SPEAKER_00]: in CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a screen of 30 hemp genotypes that
we got from one of our collaborators here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hemp genetics company called New
West Genetics that we work closely with
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Port Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do see some genetic diversity,
some variation in a blatant viral level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this was exciting and new data
for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and in reading through your abstract
as well, it said that you found that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis aphids and thrips can acquire and
transmit HLBD as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a bit more about the
significance of that discovery?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was, it was not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, what was surprising was that in
hops, they found that hops aphid did not
[SPEAKER_00]: transmit hop latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in our world, I mean, aphids,
as you can see in my background,
[SPEAKER_00]: see how prolific they are on hemp,
and they can pretty much, and they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: shown to transmit other viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of surprising that they
didn't find it in hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we set out to test aphids and
thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we picked those are they
are the most common greenhouse pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They love the greenhouse environment with
its hot, humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes the populations grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a year round supply of host,
host plants for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within five minutes, both insects can
acquire the viroid, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the phloem and aphids feed in the
phloem of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also in the, but thrips have much
shorter mouthparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids mouthparts are like mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the mosquitoes of the plant world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can go all the way down to the
phloem and suck up the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips are not, but they must be picking
it up from their cell content feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to just suck up all the cell
content, cytoplasm, nucleus, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are different mechanisms by which
they're acquiring the viroid, but both are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any insect could acquire it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the proof of the concept was to then
test transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, we then starve the insects
to make sure all of the gut content is out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just in there transiently,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we place those insects on healthy
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, both of them can
transmit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my other master's student is
retesting some things, but retesting some
[SPEAKER_00]: assays, but it's between 10 to 25%
transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sequence every single amplicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just rely on the band,
on the PCR gel band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one is sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not entirely surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one that I'm very keen to test
is spider mites, which is another huge
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, a huge greenhouse pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also find it in outdoor hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of other insects to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other interesting aspect is last year,
we saw that hops can also infect other
[SPEAKER_00]: hosts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really important hosts, host plants
like tomatoes, and chrysanthemums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanna see if these vectors,
cannabis aphids or thrips, can transmit it
[SPEAKER_00]: to other host plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it just takes a few minutes to
acquire and seemingly a few minutes to
[SPEAKER_00]: transmit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what about, I remember from our last
conversation, the leaf hoppers,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know that those transmit the
beet curly topvirus, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not, we've not thought about leaf
hoppers, but I'm gonna make a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are not a huge greenhouse pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need, so that's the, so,
but, you know, hemp, HOVD is outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would hypothesize because they are
plume feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason why they would not be
able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the level of the efficiency would be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at you, Ben, you are a budding
entomologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pay attention, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that you brought up,
the significance of starving the insects
[SPEAKER_01]: before you kind of test the transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So explain kind of the reason that's
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when insects consume the
plant sap or, you know, they chew the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves like a caterpillar would,
whatever is in the leaf is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillar or in the aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to grind it up and test it,
they would be positive for, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean they can transmit it
because once they poop it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: so goes the pathogen with the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be called a vector, the virus or the
viroid have to bind to the insect mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: part, to the stylet, and then bind in the
gut and then bind, and again, find the
[SPEAKER_00]: salivary glands and come out through that
mechanism, not just be pooped or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, transiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, we allow like a two to
four hour starvation period because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: shown to get rid of all the gut contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go ahead and you do your
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that it's just kind of taking
infected flow or sap from one plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: depositing it elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually systemic within the insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way the process works is insects
pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attaches to the stylet, you know,
stylet is the mouth part, goes into the
[SPEAKER_00]: gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the viroid will then come out of the
gut into the body cavity, where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the insects have something called
hemolymph, which is the blood of the
[SPEAKER_00]: insect, and then reach the salivary
glands, get into the salivary glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the insect feeds on a healthy
plant through the saliva, the viroid has
[SPEAKER_00]: to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole mode of transmission has to
happen for it to be called a vector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to add one thing I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing acquisition assays,
you know, how quickly they can acquire it,
[SPEAKER_00]: how quickly they can transmit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we want to know, like I told you,
this mode of transmission within the
[SPEAKER_00]: insect, we are doing some confocal
microscopy where we tag the viroid with
[SPEAKER_00]: GFP, you know, the green fluorescence
protein that can glow and show us all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of the insect body that
the viroid is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a good understanding of how it's
circulating systemically in the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other things that kind of stood
out from when I was looking at your
[SPEAKER_01]: abstract was using potential chemical
elicitors to kind of, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigate some of the negative effects of
HLVD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please tell us more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chemical elicitors or synthetic
elicitors, also called plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators, as the name suggests,
it's a chemical that mimics plant
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's essentially giving the plants a
little boost to get their defenses going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not, you know, I didn't come
up with this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been using it in plant pathology and
in entomology research as a way to trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: plant defenses, give them a little boost
to get it activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also think of it as a way to
prime the plants and it can protect
[SPEAKER_00]: against diseases and pathogens because
naturally plant hormones or what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: phytohormones are doing this, but they're
doing it at a low level so that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the plant can devote all the
resources to the different functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to give it this boost so it can
get activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that I was interested in
this research is because cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: can be considered organic production
systems, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the repertoire of insecticides and
pesticides are so limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are only a handful of
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know their efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that these chemical
elicitors are actually registered for use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the reasons we went we
were interested in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our idea was to just boost the
plant's innate inherent immunity to better
[SPEAKER_00]: defend the viral weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was this prior to infection?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we didn't do it prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we infected the plant a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the plant going with the
infection and then a week later we sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: these elicitors and then sprayed every
week for up to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then subsequently, I think at the
fourth or the fifth week, we took tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: and analyzed for HLVD levels using qPCR
and then let the plants go to flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: and then did the cannabinoid analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we debated, should we do it spray
first, then infect or infect and then
[SPEAKER_00]: spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to do and I decided to do the
former because so we got clones from
[SPEAKER_00]: infected plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were already infected,
ready to go because that's probably a more
[SPEAKER_00]: natural, we figured that's probably more
of the natural situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are already infected.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what were the results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know this already and this is how
it goes with research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never, yes, perfect result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always more questions to be asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray ops, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did two rounds of it and we're actually
getting ready to do a third round.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results were mixed bag,
but very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was, yes indeed,
a certain phytohormones or chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: elicitors reduced HLVD levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, they also increased the
biomass, you know, the yield of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we were excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But go to look at the flower production
and cannabinoid levels and the major ones
[SPEAKER_00]: like CBD and THC was actually reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could pull it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you biomass, like almost 50% for
salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biomass... Increased 50%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to an infected plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're all infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to... So the control was ethanol
because that's the solvent, salicylic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In ethanol, the biomass per plant was 8.3
grams and in the salicylic acid sprayed,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these phytohormones also caused
the plants to... Caused cell division,
[SPEAKER_00]: delay senescence, and essentially giving
it better overall health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just picking salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all look pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other ones I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassinolide was 12.8 grams compared to 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little less than 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pick salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC or THCA was 1900 microgram per gram
in the control in ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in SA, it was 1300 microgram per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that math?
[SPEAKER_00]: 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much?
[SPEAKER_00]: 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically a 100% increase in biomass,
but a 30% decrease in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not so interesting because guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: After we did this... This was a two-year
study from 2022 and he graduated in fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fall, here comes our really nice study,
and I can talk about that, showing that in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact, higher levels... Our goal was to
cause induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aim of our study, because we were kind
of going blind, was we want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: these pathways in the plants, salicylic
acid or what have you, was turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went a little high on the dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a paper came out saying higher
dosage can reduce cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas the lower dosage... So since that
paper came out, now we've got to fine-tune
[SPEAKER_00]: the rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so over-applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can reduce HLBD levels and biomass,
but does not have the same impact for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, which is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to fine-tune this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're redoing that experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already started and I should have
some new data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is some fine-tuning in figuring
that out, but some potential there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, for sure there's potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, we applied 10 millimolar of
salicylic acid and the papers are saying
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.5 is probably the better value,
better concentration to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might not...
[SPEAKER_00]: We may not see an induction on a PCR gel
of the salicylic acid pathway marker gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to play around with the
dosage and timing to fine-tune that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because growers don't have too many
options for these, for HLBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other nice thing about these
elicitors is they also come for protection
[SPEAKER_00]: against pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: My own lab has shown, like salicylic acid
can reduce thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are literally... And jasmonic acid
are good against aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually kill two birds with
one stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a matter of fine-tuning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now in terms of accessibility to these
compounds, these chemicals, whatever we're
[SPEAKER_01]: calling them, elicitors, are they easily
accessible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty affordable as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, pretty affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all... So we use chemicals,
standard grade chemicals, because this was
[SPEAKER_00]: a scientific study, but these products are
available in the market to buy and apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are commercially available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually for this new round of
experiments we've got going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've asked my lab manager to try to get
the commercially available ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to make it as applicable to
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of practical advice to growers
who are concerned about HLBD, potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with HLBD, based on the studies
you've done and the research you've done,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are some sort of practical strategies
to prevent or eliminate an HLBD infection?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are finding that plant health really
is crucial in terms of our field
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment where we saw that healthy
plants were impossible to even get
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these elicitors that boosted...
Well, there were these trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping the plants healthy did see a
reduction in the beroid levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given that, now we know that these
insect pests are vectors, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring for both early symptoms of the
disease, because it just takes one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to serve as a host for secondary spread,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just quarantine it, but it may be
too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insects already have it and then they
are going around infecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think monitoring for insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have sticky trap, and we do this in
my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the bane of my lab, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never had this much quarantining and
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is in different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know growers are already doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your... Replace sticky cards
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And testing, testing, testing,
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I know is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually have a project underway to
develop some on-site field-based
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnostics, you know, because it's
getting...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even 24... What is it right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's $25 per sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so expensive and time-consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are some tests out there,
but we are trying to work something out
[SPEAKER_00]: with some collaborators at University of
Wisconsin, Madison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say monitoring, sanitation,
avoid cross-contamination and testing
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the research that I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope in the coming years, you know,
some of the things we've talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, they would be resistant
genotypes, varieties, and genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, USDA approved these transgenic
hemp, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think those are all possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to think about the sort of
social stigma of GMOs that still exist.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, interesting thing that
we're adding to this year's CanMed,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're having a whole genomics workshop all
about... Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a half-day workshop exploring
the use of genomics in breeding and in
[SPEAKER_01]: different applications for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be talking about,
you know, genetic engineering and GMOs and
[SPEAKER_01]: touching on those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's going to be a great
session to sort of have those
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations because it seems like that's
the way things are eventually going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I thought that I'm super excited
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Todd Michael is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this one, because it's so
resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all the, you know, throw the whole
kitchen sink approach for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and no, when you were talking about
plant health and it kind of just clicked
[SPEAKER_01]: in my head and, you know, as I understand
it, outdoor hemp is largely grown from
[SPEAKER_01]: seed, whereas indoor cannabis is largely
grown from clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always been the conversation
of, you know, growing from seed to have
[SPEAKER_01]: more vigor and are just more resilient
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if that could be,
you know, part of why you're seeing more
[SPEAKER_01]: resilience in the hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our field study, we had what we call
a dual-purpose grain fiber hemp variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was grown from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a high CBD line that was
clonally propagated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to do both, but it didn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the dual, the seed grown and the
clonally propagated high CBD line that we
[SPEAKER_00]: like to use in our lab did not have any
difference in the infection rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, this is just one clone,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's not the case in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's something there about
the plant health and the condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Punya, winding down here,
I did want to give you an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: share any other resources or links that
you think might be useful for anyone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: watching or listening, who wants to learn
more about this topic or your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please go ahead and share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my team is putting together a hemp
entomology website through my lab website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially a curation of all the
reliable resources for pests and diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: including some of our latest research.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we're planning to do is have a
newsletter to growers about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: both cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put that out to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Colorado Department of
Agriculture newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we get all the hemp registrants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love to reach the cannabis
industry so they can have more interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: with the university folks who are actually
doing this research with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the betterment of the growers,
for the scientific and intellectual merit
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we have, we are still finalizing
some aspects of this website, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially a way to just disseminate our
current knowledge, get it out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to send it to you and maybe
in this talk have it there so growers can
[SPEAKER_00]: sign up for all the news, latest research
in my lab and, you know, other
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators lab so they don't have to go
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are continuing to work on the virus
vector interaction, as I have already
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other interesting aspect is the seed
transmission, which is probably very
[SPEAKER_00]: surprising to everybody, right,
to find out that it's what 80 over 80%
[SPEAKER_00]: seed transmitted in hemp and not seed
transmitted in hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are trying to look into that and
understand the mechanism a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now, I don't think any of
the hemp is being, the seeds are being
[SPEAKER_00]: tested for, you know, certification or
what do you say, state to state
[SPEAKER_00]: transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could become a big issue if we don't
do anything proactively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, you said 80%?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it was stabbing in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think having certified seeds,
clean stocks, start clean would be the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the lines we used in my field
study, the high CBD that was clonally
[SPEAKER_00]: propagated came from a tissue culture lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew it did not have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with the seeds, we made sure we
tested to make sure that they were in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: negative, but not to say that there are
potentially hemp out there that has HIV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Punya, yes, please do share the link
to that site.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be happy to put it in the show
description so it's easy for folks to
[SPEAKER_01]: find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining us on the podcast
and sharing this information and giving us
[SPEAKER_01]: a nice preview of the information that
you'll be sharing at KMED25 down in Puerto
[SPEAKER_01]: Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can't wait to meet you in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, I really appreciate you putting
this podcast together and really helping
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers out, which is the bottom line,
right, for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks again, and we'll see you in
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
