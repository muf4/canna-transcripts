[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so today we're going to walk
through utilizing the Koji browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a genome browser where we have a
lot of ties in a canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of the data that was in this bio
archive pre-print we have over here is now
[SPEAKER_00]: up in viewable in Koji.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this consists of, well the paper had 42
genomes, there's now 47 genomes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: up in Koji and that number will keep
climbing, but these are whole genome shock
[SPEAKER_00]: guns done with Illumina all mapped to a
pack bio generated pan trio reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pan genome is just multiple genomes that
build a reference together and we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: maternal reference, a paternal reference
and an offspring reference all assembled
[SPEAKER_00]: with Pacific Biosciences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a long read sequencer that
generates reference grade genomes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: N50s of these genomes are very contiguous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most contiguous genomes that have been
put public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So N50 is the average size of the contigs
in the genome and the average for these
[SPEAKER_00]: are over a million bases or usually around
three million bases in length and that
[SPEAKER_00]: number goes a little bit further north if
you get rid of some of the small contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, the important thing to know
about these genomes is they have the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest BUSCO score out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: BUSCO is a tool that's utilized to measure
the completeness of genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that can be seen right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the mother father and the
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the N50 number, the average size,
the contig lengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is including a lot of small
contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to screen out the
things that are under 50 kb and these
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers climb a little bit, but we've left
them in there for completeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the genome sizes vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paternal genomes are bigger because
they have a Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a female and the BUSCO scores
is the percent completeness by looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: around 2,400 or so genes that should be in
all plant genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is approaching the highest we've
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we've ever seen this number
in assembly go higher than 97.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a reference that we're working on
right now that's a little bit different
[SPEAKER_00]: than these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, this is the set of
references we're using to map all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other 40 genomes against this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in addition to mapping those 40 whole
genome shotguns against this data set,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have done isoseq, which is single
molecule sequencing unpacked by all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA transcripts across five tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives us an idea of where all the
genes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we've got about 27,000
maternal genes and 32,000 paternal genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exome size is anywhere between 40 to
50 megabases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coding size is a little smarter than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CDS size is different than the exome
size because the exome can have the five
[SPEAKER_00]: prime and the three prime untranslated
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are UTRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make an RNA molecule,
you often include the promoter and the
[SPEAKER_00]: terminator in the RNA, which aren't
necessarily read into proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just used to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the exome includes the CDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CDS is always a subset of the exome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you look at how much genetic
distance these things span across,
[SPEAKER_00]: since genes can have large introns,
that means these are the gaps in between
[SPEAKER_00]: the expressed regions, or the exons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really spreads across 120 to 160
megabases in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of data in there to chew on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to share a couple other points of
this data set to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is a copy number map of all of
the other genomes that we sequenced
[SPEAKER_00]: against the Jamaican lion paternal
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This paternal reference has Y chromosomes
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's zero coverage over any
of those contigs in all of these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out those ones all happen to be
the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones we know are female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, these ones all happen to be the
females, and these ones happen to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: males, male, female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's coverage of those
regions in the males, and there isn't any
[SPEAKER_00]: of the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we identify the Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a little bit bigger than
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some portions of the Y chromosome
that are known as the pseudo-autosomal
[SPEAKER_00]: region, which is still recombining with
the Y, which means the portions of Y and X
[SPEAKER_00]: are still recombining, which means it
still has some homology to the X
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, you can see the females have
twice the amount of coverage on these
[SPEAKER_00]: contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're normally covered in the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the putative X chromosome material
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The X chromosome probably entails some of
these other areas as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually around over 100 megabases.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we add up everything that's going on
in the Y, the Y is the largest chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, so just a little bit larger than
X.
[SPEAKER_00]: That copy number map just helps you to
identify which ones are definitively male
[SPEAKER_00]: and female.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pedigree that was sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did pack biosequencing on this one,
this one, and this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a runt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not apparent at this stage in its
life, but you'll see some pictures for
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's actually a runt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chose that as the offspring of sequence
because we thought we might learn
[SPEAKER_00]: something about yield in that genome since
it seems to lack it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all the other ones we put through
Illumina sequencing and mapped it back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the maternal or paternal reference,
which you're going to see all of these BAM
[SPEAKER_00]: files in this COGI database.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of different aspects that you're
welcome to read in this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the single nucleotide
polymorphisms and the insertions and
[SPEAKER_00]: deletions under 50 bases that are found
across all of the 40 genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the type I's, the type II's,
and the type III's.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the pedigree plants up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jamaican lion family is in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's less variation amongst
their own family.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because we're mapping the family
back to its parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's less variance that way,
but as you begin to map hemp samples and
[SPEAKER_00]: other type I samples against these
genomes, you start to see much more
[SPEAKER_00]: diversion and diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see VCF files inside COGI that
I'm going to show you that describe some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a coverage correlation analysis of
the whole genome sequencing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note the scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very, very highly concordant
coverage across the genomes, but there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of genomes in here that are some of
the most diverged genomes we've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 83 set.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a unique set of plants,
minibusomes, and they may have some hops
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage to them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some really interesting
cross-breeding they've been trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: hops, but most of the sequence we're
seeing is predominantly cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can see is, of course,
the most divergent cannabis sequence we
[SPEAKER_00]: have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of ADE.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see its leaves look like basil,
not serrated, and it's powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its neighbors that are loaded with it
never seem to transfer it over to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also seen some of them Jamaican lion
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are powdery mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably have some pictures of that
that we can share as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is JL5, which turned into being a
hyper-branched runt when it came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown in the same conditions as all
its siblings, which are towering over it
[SPEAKER_00]: in this photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some interesting things that we
learned about what might be driving the
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of growth in that plant that you can
read about more in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're going to see are a variety of
heat maps that look like this throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are largely heat maps looking at
copy number changes of DNA in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we noticed in cannabis is that it
loves to insert and delete copies of
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this is how it did a cannabinoid
gene expansion in the plant, as it just
[SPEAKER_00]: kept making more copies of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's upwards to 90 of these
genes in the genome that have what looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like an FAD binding domain and a berberine
bridge, which is two of the
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of cannabinoid synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a PFAM domain that searches for
these in the genome, and that number ranks
[SPEAKER_00]: up there around 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, not all of those 90 years are active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are broken or truncated or
don't have the proper start and stop
[SPEAKER_00]: codons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've then filtered those for a smaller
set of genes that you'll see that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to touch on in some of these slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, you can do really
interesting studies when you have whole
[SPEAKER_00]: genome sequencing data with very few PCR
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an important aspect of doing the
method prep here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do that, you can then throw the
data up against the Jamaican line
[SPEAKER_00]: reference and ask which parts of the
genome are missing, which genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: missing, and which genes are amplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're looking at in this heat
map here, is that the genes that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: red have been amplified quite a bit,
and the genes that are blue have been
[SPEAKER_00]: deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see already just in these set of
samples here that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic of certain TLPs being
deleted and certain chitinases and MLO
[SPEAKER_00]: regions being amplified, and also some
chitinases that have been perhaps deleted
[SPEAKER_00]: or amplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've been doing is tracking powdery
mildew resistance status across multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars to see if any of these patterns
map with resistance status.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we're looking at chitinases and
thalmatine-like proteins and MLO is these
[SPEAKER_00]: are all the genes and hops that have been
hunted down over the years to be involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in powdery mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have a few candidates in here,
genes that we believe are involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew resistance in Jamaican
lion, and we've cloned those and expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: them and demonstrated they actually
destroy fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that being said, while we think we
have found a reason for powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance in Jamaican lion, we believe
there's going to be convergent evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's this many chitinases and this
many TLPs, other plants are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: probably find a collection of these things
to amplify that give them resistance as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, but may not show the same pattern
that we see in the Jamaican lion genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple ways to probably skin the
resistance cat, and while we think we
[SPEAKER_00]: found one of them, probably may not be
100% reflective of resistance in other
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a set that we pulled out that we
believe are playing a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've cloned a few of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this TLP 2563 has in fact been
cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that work in this paper that
when it is cloned, expressed in a coli,
[SPEAKER_00]: and purified out of a coli, and then
placed onto films that are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: penicillium and fusarium, we get this type
of inhibition and growth when these
[SPEAKER_00]: chitinases and TLPs are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a fusarium oxysporum, and it's got
less growth over here where we've applied
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the enzyme, then we'll put down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to change the autofusarium
expression in fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, fusarium is known that when you give
it mycosides, it stops making these
[SPEAKER_00]: pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sign of it going into apoptosis and
cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to read about this in this
paper, but if you really want to dig
[SPEAKER_00]: through this data, you want to get
familiar with COGI, which is the genome
[SPEAKER_00]: browser that allows you to surf all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we left off the last tutorial talking
about CBD and THC genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is a heat map looking at those
three genes that we scan in canapedia,
[SPEAKER_00]: the inactive CBD synthase, the active CBD
synthase, and the active CBD synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this type of pattern here that
is inversely correlated and predicts the
[SPEAKER_00]: typing of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type 1, 2, and 3 status is completely
predictable by the presence and absence of
[SPEAKER_00]: these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice this region is almost always
correlated, maybe not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit difference,
but the deletion sometimes extends to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit shorter, a little bit longer in
this region of the genome, and we get more
[SPEAKER_00]: or less a very similar prediction with the
gene even right next door to THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I mentioned in the last tutorial,
there's many other ways to knock out THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen some type 4 plants that have
this gene in red, making you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a type 1, 2, and plant, but it
actually has some point mutations that
[SPEAKER_00]: knock out really key amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show you how you can take your
VCF file from StrainSeq, load it into
[SPEAKER_00]: Koji, and look for those things because
right now, the tools we have in the
[SPEAKER_00]: reports aren't digging that deep yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data is there in your sequencing data,
but our software tools haven't gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: smart enough to go in there and identify
the variants and decide which one's really
[SPEAKER_00]: damaging and which one isn't to give you a
23andMe report on every single base.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're building that right now,
but in the meantime, we want to enable you
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to load this stuff into the
Koji genome browser and surf it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a sense of the complexity
that's behind this, these are a very large
[SPEAKER_00]: set of cannabinoid synthase genes,
39 of them with 11 other genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: next door neighbors to them that
oftentimes disappear or appear with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in linkage.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these genes get deleted, they
sometimes delete their neighbors too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to track because if you
breed for certain cannabinoid synthase
[SPEAKER_00]: genes to be present or absent in your
plants, you really keep track of the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors that's dragging down with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a case here where these sets of
genes, this is a gene on contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks at contigs 756, right there,
C756.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cannabichromine cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's labeled as inactive THC synthase
because that's what NCBI first learned of
[SPEAKER_00]: this as.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was submitted as an inactive THC
synthase, meaning it makes very little or
[SPEAKER_00]: no THC synthase, but it might make some.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to keep your eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now been cloned and it's known to be
the cannabichromine synthase cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that many of the lines have
copies of this, particularly some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: ones are, in fact, hemp lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you breed for hemp lines,
you've got to make sure that if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp line that still has eight of these
inactive THC synthases, they may cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may leak on you and still be slightly
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers right now want to breed
hemp lines that have this two megabase
[SPEAKER_00]: deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a common deletion in the
population where this whole cassette is
[SPEAKER_00]: knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also happens to knock out these other
genes on contigs 756 down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our paper describes these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These other genes here are, in fact,
pathogen resistance genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're aquaporin receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are gibberillin receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're important features that go with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be careful and look at your
plant to know if you are breeding for one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these things, you might want to pick
one that doesn't have as many of those
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen resistant genes knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here, Tibor, still has many of
those pathogen resistance genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't have the inactive THC
synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabichromines are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great line to perhaps try and
breed into a type 3 compliant hemp line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not make a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may need to be paired with something
that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see several type 1 plants
often have the cannabichromine cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would really never know if they're
making residual THC because you already
[SPEAKER_00]: have a THC synthase and they're making
plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see a lot of plants that don't
have the THC synthase gene, do have a CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase gene, but also have
cannabichromine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a problem, as we mentioned in
our last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there's a lot of cannabichromine
genes to keep in mind as you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: these things and breeding because
ultimately these are going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: source of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Residual cannabinoid expression is not
just related to the major genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these old genes might be producing
other cannabinoids, rare ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: or small amounts of THC and CBD synthase,
which could wreak havoc in a hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to find this paper at Bioarchive
and let's go to Koji.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you Google Koji, COGE, comparative
genomics, you'll end up at a site like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a tutorial here, but I'm going to
try and do that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of genomes in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see there's 51,000 genomes in this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There happens to be a lot of our cannabis
genomes in here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search for cannabis genomes,
you're going to get a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to click on the one in here
that's certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right down here, there's a Jamaican lion
mother that's been certified and there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a male that's been certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: The certification just means that the Koji
team has combed over the annotations in
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome structure and they believe it
meets a certain standard and they
[SPEAKER_00]: certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the best Busco score and N50
genomes out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will know we have not put them into
chromosomes yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we are playing with that,
we're cautious on calling the chromosomes
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're all very similar sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we just showed you, there are frequent
two megabase deletions that may make you
[SPEAKER_00]: miscall chromosome five versus chromosome
six because these things are really close
[SPEAKER_00]: in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's a two meg deletion there,
you can quickly make chromosome six,
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake it for chromosome five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying they're on five or six.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example, a lot of these chromosomes
are almost identical in size and so the
[SPEAKER_00]: deletions matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see chromosomes from us a little
bit later this year but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: that level of resolution is a little bit
academic at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's open up one of these browsers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now into this genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will show you there's a couple
different annotations that we've thrown in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also give you a handful of
experiments that are public and available
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to surf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to download this genome,
right there is a download button.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a GFF download in here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had some people report that
downloading from GFS from Koji changes the
[SPEAKER_00]: format a little bit so just be aware of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two different ways to download
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's through this tab and one other tab
that when you click on the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment itself, I think when you
download that, you get the exact file we
[SPEAKER_00]: put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you download off of this, there might
be some modifications that Koji added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different ways to download those,
just be aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go browse this genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to bring up what's known as
a genome browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it's going to ask you for are,
what coordinates do you want to go to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What part of the map are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the last thing we looked
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just go over to let's go to THC
synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everyone loves to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: 741, I happen to know this is at 441700.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows you the ATCs and Gs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar with this,
this is an amino acid translation in three
[SPEAKER_00]: different frames in the top strand and
three different frames in the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read three different frames of DNA
when you're trying to convert it into
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: These red marks are stop codons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually genes don't have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to know what frame you're in is
just look for the longest stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't have any stop codons.
[SPEAKER_00]: With THC synthase, it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a finding right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go further back to the start of the
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's zoom out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going baby steps anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start of the gene, stop of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on this, you'll get a little
messenger RNA with a note of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: database thinks this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some annotation on this and
adjusted some of the start and stop codons
[SPEAKER_00]: just to make sure that it's in fact what
is seen in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can download the sequence of it by
hitting that fast A button if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this is what we use to clone some
of those powdery mildew resistance genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just clicked on the gene, grabbed this
from the start codon on, sent it off to
[SPEAKER_00]: Genscript to get it cloned and sequenced
and expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had protein in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking at here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, as I said, the coding sequence,
CDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to add more features in here,
you can easily take that CDS and it'll add
[SPEAKER_00]: it down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remove that track if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remove that track if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it back, it'll end up down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can also see that we have all of
these other reads here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is female leaf RNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did ISO-seq sequencing,
all of these RNA molecules popped out from
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves that we're expressing to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's to be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a type two plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below here is a whole genome shotgun of
grape stomper, another genome that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: aligned to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can comb through this and look for
variants if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that out of here because it
takes up a lot of memory and work with
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's TSC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, other things you might want to look
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you had your own sample,
you could load that into the genome
[SPEAKER_00]: browser, a VCF file off a canapedia,
and see where all the SNPs are in your
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do that in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just show you some of the
functionality here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the public data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hit the structural variation file
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show you where are the very large
scale insertions and deletions are on the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're going to find any in
Jamaican lion or over TSC synthase,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you may find some other hits over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows you its size and some of its
attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's go into TSC synthase and let's
ask ourselves, well, what do we have in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 40 Genomes project in terms of a VCF
file?
[SPEAKER_00]: VCF files are variant call formats and
they'll have some of the SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if that peppers this with
variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There must be another one up here that
does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 40 Genomes thing public.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's annotations in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may give you some of the gene calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some work from a group,
I think 20 labs that did some mass spec
[SPEAKER_00]: profiling and you can see how many of
these genes have they actually detected a
[SPEAKER_00]: mass spec peptide for.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, TSC synthase pops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in our experience, 98.8% of what Ben
Osborne has found and has published we
[SPEAKER_00]: find in the RNA set in Jamaican lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found about 12,000 peptides and you saw
from our slides over there that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: like 27 to 32,000 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only about 40% of the RNA that we have
found is accounted for in the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not unheard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the proteins may not be heavily
expressed and the sensitivity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: machine may not pick them up otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a variety of experiments here you
can throw on top of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the RNA from the female flowers,
from the leaves, from the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's not a lot of THC
synthase expressed in the roots as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just get more room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing from the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeded female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, RNA went down a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to be surprised once you start putting
seeds out, you can see the expression goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down on THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's male flowers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male flowers aren't making a whole lot
of THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we have in here are BAM
files.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are binary after mapping files of
about 50 or so strain seek samples that
[SPEAKER_00]: are public in Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at Queen Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Queen Jesus actually is not a vet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's a type 3 plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Santhaca is a type 4 plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't going to have a lot of
sequence over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit something as a type 1 so you can
see what the sequence looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Serious Happiness will be a type 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's some reeds that are
covering this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we zoom in on those reeds, you can see
there's sequence coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a region of THC synthase that is
a little bit tricky to cover because it
[SPEAKER_00]: has homology to a lot of other cannabinoid
synthase genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to place reeds in some portions
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the coverage might just be a
little light there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we get another one that's got
a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This region's all tiled, but there's
sometimes some lack of reeds there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pull up... Maybe Liberty Haze will
have some depth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to something like Carmagnolia,
I'm going to bet you won't see any reeds
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is a type 3 plant and it is
deleted in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the underlying data that's behind
the plots in Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we did something like put a whole
genome shotgun across this, I think what
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find... These are whole genome
shotguns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find a whole genome shotgun that's a
type 1 and see what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reeds tiled all the way across the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a whole genome shotgun takes the
whole genome and sequences it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to try to fish THC synthase
out of the genome to get coverage over it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a hybridization capture system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just sequence everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more expensive, but it's a lot
more thorough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will miss less SNPs as a result of
this, particularly in genes that have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of homology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can load up all different types of
samples here and look for variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about looking at variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you want to look at variants,
we probably want to look at a VCF file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we're looking at your VCF file,
I'm getting a little more serious here and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting on a professional look.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all seriousness, what we need to do in
Koji is to actually load up your VCF file.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a Cyverse account in
order to load data into Koji, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw out an email address, you'll get a
Koji account in a day, and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: upload your own data to this browser and
overlay it with all the data that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you do that is you go over here to
Experiments, you click New, you click New
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment or Load EXP, and this should
bring up a window that allows us to load
[SPEAKER_00]: up a file.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hit the Upload button here
and choose a file.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to pick your VCF file.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these can be a little big sometimes,
so let's just see how well it soaks this
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in that range right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this realizes this is the VCF file,
you hit Next, fill out some meta
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I already have a version of this
running that we can skip to while that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you'll ultimately receive
when you're done loading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the file's been loaded up,
you'll have all this information,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will collect some of the metadata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the metadata it asked for,
you can see in the background here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it asked for a name, you could put a
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't put much in because it's just a
test, a version, the site that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: generated to, whether it's restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left it as private right here,
so you can load your data in and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: view it against all the data we have in
our database privately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to put any of your findings
public in this regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see here, this is an important
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bounced over to this step here to
make sure that's a VCF file.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of files you can upload,
but you want to make sure you call it what
[SPEAKER_00]: this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go next, it'll ask, I haven't
really used these features yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will send you an email when it's
done, but it only takes a few minutes for
[SPEAKER_00]: a VCF file.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more important for BAM files,
it can take an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's notebook features in here that
I've not yet explored.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hit Next here, it's going to
start uploading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to actually cancel out of
this because we've already done that
[SPEAKER_00]: section over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just hit OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we have that loaded up,
what we can do is look for it in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the data that's up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to search for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go, right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the VCF file we loaded up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hit View Data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can even make it public just like that,
real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit Browse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will probably load up the genome with
this VCF file layered against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's a variant call format.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just means every line is a list of a
coordinate of the genome with a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: base change and some quality information
about that base change.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, how many reads are
contributing to that base change.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're zoomed really far out like
this, you start to get a density plot of
[SPEAKER_00]: where all the polymorphisms are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's go again to our favorite gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you don't recall 4417,
I have that burned in my brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't have to have it burned into
your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just go up here and say,
I like THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Touch a hydro and search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I forgot to check all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hit OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will come up with a list of all the
different THC-like genes in the contig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bet that one's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that is the active THC
synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of remember that by the
coordinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some of this in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see what the genes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feature CDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coding sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squish that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoom this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing here are different
variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: CDT variant at this coordinate near THC
synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see another one over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, if you zoom out a lot in this,
you'll see many, many more SNFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of those is a variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's how you load your
data into Koji.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's ways to load fast cues in here
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very helpful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to search around the genome
and look for particular key genes by
[SPEAKER_00]: looking through this feature function.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some other comparative
genomic tools in here that people should
[SPEAKER_00]: know about if you were to actually go
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a tutorial on how to use
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to point you to the tutorial
because that's probably a better way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other comparative genomic
tools in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given this is the comparative genomics
genome browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go up to, I think, tools up here,
you'll see those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like SynMap is a very good tool to do
genome to genome alignments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, let's do one right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take SynMap and align.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it will only do alignments of genomes
that have annotations on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very few of them have annotations
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's SynMap 3D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do three dimensional
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_00]: SynMap 2, we're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just go here and go cannabis,
it's going to bring you up a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different versions of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's take Jamaican lion as organism
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's do the same over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: No coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBDRX has annotations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Kush does not have annotations yet,
although they're in NCBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not have annotations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that one does now.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put on CBDRX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generate SynMap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is going to run a program in the
background, and it will get back to you
[SPEAKER_00]: the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that probably doesn't look very good
to anyone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some features in here that
will make this compare them
[SPEAKER_00]: in a more meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want this at 24 and 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the most important feature,
it only had telochromosomes, or 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do some KNKS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give that a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've run an analysis on here,
it will remember that and only run the
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of your analysis that's needed,
like this dagchainer right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's been run before and you happen to
compare the same genomes side by side,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll just recall the old time that you
ran that it has a running memory of the
[SPEAKER_00]: analyses that you've run in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you change any one of these
numbers, it's going to have to rerun it.
That
[SPEAKER_00]: will take a little time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close out of some of these now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may have to come back to that at a
later time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this usually gives you some dot plots
comparing one genome to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see some of these in our
manuscript, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have to wait for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're actually in one of our figures
where you can see a Jamaican line lined up
[SPEAKER_00]: to CBDRX.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gives you an understanding of
which contigs in our genome are the
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponding contigs in their genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually gives you an Excel file
that you can use to download if you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do comparative genomics between
two different genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of good tools in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll leave it at that and probably
put in another tutorial on some other
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality on this as video three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
