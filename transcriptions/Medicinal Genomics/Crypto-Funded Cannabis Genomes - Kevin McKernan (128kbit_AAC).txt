[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm paranoid of the voice of God,
so I'm going to be dashing through this
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, if you haven't quite captured
the power of cryptocurrency, hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: this project will sum it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think it's used for
nefarious uses, but actually they're now
[SPEAKER_00]: funding scientific purposes, scientific
projects, they're funding charities all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world, and Dash decided back in
the springtime to fund this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is this project about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, John gave a great description of
what you can do with the current genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you look around other plant
genomes that have much smaller economic
[SPEAKER_00]: impact than cannabis, their genomes are in
much better shape than ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis genome right now is in
horrible shape compared to these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does create some artifacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Philippe showed some artifacts where you
try and replicate markers and the primers
[SPEAKER_00]: fall on snips and it doesn't reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen this with a lot of the
vendors supplying sequencing services as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that the things just don't fully
reproduce lab to lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to change that is to
actually sequence the genome to a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of at least what the Human Genome Project
had back in 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the metric back then was to get to
about 500 kb and 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is the average length of
the sequence contig in the assembly was
[SPEAKER_00]: about 500,000 letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want chromosomes that are hundreds of
millions of bases long that are completely
[SPEAKER_00]: contiguous and completely phased,
but this is the best we could do back
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I think you'll find the hurdle
rate for a good genome, people will say,
[SPEAKER_00]: is if you're in the megabase club,
they want this N50 number to be north of a
[SPEAKER_00]: million bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show you how we pulled
this off on the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several reasons to do this
that John touched on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want marker-assisted selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want accelerated breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want reliable snip chips, which I don't
think you can get off the existing
[SPEAKER_00]: references.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to do this on as many genomes
as possible, not just any one sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: victory genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a hand genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want type 1 genomes, type 2 genomes,
type 3 genomes, type 4, type 5,
[SPEAKER_00]: you name it, hemplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want 12 really powerfully done
genomes to make sense of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some terminology here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably used to hearing about
contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what a normal assembly turns into,
a couple hundred thousand of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really want to get into chromosomes
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's technologies from phased
genomics and packed bio that help do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'll touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is really important for you to
understand where those chromosomes came
[SPEAKER_00]: from, like if they're in certain
organelles or if they're in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that often contaminate genome
assemblies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started off sequencing a Jamaican
lion strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a strain that I selected
mainly because it had some impact on my
[SPEAKER_00]: father.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was using type 2 strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was also some controversy over
IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we figured, let's see if we can shed
some light on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also like teasing Mark Lewis once in
a while and trolling him a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided, hey, let's sequence
something that he may have bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this actually dates back to 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some awards that we won,
and it is a type 2 plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks as if it is beta caroethylene
dominant, a little bit immersing in there
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These might vary based on conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all grown in a hydro to get rid of
microbes, or at least to limit the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the reports down here in
terms of the, it's about a 2 to 1 CBD to
[SPEAKER_00]: THC line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, DASH, as Chuck just described,
consists of these masternode owners that
[SPEAKER_00]: are all over the world that vote on how to
spend their treasury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you submit them proposals,
and they decide, will this help us improve
[SPEAKER_00]: our network?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're interested in solving the
banking problem in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they saw this conference, and they saw
this genome, and said, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's build the best reference in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can maybe even build a seed to
sale tracking system that is forensic in
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they voted on this in June 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what's crazy about the process
is you submit the grant application.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably submitted it a week before the
deadline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by a week later, we had DASH in our
bank ready to spend, and we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: kick the project off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: June 3, we started UPCR screening for type
2 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little color metric assay we
have that can tell you whether it's type
[SPEAKER_00]: 1, 2, or 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then went into Illumina sequencing to
screen for heterozygosity to pick a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that had the less of that, because that
would be better to sequence as a first
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got to go back to these old
school tools of actually doing pulse field
[SPEAKER_00]: gel electrophoresis to get high molecular
weight DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get DNA as long as possible,
because the read lengths we have now in
[SPEAKER_00]: these single molecule sequencers can
actually get out to 50 to 100,000 bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we chose to do this on the Pacific
Biosciences platform, because it had the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other nanopores out there
that have longer reads, but the accuracy
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, when we played around with that
last year at CAMiD, we couldn't get those
[SPEAKER_00]: assemblies to gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we turned back to PacBio and looked for
higher accuracy reads and fed it DNA that
[SPEAKER_00]: could actually get us these 32,000 base
pair reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we assembled this by August 3 and put
it public at about a 600 and 50 KB and 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we beat the Human Genome Project draft,
I should say, in a matter of a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: months, 60 days, from getting funded to
putting it public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't the end of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then decided to team up with Phase
Genomics to turn this thing into a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfection genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what these folks do is they use
something called chromatin capture,
[SPEAKER_00]: which basically cross-links the proteins
that are attached to the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tends to mostly do that to
interchromosomalase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't get chromosome-to-chromosome
cross-links as much as you get neighboring
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA cross-links.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you can get from this
technology are pieces of DNA sequence that
[SPEAKER_00]: are millions of bases apart, but are on
the same chromosome, and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: order up all your chromosomes into pretty
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did 600 million high C reads like
this on Illumina to get the high C data
[SPEAKER_00]: together, threw it into an assembly,
and we ended up with a 5.4 megabase N50
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still not perfect, but, you know,
we're up above the megabase club.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we realized, you know what,
we really want to get this into,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, a 50 megabase range so that we have
full chromosomes that are touching and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can phase the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back and did more pack
biosequencing on their latest chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a version 6 chemistry that does
42,000 base pair reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it can do longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably limited in the type and
the quality of DNA we gave them and gave
[SPEAKER_00]: the laboratory that was doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need to get that DNA as long as
you can so that you can maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: throughput on these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this went into another assembly,
a Falcon assembly, and this raw assembly
[SPEAKER_00]: unscaffolded without any of the high C
data trying to glue the contigs together
[SPEAKER_00]: came out at three times this one megabase
club, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 3.7 megabases of just the pack
biodata alone, and that is fantastic to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you some perspective on where that is
in a slider to a she where all the
[SPEAKER_00]: historical assemblies were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we quickly uploaded
this into a preprint server because our
[SPEAKER_00]: funding cycle was ending by the end of
October, and we really wanted to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: chapter closed on starting a funding to
end a funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a preprint out that
represents all this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are these platforms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah gave a great talk in the other
hallway on what Pacific Biosciences is.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are single molecule sequencers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that trace you see up there is actually
a single molecule going through a zero
[SPEAKER_00]: mode waveguide with a polymerase that's
putting in fluorescently labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotides, and you are watching a movie
of a polymerase replicating DNA at a
[SPEAKER_00]: single molecule level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely mind-blowing Star Trek
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can do millions of these wells at
a time, which is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one is this Hi-C
approach that phase genomics was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this does is it really gives you
three-dimensional structures of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome, because their genome is not these
perfect, beautiful linear chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a big Gordian knot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you cross-link that, you end up
cross-linking certain DNA into certain
[SPEAKER_00]: compartments of cells, like the
mitochondrial DNA ends up in one place and
[SPEAKER_00]: the chloroplast ends up in another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of the microbial
contaminations end up cross-linked in
[SPEAKER_00]: their own buckets because they have
nucleuses and other cell walls that are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of constraining them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this helps partition cells into the
buckets that the DNA actually exists in
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the cell, so you can do much more
complete and thorough assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the first ones that we
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the most remarkable thing
about this technique is that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need high molecular weight DNA to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the tissue, and you just
cross-link it with formaldehyde.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you chop the DNA up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's cross-linked, these huge loops
of megabases apart get cut, and you ligate
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and you're effectively reading the
ends of these large loops of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up building these maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the map that you have here is a
contact map.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the earliest ones that we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, you want to see a really
bright line in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not completely getting that yet
with cannabis because of the repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: content in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is bucketing now into 10 nice
chromosomes, which is what we want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see chromosome one through
chromosome all the way through the X and Y
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to see two of them because the
cannabis is diploid most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the next phase that we have to
do, no pun intended, is we have to then
[SPEAKER_00]: take this diploid genome and split it into
the two maternal and paternal chromosomes
[SPEAKER_00]: for every one of them and then organize
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just put the brakes on here and look at
what types of assemblies we traditionally
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in 2001, John's group and our
group played around with assembling some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these genomes with Illumina data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they ended up in hundreds of thousands
of pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average contig size was around
3,000 bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very small contig size when you
consider the human genome declared victory
[SPEAKER_00]: on a draft at 500,000 bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then many other people started
shipping in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Hill put out a really nice assembly
that then bumped this number up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, Phylos put one in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the N50 number got up to 159
kb.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the longest, most contiguous
assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was on Kanatonic, which was a type
3 strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't getting much information out
of the THC genetics from that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was still giving us great insight
into maybe the CBD genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we jumped on to Jamaican Lion and
started pumping these numbers up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 and 48 region and the 665 region with
just the packed bio assembly alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we topped this off with
version 6 chemistry, these numbers all
[SPEAKER_00]: jumped to 3.7 megabase N50 results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really talking about thousands of
fold improvement over contiguity from
[SPEAKER_00]: where we started in 2011 to what we have
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very fast response working with
cryptocurrency folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move very quickly, and it really
helps to get the data out there publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did play around with trying to figure
out some aspects of this genome with the
[SPEAKER_00]: existing assemblies we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published a pre-print that we never
really converted into a paper because it
[SPEAKER_00]: just opened up this onion of confusion
once we did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did PCR amplification of THC synthase
with two different primer sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some primer sets that were described
in the literature from a group from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Anofre paper were sitting right inside the
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they amplified this, the primers
were sitting on the start and stop code.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a little bit blind to the
variation in the start and the stop
[SPEAKER_00]: codons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to mean something in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see when we amplify with those
Anofre primers, we amplify a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know where they are in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just amplify them and sequence them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that they're unique copies
because they have high confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: polymorphisms between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know the order of them in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know where they go in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't necessarily know if they're
fully active in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just saw there's a lot of those copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then backed those primers out to
amplify with more unique regions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome, and we started getting much fewer
genes that were coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that were coming through
seemed to all be full length.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't any stop codons in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked as if they were really
good THC synthase contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you get a good genome reference,
this is what happens is they all show up
[SPEAKER_00]: in a tandem array.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interestingly enough, THC synthase has
replicated itself almost like it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: skidded across the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's one region and one contig
that has five different copies of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase, but they're all mutated
substantially.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I don't even know if we want to
call some of these THC synthase because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably only 85% identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then likewise, you can look at another
contig that is the one that contains
[SPEAKER_00]: kinabacromine synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know that this thing actually is
four tandem copies, about 30 or 40 kb
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably can't see this,
but there are some mutations in the three
[SPEAKER_00]: prime end and the five prime end that
change the amino acid structure such that
[SPEAKER_00]: primers probably missed this in the past
because they would have been placed on
[SPEAKER_00]: those sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: There happens to be two more copies of
this in another contig in the genome
[SPEAKER_00]: that's now been leaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's actually six copies of this
thing, and they're all slightly diverged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know if they fold at the same
rate or if they maybe fold some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other rare cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These need to be cloned and expressed,
and a lot of the work that John's done on
[SPEAKER_00]: this gene needs to be repeated with maybe
some of these variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how many we're finding that have
at least 80% identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 30 different DNA sequences,
and this is a cladogram of them and the
[SPEAKER_00]: scaffolds that they're sitting on in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see there's a lot of cannabinoid
diversity, cannabinoid synthase diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you kind of whittle those down
and say, well, which ones are really full
[SPEAKER_00]: length and possibly functional?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of these are so mutated,
maybe they're just pseudogenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get down to about 18 of these
different THC synthase genes that look
[SPEAKER_00]: like they possibly could actually encode
for something that's full length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be teaming up with people that
can probably clone these, express them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get more information on their
functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in terms of assay development,
as Philippe was touching on, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we were dealing with before, is that this
is a mapping to the references that were
[SPEAKER_00]: made back in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not careful when you map to
these genomes, these blue reads are paired
[SPEAKER_00]: reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they're Illumina reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a forward and reverse read,
and they both map to the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing highlights it blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red and green are ones where we can only
map one of the reads to the genome and not
[SPEAKER_00]: the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ones you should always kind of
discount as to whether or not you should
[SPEAKER_00]: trust them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even with these blue ones,
you can see paired reads, there are four
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs in here that probably don't really
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is, when you map these same
reads to Jamaican lion, you see that those
[SPEAKER_00]: reads then map to those other genes that
we just found that are tandem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it cleans up a lot of your mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cleans up a lot of your polymorphism
discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a reference where we can
actually maybe go ahead and make a SNP
[SPEAKER_00]: chip out of this and not be confusing all
of the signals that we might get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the chip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phased genomics then stepped into this
to try and phase the genome, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: using this Hi-C stuff to peel apart the
maternal and paternal haplotype so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can have a perfectly phased genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they run this through a busco
analysis, it looks at how many pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up in the 800 range there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the N50 numbers are
getting closer to 5.4 megabases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more complete genome is a little bit
more AT-rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to go into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are publishing this on Dash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is we're using an
incentivized review system to speed it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We select three reviewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We end up putting out a cryptocurrency
bounty for doing the review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every communication they do ends up
getting hashed onto the blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's completely censorship resistant
and transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the phasing stuff is tough,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what a typical genome should look
like is it should have two different
[SPEAKER_00]: copies of this genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what typically happens is genomes
get collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're really homozygous, like humans,
they get collapsed into one copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't discern the maternal from the
paternal because there's only a SNP every
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 bases or every 1,000 bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to tease those apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do this with a program called
purge haplotigs, which looks for coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: differences among the contigs,
rips the ones that are high out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can begin to zip these things
into even better maps than we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you add in bigger data from PacBio,
these things turn into this mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is actually not a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a mess to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what actually we're seeing here is the
numbers that popped out of this were 75
[SPEAKER_00]: megabase N50 contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means we have perfect coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a lot of chromosomes that are
all sorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there might be a couple of gaps in
between the scaffolding from high sea,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we can fill with a couple other
programs that they're recommending,
[SPEAKER_00]: like PolarStar and another tool that helps
to connect those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called PB Jelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in that process right now to
just now polish these things and fill the
[SPEAKER_00]: gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's safe to say that we now
have a genome that is better than most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other agricultural crops out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just more statistics I won't
bore you with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what the future is going to hold is we
have a cross of this going on so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get a trio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with its brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're going to do in the future
is a lot more methylation sequence,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more RNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to do some more trio work
and maybe build some really powerful SNP
[SPEAKER_00]: chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank all these people
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of volunteers that jumped
into this project and made this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should leave some time for a
question or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please come up to the mics and ask any
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot for the talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned the repeats on the THC and
the cannabinoid synthase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you probably saw a lot on
terpene synthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you comment a little bit on the
organization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done a little bit of looking into
the terpene synthase genes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, Luca and Keith Allen at
Steep Hill have been digging into that a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got kind of a little community here
that I know that you're involved with that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're staring out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they're remapping all of John's RNA
sequencing data onto the new assemblies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the terpene synthase cluster is even
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many more of those to work
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of new to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this mean anything of value can be
sold or distributed to anybody or
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you referring to the blockchain side
of this or the cannabis sequencing side of
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have a photograph of Jimi Hendrix,
does that mean it can be somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: quantified into some massive distribution?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are things going on on the
Ethereum network where people will get art
[SPEAKER_00]: and hash it onto Ethereum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get certain number of digital
copies that are verifiable so that that
[SPEAKER_00]: art is effectively scarce digitally,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some unique attributes to the
music industry that that plays a role in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I'm getting the god light
coming up on me over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think with this, we're going to turn
this over into more Q&A with the panel to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to invite all of our
panelists up for this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
