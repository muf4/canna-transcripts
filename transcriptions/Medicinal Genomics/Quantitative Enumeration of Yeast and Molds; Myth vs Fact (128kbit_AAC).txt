[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Ben Amaraltz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics, and I'll be your moderator for
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, thank you for joining us to discuss
the facts and myths around quantitative
[SPEAKER_01]: enumeration of yeast and mold on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of confusion and
misinformation on the topic that we hear
[SPEAKER_01]: from customers and our customers'
customers, regulators, really everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought the best way to address it
would be to lay it all out in the webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having said that, we're going to cover a
lot of ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not as familiar with
microbiology or molecular methods like
[SPEAKER_01]: QPCR, it may seem like a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we invite you to submit questions
throughout the presentation, and we'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: our best here to address them either in
the chat or in the Q&A session following
[SPEAKER_01]: the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do that, click the Q&A icon in the
bottom of your screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will open up a chat window where you
can submit your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we don't have time to get to your
question, we'll follow up via email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if you think of a question
after the webinar, you can email us at
[SPEAKER_01]: info at medicinalgenomics.com,
and we can respond to you that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this webinar is being recorded,
and it will be available on our website
[SPEAKER_01]: later this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need to jump off, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll email each of you when the recording
is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I'd like to introduce today's
presenter, CSO and founder, of medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics, Kevin McKernan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin is a pioneer in the genomics of
cannabis and hemp, dedicated to building a
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger scientific environment for the
study of cannabis-based therapeutics,
[SPEAKER_01]: product safety, and blockchain
technologies for tracking and verifying
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take it away, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to cover some ground here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important in doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lay out some conflicts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're obviously a manufacturer in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make PCR kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see a pretty PCR-heavy
presentation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some other conflicts that
are worth also putting on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certainly many different
business interests in testing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have many of the growers who are very
interested in getting reproducible testing
[SPEAKER_00]: from labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want there to be a fairly open
and free market there so they can trust
[SPEAKER_00]: any lab and get the same answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also been a concern that lab
shopping can influence the marketplace,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that growers may be interested perhaps
in lower fail rates so they can get more
[SPEAKER_00]: volume through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes those financial interests
may not always be in line with the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from our experience working a lot
of testing labs, they're most interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in reproducibility, in accuracy,
and in scalability, which are three topics
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think are going to fit well with
the PCR theme that we speak about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are regulators who are
interested in addressing many of these
[SPEAKER_00]: conflicts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have business motivations,
and their interest is to look out for the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient who may not be reflected in some
of the conflicts that are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that backdrop, I want to encourage
everyone who's listening to us to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: real firm look at how the language of
regulation is being written.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very different in each
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the one confounding term that
is haunting the entire field and holding
[SPEAKER_00]: us back is this reliance on a
colony-forming unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not a very specific term,
and it's a term you can drive a truck
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, this is going to induce a
tremendous amount of lab shopping and
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments over who's right and who's
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think when you boil this down to a
DNA level, a lot of those problems
[SPEAKER_00]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I've made such an outrageous
statement, I should back it up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit with some of our history in this field
and let you know that we're not quacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually been doing a lot of DNA
sequencing and managing of E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli in bacteria cultures for a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the field for over 25 years,
and I helped Eric Lander construct this
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing pipe, one of the Human Genome
Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I managed his research and development
group there, and we built this pipeline to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage and culture 10 or 20 million
different E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli cultures in 10 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was used to sequence the DNA out
of those E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli and do it quite effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we became very aware of how to
quantitate these organisms, how to lice
[SPEAKER_00]: open these organisms, and how to read DNA
out of these organisms in a manner which
[SPEAKER_00]: is very reflective of their reproductive
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this technology was then
distilled into a startup company called
[SPEAKER_00]: Agincourt Biosciences, which became the
largest commercial sequencing vendor in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world back in 2000 to 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also developed these DNA purification
tools, which you're seeing at this lower
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of these beads down in the lower
right-hand corner of the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the more popular DNA
purification systems now in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen reports that suggest that up to
80% of the market of next-generation
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing is running off of something
known as Ampure, which is a DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: purification system that we developed
there at Agincourt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beckman Coulter acquired that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know what to do with one of
our SkunkWork projects, so they decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: spin that out and fund it with $6 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had another $6 million from NHGRI,
and we built the DNA sequencer that is
[SPEAKER_00]: showcased here on science, the cover of
science translational medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a solid sequencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: ABI came to acquire that technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ended up commercializing it and
capturing 35% of the market share by 2008,
[SPEAKER_00]: next to Illumina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the company was eventually acquired by
Life Technologies, largely justified on
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating the solid sequencer into
LifeTech's portfolio.
[SPEAKER_00]: This system utilized massively parallel
PCR of single molecules, so you had to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very cautious when amplifying single
molecules billions and billions of times,
[SPEAKER_00]: such that your primers didn't misreact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually going to play a role
in some of the story we speak about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this, this system was getting
utilized for cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sequencing tumors, trying to
find the druggable mutations in those
[SPEAKER_00]: tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only challenge is we didn't have very
non-toxic drugs at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got very interested in cannabis
because this is a plant that made a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous number of compounds that were
showing promise in cancer, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sequenced the first cannabis genome
back in 2011 and put it public.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Page followed up on this,
actually, referenced some of this work and
[SPEAKER_00]: did a much more thorough job and published
a lot of RNA sequencing and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That work came public shortly after and
has been a real boon to the entire field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we have multiple genomes that are
done, we can predict what we can do with
[SPEAKER_00]: PCR in a cannabis background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the course of these years,
I've luckily run into over 41,000
[SPEAKER_00]: citations in the work that we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work that I was mentored by,
by Eric Lander, he's now the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: advisor for President Biden.
[SPEAKER_00]: His citations are tenfold higher,
one of the most highly cited scientists in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a good understanding of what's
going on when it comes to PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that was really strong in
Dr. Lander's motivation was keeping data
[SPEAKER_00]: as public as possible because it floats
many more boats and it really helps buoy
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing that with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have sequenced the largest set of
cannabis DNA sequence that's out there in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world is public under our name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been actively putting these these
genomes public so that there's a resource
[SPEAKER_00]: for other people to build tools and so the
market grows faster than we can simply
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest these genomes ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also put some very relevant
publications forward, peer-reviewed,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are relevant to this very
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first cannabis microbiomes were
sequenced by us back in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also discovered a couple nasty
microbes that grow some really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxins that can be found on cannabis
in these publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also put public our primers for
doing this back in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really important point because
we stumbled on this for a few years when
[SPEAKER_00]: we were trying to get PCR to behave in
cannabis and distinguish yeast and molds
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we didn't have a cannabis
reference genome, we were making all types
[SPEAKER_00]: of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primers kept reacting on cannabis and
we couldn't distinguish fungi from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We solved that problem back in 2016 and I
want to demonstrate what that can do for
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to our experience in human
genomics, we've put a lot of fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I'm emphasizing this is
many of these genomes, at least 57 of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, we have sequenced without using
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just were able to get genome sequencing
off of spores alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that can be done now and
I think it's a really important thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: underscore because we do have some
regulators in this field that want to move
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire industry back to plating
because they believe that's the only way
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get DNA sequencing and that's just
outdated information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also notice this in the SARS
epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get sequencing off of viruses
without even culturing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're committed to putting a lot of
these genomes public and particularly we
[SPEAKER_00]: have been putting genomes public,
many of which are picked off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: backdrop here, that are fungal genomes
that exist on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a better understanding of the
microbiome and we have a better repertoire
[SPEAKER_00]: of what databases we need to navigate this
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the outline of the talk today,
now we have that backdrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of drawbacks of both
platforms and we should be honest about
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are drawbacks of culture in that the
vast majority of microbes are not
[SPEAKER_00]: culturable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it very difficult to have a
total yeast and mold test because the vast
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of your yeast and mold in fact
won't culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is poor selectivity with culture in
that the conditions you need to grow yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: and mold often grow bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever want to use antibiotics to
get rid of the bacteria, you're often
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibiting the mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show you some data on that in a few
slides forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plating is highly variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more so variable on yeast and mold
than it is on bacteria and we'll show you
[SPEAKER_00]: why.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to do with the fact that the mold
tends to be endophytic in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows inside the plant and is
vascularized in the plant and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get that out of the plant without lysing
open cell walls and fungi have cell walls
[SPEAKER_00]: and cell membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're typically lysing open both when
you want to get access to the endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi also have unique biological anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have knidia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call these things spore grenades.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a host of maybe a hundred or a
thousand spores on the end of a biological
[SPEAKER_00]: feature that you can easily pipette up in
one go and get very stochastic answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, thousands of CFUs in one plating
and when you do it again off the same
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix, you end up with nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what is known as heterogeneous
macro colonies in the filamentous fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also inhibitors that influence
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are putting matrix into a culture
system, you are not purifying any DNA out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are putting that onto a plate with all
of the inhibitors present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very serious issue with
cannabis because cannabis is 20% by weight
[SPEAKER_00]: made of antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made of cannabinoids and made of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those antibiotics vary tremendously
strain to strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have 100% THC lines, things that I
shouldn't say 100%, but 20% THC lines with
[SPEAKER_00]: a small fraction of maybe a 20 to 1 CBD
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have CBD dominant lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have CBG dominant lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have cannabinoid null lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole variety of different
cannabinoids that can be expressed and the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles are just as complicated
and those are known to play a role in as
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the flip side of this, we have some
drawbacks to PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's brought up quite
a bit is we're too sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pick up single molecules and that's
just going to fail everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see that in practice and we'll
touch on as to why we believe that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ITS and 16S targets that we
utilize for the total tests, the total
[SPEAKER_00]: aerobic tests and total yeast and mold
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can have variable copy number in
genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually, we believe, the benefit
not a curse and we'll explain that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: few slides forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in short, put shortly, you would
rather have more than one copy of a target
[SPEAKER_00]: in genome than something that doesn't
culture at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dealing with a 0 or 1 problem is really
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dealing with a 1 or 10 problem is very
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live versus dead needs to be considered
when you're dealing with PCR because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're amplifying DNA and it doesn't
matter whether it's inside or outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways and techniques that you
can use to enrich for things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can perform enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can centrifuge things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which pellets the cells and leaves the
free-floating DNA in solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can use nucleases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been employing a variety of those
techniques in the methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that is really critical moving
from bacteria to fungi is you really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand your cell lysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we arguably didn't fully
appreciate in the last few years and have
[SPEAKER_00]: recently modified our protocols to
address.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some standards brought to
market from organisms that we've never
[SPEAKER_00]: found on cannabis, Candida in particular,
that are very difficult to lice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to engineer a new lysis reagents to
actually tack those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that was an off target item for us
because we had not seen that organism in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis microbiome studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, it is a standard that's been
evolving in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had to modify protocols so we can
appropriately lice those things and be
[SPEAKER_00]: concordant with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the puck going in this world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, this will be federally
legalized here in the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at what the federal agencies
are doing, they're moving toward genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a genome tracker method down at
the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's doing genomic
surveillance on the food chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing this primarily because they
recognize the vast majority of microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: and risks to human health are not
culturable and we're never going to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: them up with the older methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other reason they're doing this is
it's faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had to culture everything for the
SARS coronavirus problem, we'd be in much
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper trouble than we are today because
the culturing just takes too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing is being voiced down at the
CDC as well with the PulseNet network
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're using DNA sequencing to
capture a snapshot of what's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the food chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was also reiterated by Frank Yiannis
at the 2019 AOAC conference where he
[SPEAKER_00]: underscored the need for genomic
surveillance and the need for blockchains
[SPEAKER_00]: to track these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe this is where things are going
and we believe it speaks in the direction
[SPEAKER_00]: of molecular methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everyone's tired of hearing about
coronavirus, but we do need to take a look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we use for coronavirus?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not culture things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did initially in that the Jaffar paper
here, Rita did a great job demonstrating
[SPEAKER_00]: what CT values correlated with the PFUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plaque forming units as opposed
to colony forming units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they had that calibration done,
they never went back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason for throwing it out is
culturing human pathogens is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think the laboratory regulations
are tight now, they're about to get
[SPEAKER_00]: tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all seen the news about what's going
on with the potential labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab leak out of Wuhan, that is going
to lead to a much more stringent
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not going to want you replicating
human pathogens in your lab simply to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure a small amount of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your assay requires making billions of
copies of a pathogen to measure a single
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them, they're going to be pushing
you toward PCR because you can replicate
[SPEAKER_00]: these things, measure them without them
being infectious using genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll reiterate, over a billion of these
PCR assays were done in the last year
[SPEAKER_00]: without any culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were still able to sequence millions
of these genomes without having to culture
[SPEAKER_00]: a single one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of the reasons why they did
this was quite evident in the Harcourt
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Harcourt paper demonstrated that the
cell line and the culturing conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: that you use can drastically vary the PFU
count.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were working with 293 T cells,
you had log scale lower results than if
[SPEAKER_00]: you were with varicells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, you can see there are
almost 10,000-fold differences based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the culturing conditions that you use to
get your PFU counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they had this calibrated on
varicells, they moved on and went with
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular methods all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think this is going to find its way
into our life in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly when federal
legalization is going to happen here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States, but we certainly think
even before that occurs, there is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more scrutiny applied to labs that are
managing pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to push the world in a
direction of using more molecular-based
[SPEAKER_00]: methods as opposed to traditional methods
that require replicating the pathogen to
[SPEAKER_00]: count it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This brings us to a common critique we
hear is that plating is a gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may have been true 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been used for probably 100 years now,
but the reality is it was developed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: timeframe when we didn't really understand
what we were counting.
[SPEAKER_00]: People began plating things before we even
knew what DNA was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at a stage now where we can count
these things more accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the terminology that we've been
using in the past needs to be modernized
[SPEAKER_00]: with what we can do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did do a study in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan was concerned that they were
missing pathogens using PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set up an ERV with AOAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran a large study only to find out that
PCR was finding more microbes than plating
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've then put together all of this work
and published this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still in peer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was effectively sequencing the whole
genome of every single colony that was in
[SPEAKER_00]: the study to figure out what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to walk you through some of the
design of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started with cannabis flowers that were
homogenized by a third-party lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: large quantities of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They segregated this and binned the
cannabis into three buckets that were
[SPEAKER_00]: measured using culture and
chloramphenicol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came up with bins of cannabis that
were high, medium, and low CFU counts as
[SPEAKER_00]: measured on something using
chloramphenicol, which is a selective
[SPEAKER_00]: agent to knock down bacteria, but we also
know it knocks down aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: These samples, once they were partitioned,
were sent out to fourth-party labs that
[SPEAKER_00]: would then run some of these experiments
on 10-gram samples in replica,
[SPEAKER_00]: five-time replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this study, one interesting thing
emerged is that we looked at what the
[SPEAKER_00]: three different culture mediums did
because many of the BAM chapters give you
[SPEAKER_00]: some latitude here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use PDA or DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not locked in on one culture
system, one antibiotic, and one growth
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have latitude there, and that
latitude, we want to see what does it
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had trained our QPCR system on
PDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were used to the correlation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In came DRBC, which has more selection
than PDA, and we got different numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what some of the experiment looked
like at the time it reached us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the colonies got larger than we
liked for sequencing, but fortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who counted these colonies in
the labs in Michigan pinpointed them with
[SPEAKER_00]: markers so we could tell where to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked those colonies and began
sequencing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right out of the gate, one thing you'll
notice is that there is a log scale
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in CFUs that we're seeing
between the different culture mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a 10-fold increase in the number
of CFUs found when you move from DRBC with
[SPEAKER_00]: chloramphenicol to PDA with
chloramphenicol, and another 10-fold
[SPEAKER_00]: increase when you go to PDA without any
chloramphenicol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a 100-fold variance in what a
CFU might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a regulation just says CFU,
we don't really know what that means,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're never going to get molecular
methods to really zero in on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really have to get the specifications
down pat and also debate which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: right specification because for patient
safety, they're not going to like DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the growers will like this because
it'll pass the most amount of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we'll show you, some of the most
dangerous pathogens are the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting omitted while using this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took aspergillus, which is the only
thing to really kill people in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took many flavors of them from ATCC and
started plating them as monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matrix background interfering with this
just to see do we pick them up with PCR,
[SPEAKER_00]: do we pick them up with PDA, and do we
pick them up with DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of them did not grow in
five days on PDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to push them out to seven days to
get some of the colonies to emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked up most of them with PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some weak CTs and rhizopests that
we're trying to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: PDA picked them all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we noticed in the ERV
study that we did in Michigan was that the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard deviations for plating were all
over the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it very hard to tune something
that has better standard deviations than
[SPEAKER_00]: plating against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now benchmarking this and being
asked to break PCR to make it as bad as
[SPEAKER_00]: DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real step backwards in our
opinion for patient safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the example of 5X replica
plating from the study where you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the standard deviations for plating are
all over the place, sometimes 42% variance
[SPEAKER_00]: on the actual count.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know from the prior slide,
there were many fewer colonies being
[SPEAKER_00]: counted on DRBC, so PCR overestimates and
tends to fail more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The standard deviations on the PCR side
are actually much tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I think labs
appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see highly reproducible
results that are accurate and that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: turned around very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plating is the opposite of all those three
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, the state looks like
it's moving forward on DRBC despite their
[SPEAKER_00]: initial public concerns that PCR was
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concern was raised by one laboratory
in the state that perjured themselves to
[SPEAKER_00]: the state claiming that our test was not
picking these things up when they never
[SPEAKER_00]: had purchased our complete kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole mess in Michigan started off
of a lab complaining to the state with
[SPEAKER_00]: fabricated data and now they've moved to
DRBC which is likely going to put patients
[SPEAKER_00]: at risk because of this problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have aspergillus that is public
literature showing that aspergillus is
[SPEAKER_00]: hindered by things like DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chloramphenicol antibiotics that are
present on this thing reduce the growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got evidence of it in our PCR data
and sequencing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is getting pushed upon all the
labs in Michigan to uproot all the gear
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've purchased in the past,
put in new gear, switch to something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's less sensitive, all under the
banner of patient safety when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going to be worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've also heard this, that plating
results actually represent the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: population on a sample because you're only
looking for things that are viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this isn't really true if there's
really strong selective pressure applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to culture the organisms
that can culture and then the moment you
[SPEAKER_00]: put selective pressure on there,
you end up with something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go through all the whole genome
sequencing that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper has all 45 genomes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just picked a few of them here to
give you a taste of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell these ones are on DRBC based
on the pink backdrop of the colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're looking at up here in the
upper left is the coverage map of these
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see a fairly horizontal line
there that shows you there is coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's about 80-fold
sequencing coverage on all the contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The contigs are sorted in size from the
longest contigs on the left to the
[SPEAKER_00]: shortest contigs on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get about 2,000 contigs out of these
assemblies from Illumina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we see multiple horizontal lines,
that tells us we have colonies on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: colonies or endofungal bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see even in this first batch
of samples with DRBC, we're picking up
[SPEAKER_00]: some pseudomonas on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is bacteria that's, in fact,
growing in this setting and contributing
[SPEAKER_00]: to the colony count, which is not fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pie charts on the right are how pure
the sequencing is in terms of the species
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're picking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this pie chart becomes a little bit
more fractured, like you see in this slide
[SPEAKER_00]: over here, you know that you've got a
metagenome, not a single genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start to see that in some of the
coverage plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see these other contigs that are
really high or low coverage that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: fitting to the mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sign that there's more than one
organism there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these two are very clearly fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here is probably a mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that's probably evident by
looking at the size of the genome that
[SPEAKER_00]: assembled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it does bring back memories
of other projects we've done in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there have been cases of Ralstonia
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ralstonia is a known endofungal bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows inside of fungi at very high copy
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it here in all these green
dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's really difficult
to resolve with plating, because it may
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily rear its head on the tack
plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's inside the fungi, you're
really not going to know what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get a colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll confuse colony counts and create
discordance between PCR methods and
[SPEAKER_00]: plating methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one artifact that we've got to
pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we move on to PDA, as you remember
from the previous slide up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had 10-fold more colonies with PDA and
chloramphenicol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we end up with about a 50-50 mix of
bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do the math there, that means
there's about 5x more fungi and PDA than
[SPEAKER_00]: there is on DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also bacteria you have to sift
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this makes counting colonies a little
bit more tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a colony counting problem,
not a PCR problem, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these colonies are clearly
fungi based on their looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right next to them, you can see some
bacteria that are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another colony there that's fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you get to some colonies that look
like they're merged or they're colonies on
top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these pie charts widen out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the coverage charts that
are giving you multiple different
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a sequencing standpoint,
we can still ascertain the diversity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these microbiomes all assemble
into their discrete contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can still classify a multi-colony
event as a problem for counting colonies
[SPEAKER_00]: by eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a problem for sequencing genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can discern exactly what's going on by
sequencing everything that's present.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is PDA with no chloramphenicol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, the ratio starts to
shift toward the predominant number of
[SPEAKER_00]: species here, in fact, bacteria,
because there's no antibiotic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still fungi coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally, those fungi have
bacteria underneath them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes for some messy counting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summary of all the 45 colonies that were
shotgun sequenced is listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you break them down to the species
level, you can get some resolution here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the different types of penicillium that
are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one that we published in 2016 is
quite prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably something that should be
on the target list for things we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting and testing, because it's,
in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: making bacteria a pull-through.
[SPEAKER_00]: PDA with chloramphenicol is about a 50-50
balance of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And PDA without it seems to bend the ratio
in the other direction more toward
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria than for fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you remember there being
10-fold differences in the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: colonies between each of these,
you can ascertain that about there's 5x
[SPEAKER_00]: less fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing up on DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a total yeast and mold
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: By any means, this is a partial yeast and
mold test that's being adopted probably
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's easier to count colonies by
eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a human anthropomorphism,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't like counting colonies visually
when they blend together, and DRBC does a
[SPEAKER_00]: better job making them more distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way of monitoring this problem is
to put all the DNA sequences through a
[SPEAKER_00]: Simpsons diversity test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that monitors what is
the diversity of the organisms coming
[SPEAKER_00]: through in a particular pool of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it comes up with the most
diversity coming out of PDA versus DRBC
[SPEAKER_00]: with chloramphenicol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to send you an updated version
of the slide that's not cutting off these
[SPEAKER_00]: axis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is PDA with chloramphenicol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is PDA alone, and this is DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Simpsons diversity index are most
diverse on the PDA pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other way to look at this is to
take organisms and plate them without any
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix background.
[SPEAKER_00]: In confusing things, and you plate them on
this case we did on PDA and PDA with
[SPEAKER_00]: tartaric acid just to get chloramphenicol
out of the picture to see what was
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get very similar results when there
aren't bacteria obscuring things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a pure monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same results between these two plates,
but a massive drop off with DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar, if you take Aspergillus niger and
put it onto chloramphenicol and no
[SPEAKER_00]: chloramphenicol PDR plates, we get similar
counts, but a massive drop off when we go
[SPEAKER_00]: to DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take Petritus scenario,
probably the most commonly found mold on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, well not necessarily considered
a very harmful human pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an allergen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing has massive growth on PDA,
almost none on DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, if you want to pass more cannabis,
use DRBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients won't be happy, but the
growers will love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's some other issues on using
plating, which is endophytes, knidia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and inhibitors all play a role
disproportionately in plating when they do
[SPEAKER_00]: over molecular methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is Aspergillus flavus,
all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of there is a knidia, that's a
spore, what we call a spore grenade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pipette one of those things,
and if you break it up in the pipetting
[SPEAKER_00]: process, it will turn into 100 to 1,000
different colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't break it up in the pipetting
process, it will turn into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what's known as this
heterogeneous macro colony problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it means sample homogenization needs
to be extreme, so extreme that we would
[SPEAKER_00]: argue you should just lyse everything open
and measure the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you don't do this, you're gonna
get very stochastic sampling, which you
[SPEAKER_00]: see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is taking sample from the same
homogenized cannabis flower and plating it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a replica many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you find is eventually you get
one or two colonies, one or two colonies,
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two colonies, bang, you get a
knidia, you get a grenade, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why there's very high variability
in plating filamentous fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just do a single plating
experiment, you're really setting yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: up for lots of lab to lab discordance and
lots of arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you dilute this further, it all goes
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you're seeing there on the
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did document this before, and this is
present in one of our preprints,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we did this with aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aspergillus spores can clump like this
and give you these heterogeneous macro
[SPEAKER_00]: colonies as you go through a dilution on
different plating systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you very digital results
because if you don't fully treat these
[SPEAKER_00]: things with soaps and heavily homogenize
them and lyse them effectively,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't really quantitate these things
unless you can figure out how to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: declumping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's turn to inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people will say, oh, there are
polymerase inhibitors out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be true if you're doing a
simple boil prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take this sampling and just simply
boil it and then put that into PCR,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are exposed to the polymerase
inhibitors that might be there from the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes to the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things there that could
potentially inhibit polymerases.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're performing a DNA isolation,
like we are performing in our methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that stuff gets an ethanol
extraction and gets washed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up with highly purified DNA
that doesn't present any inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is very different in the
plating environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the plating environment, you have to
live with the fact that those inhibitors
[SPEAKER_00]: could be antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the cannabis, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very potent antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very interesting paper that came
out recently about another plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesizes cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of new to people in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called tremor orientalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, it doesn't produce a
lot of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces something of the order of 30
to 100 micrograms per mL, so maybe 100 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 foot lower than what you might get
from a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, they recognized that
this small amount of cannabinoids was
[SPEAKER_00]: creating inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are ATCC organisms that are
inhibited in a very strain-specific manner
[SPEAKER_00]: from this plant that makes 100-fold less
cannabinoids than the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we believe this is happening on the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been trying to track this down and
measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very difficult experiment to do
because you really have to control the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this experiment needs more replication
because we don't have the terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled for, but we have been seeing
some strain to strain on our CT to CFU
[SPEAKER_00]: curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the CFUs come out very different,
the CTs are on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that might be related to the
different chemotypes that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed in the plating process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still present when you plate,
but they're gone when we purify the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: for measuring the DNA types, or at least
the fungal load that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that comes through in the
cannabis space are sometimes citrates in
[SPEAKER_00]: the candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are listed on 3M's product as being
inhibitory to the readout chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli is there, but the readout chemistry
isn't marking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the top row up here has
lots of colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you add the candy, they are
decreased in number.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is presumably due to the two citrates
affecting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Citrates are quite common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some calmatic systems have citrate in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not just only in candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be present in some of the growing
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want to talk about a paper that was
printed about a month ago about PCR not
[SPEAKER_00]: being a silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a good paper in that very few
people have published on this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put some publications out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zemir Punja has put some out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a group called Thompson that puts
them out in California looking at cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can probably count the number of
cannabis microbiome papers on your two
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very thin field at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we very much welcome Willow jumping
into this space and measuring this.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they got about halfway through
this compared to what we did in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: They noticed there was discordancies
between CFUs and CTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you go one step further,
you'll notice this is not as much a
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection of the discordance in PCR as it
is in the fact that none of the plating
[SPEAKER_00]: systems ever agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they were to step back and do this
on multiple different plating formats,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would recognize the variance they're
seeing is actually related to the culture
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the equation, not the PCR side of
the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few things they brought up that we
agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ITS copy number can be a problem,
but we don't believe this is a bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe it's a feature, as I mentioned
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if 90% of your organisms don't
culture, you have a 0 versus 1 problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have a 1 versus 10 problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, they brought up ITS regions
or 16S regions that had four fold more
[SPEAKER_00]: copies in one organism than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they attributed their differences to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out their differences,
we believe, are due to something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll touch on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also were concerned about kit
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we think is a canard.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our customers run NTCs,
no template controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if any of those show signal,
we'd be hearing about it, particularly if
[SPEAKER_00]: they showed a signal of a CT of 21,
which would fail almost every sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cannabis labs around the world would
be failing if that were, in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: a universal problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually think this relates to some of
the primers that they're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll walk you through some of the
pitfalls of designing primers in absence
[SPEAKER_00]: of knowledge of the cannabis genome,
which I think is what happened here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They observed some overestimation of CFUs
to CTs, and I think this comes down to how
[SPEAKER_00]: you measure that on the plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll dive into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the primers that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't their primers per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pulled them out of the literature,
but many of the people in the literature
[SPEAKER_00]: who designed these ITS primers did not
anticipate running them with plants as the
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants have ITS regions that are very
similar to fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you pick the wrong primer sets,
you're going to amplify both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the copy number of the ITS regions in
the cannabis genome are far higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: they are in the fungal genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing's true with 16S sequences,
which meant to target bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are mitochondria that look like
bacteria inside of plants, and they are a
[SPEAKER_00]: very high copy number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you don't design your 16S
primers correctly, you end up amplifying
[SPEAKER_00]: plant mitochondria, thinking of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything here in red is a perfect
homology of the primers to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have three prime homology,
which means they're going to amplify.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're perfectly homologous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll comb through a few of those
alignments in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also using Cyber Green versus
TaqMan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cyber Green has an intercalating dye in
PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that any product you make,
whether it's a primer dimer, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis amplicon, or whether it's a
fungal amplicon, is going to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: signal with Cyber Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: TaqMan is far more specific in that
there's a probe in there that has to match
[SPEAKER_00]: your target, and only that gives you
signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very critical for navigating high
copy number ITS regions, because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: design probes that actually target only
one of the ITS regions as opposed to all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, and that can get you to normalize
some of this ITS imbalance that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we mentioned earlier, the study
really didn't look at multiple forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: plating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a major weakness of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put this stuff public.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to download this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have this thing available for folks
to download later if they don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember this and crazy long link.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see these alignments of their
primers to the cannabis genome are full
[SPEAKER_00]: length and perfectly landing on the three
prime end.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will amplify cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw these out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no point in working with these in
the cannabis background.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something that won't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've published some that do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show you what those are in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you really want to be getting primers
that are very specific, and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a probe in there if you can,
so you can drive higher specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the work that they show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually some nice correlation
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they're offset a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the CQs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the CFUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is actually really nice work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just they're concerned over some of
these gaps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these gaps are between different
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the assumption in this paper was that
they should grow the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're going to show you is they
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we'd highlight is
that this is suggesting just overnight
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get away with just guessing the
CT.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't guess the time frame that you
grow these either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be very specific here because
the bacteria double every 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Vibrio doubles every 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Precision is needed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be like hiding the CT scale on
any PCR paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you grow them the same time,
and under the same temperature on three
[SPEAKER_00]: different medias, you get this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Bacillus, which was mentioned in
the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Staph.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow them in LB versus 2XYT versus
3M, here 3M gives you three-fold more
[SPEAKER_00]: colonies than LB and 2XYT.
[SPEAKER_00]: You move to Bacillus, and suddenly the
colonies are enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get almost no colonies on 3M.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get almost 20-fold more on LB,
or 10-fold more, 10 to 30-fold more on
[SPEAKER_00]: 2XYT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the failure to have a really
defined CFU puts the whole field into
[SPEAKER_00]: chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because depending on which one of these
methods you use, no one ever agrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the labs point at one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headlines end up in the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the consumers end up not
having any confidence in the regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've really got to dial in on what we're
measuring here so that we don't create
[SPEAKER_00]: this public panic and that we all
understand exactly what it is we're
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put all the primer alignments here
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can download these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We realigned them actually to CS10,
which is the genome that we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: assemble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an independent party assembled that
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps that's less biased in taking a
genome that we put public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I want to touch on just
inclusivity and exclusivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the real key difference
between the platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why you can have a more
sensitive platform like PCR and have it
[SPEAKER_00]: fail less material is because it is more
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have bacteria showing up where
they shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has more dynamic range.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get about seven logs of dynamic
range with PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you struggle to get three with
plating.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start to get out toward the third
log and plating, you have colonies on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of colonies and you start to undercount.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get extraordinarily low,
you can't discern plates that are negative
[SPEAKER_00]: from plates that someone just didn't
pipette on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no internal control in plating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get a blank plate,
you assume that's a pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could just as likely be someone forgot
to plate anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: With PCR, you have that internal control
that always tells you, you amplified
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reaction worked as expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can measure off of that as to
whether you should take the data and go
[SPEAKER_00]: forward with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's fundamentally
missing in the plating environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you look at inclusion and
exclusion criteria on many other systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's usually around 30 to 50 inclusion
and exclusion criteria that gets done on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these AOAC tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the brochure from 3M.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's actually a typo in this
brochure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have five out of 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really meant to have 15 out
of 19 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give them the benefit of the doubt
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're getting about 79% if you
assume that's 15, grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that means you've got 21% of the
organisms that didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cherry pick these organisms for
their study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens when you don't get to
cherry pick them and you take something
[SPEAKER_00]: off a cannabis matrix?
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers are probably going to be much
lower than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down here in exclusivity,
they get 21% of the colonies are
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things are not excluding the
bacteria and they're not picking up all
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at this with PCR,
the numbers are much cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's going on with PCR
is that you can go beyond each one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these organisms from ATCC may cost you
$100 to $300 to order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to order thousands of them,
it's going to take you a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a very expensive
endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with PCR, you know what amplicons
amplify with your primers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can extrapolate how many
other organisms would amplify if you just
[SPEAKER_00]: scan them against NCBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get into thousands of organisms
with PCR that will have confidence of
amplification.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cannot be said with plating because
you can't anticipate what's going to plate
[SPEAKER_00]: based on giving carbon sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at this stuff with PCR,
the selectivity is much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 96, we basically ordered 52
organisms from ATCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 of them we're able to detect in 90
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you're looking at what's going on
in plating and it's like 15 out of 19 in
[SPEAKER_00]: three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much rather have 90 minutes in 96% than
79% in three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you look at the bacteria side of
things, they're getting 21% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms that are being bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get any.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why other systems or this is why
culture is failing more is because when
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria is present and some people do use
bacteria as some type of additive for
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial microbial usage in the plants,
that stuff will carry through and can
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck your plating caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing you can do is take these
primer sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were published.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to grab them and check
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take these things and scan them
against well-curated databases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important thing to do is to make sure
they're packed bioassemblies because the
[SPEAKER_00]: ITS regions don't always assemble
perfectly with Illumina data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you curate the data appropriately,
you can see that we can reach thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not seen any total yeast and mold
test out there that can claim that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown thousands of organisms and prove
that they all grow on their culture
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually stop at around 100 because
it's too expensive and takes too much
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention a lot of them just don't
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This brings us to the final point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does QPCR fail more samples?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the case of Michigan,
we certainly did because they moved to a
[SPEAKER_00]: system that has very high selective
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you look back at some of the
publications, we never resorted to a
[SPEAKER_00]: single medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do this in the past, we would
triangulate this across three different
[SPEAKER_00]: culture systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see down below three MP3 films,
BioLumex and Simplates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have to average the CFU results
from those three platforms and then
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrate the CFU curve according to the
average of the three platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that means when you compare yourself
against any given one of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does mean when we're dealing with a
marketplace where every customer might be
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing this to a different plating
system, it's probably the safest approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what else you will notice going on in
this study is we looked at what the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: content looked like directly off the
cannabis plant and what happened after you
[SPEAKER_00]: cultured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was radically different
results based on the culture platform that
[SPEAKER_00]: you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is public.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go view it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been peer reviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a transparent review system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think John McPartland and Ethan Russo
were involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a wealth of information on
there as to how things change when you
[SPEAKER_00]: apply culture to the actual microbial
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real problem here is that we have
exquisite sensitivity and specificity with
[SPEAKER_00]: PCR, and culture has no idea what the hell
it's measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult to have these
discussions with folks on why are there
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between these platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the culture folks are kind of staring
at tarot cards and we're bringing forward
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genome sequencing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other thing you can do with PCR
once you have this running is you can
[SPEAKER_00]: tackle things that don't culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew doesn't culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The viruses don't culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have helped many grows using hops
latent viral testing and lettuce chlorosis
[SPEAKER_00]: virus testing using PCR so they can avoid
problems like this that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a grow that actually adopted PCR
and was able to clean out their LCD and
[SPEAKER_00]: their hops latent viral infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get their yields back up another 40%
because this was wrecking them late in
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a platform that we don't yet know
whether these viruses play any role in
[SPEAKER_00]: human health, but they certainly play a
role in plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a universal platform that can
help plant health and also bring some
[SPEAKER_00]: color on human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so in conclusions here,
there is a clinical paradox going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: culture based methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need robust homogenization just
for good sampling statistics and to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with these clumps that occur with knidia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is orthogonal diviability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get at the endophytes,
you have to aggressively homogenize the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample, which is going to shred up
microbes so they're not viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best thing we believe is just lice
that all open and measure the DNA and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get the best proxy for
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one clinical liability in
cannabis is aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a doubt, if you go comb through
the clinical literature, most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillosis that's going on and any
clinical death, it's not THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is people that are getting
aspergillosis usually immunocompromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an endophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we adopt methods that select against
aspergillus growth with DRBC and with
[SPEAKER_00]: against endophytes because we're resorting
to culture, we are playing a game that the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient's not going to be pleased with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would argue you want to move to
molecular methods that can properly lice
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things and that you want to get
the regulations to adequately allow those
[SPEAKER_00]: things, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you anchor everything and see a few
language, particularly very vague and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-specific CFU language, you're just
going to invite laboratory fights for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in doing so, you have to pay attention
to live-dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably the home of the
webinars, how we deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But live-dead can be tackled with PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another myth that it can't handle
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are multiple techniques that are
being utilized in the field to manage the
[SPEAKER_00]: live-dead situation from centrifugation to
enrichment to using nucleases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other infections that we have seen
in the field, there has been fusarium
[SPEAKER_00]: cutaneous infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a plant endophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been cryptococcal meningitis
infections from pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is measured in Bakersfield,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also an endophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other things that have come up are
seminal and mycobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are epiphytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are bacteria that are on the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: These probably can be addressed with
either PCR or plating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's really the epiphytes that we have
to turn our attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a lot of jurisdictional
heterogeneity out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone's requiring total use in
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: California luckily got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they moved toward all molecular
methods looking at aspergillus in a
[SPEAKER_00]: species-specific manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also this question of what is the
clinical actionability of 10,000 CFUs or
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 CFUs of these total things,
which we've shown you are not total
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are partial things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not necessarily measuring
anything of clinical relevance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just counting colonies at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't even have a good sense of
what the colony is, whether it's bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: or fungi, or whether it's harmful or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing this exercise all the
while knowing that the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes don't even culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really an interesting,
I think, security theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other thing that comes into play
here is when you start using these very
[SPEAKER_00]: grotesque tools, like total use in mold
and total robot count, is you basically
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate the grower's ability to use
beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those light those systems up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where that pushes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it push them to pesticide use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do they go?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're going to need to do something
to fight back pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And putting in these nonspecific tests
with no clinical utility basically strips
[SPEAKER_00]: away one of their most green and
environmental tools that they could be
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So collusions, we think to see a few is an
abused, nonspecific term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the BAM, there is a lot of
latitude on what type of plating you can
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this means people could adopt and lab
shop based on labs who use the most
[SPEAKER_00]: stringent plating systems that fail the
least amount of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think the regulation should be
modernized in line with where the FDA and
[SPEAKER_00]: the CDC are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe the desire to actually keep
this grounded in culture because you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that's the only way that you can
sequence a genome is patently false and
[SPEAKER_00]: can be shown throughout the literature
that that is no longer the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sequence genomes without culture
quite readily today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's done routinely for even RNA
viruses like SARS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think the total tests are security
theater, as I've mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not giving us any clinical
utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are creating a tremendous amount of
friction in the labs, making labs uproot
[SPEAKER_00]: and change the different testing
techniques that they need and not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily giving any benefit to the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we believe what happened in
Michigan is going to add risk to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer, even though that was the exact
opposite of what the regulators were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we believe that this can be tuned with
PCR, but we need to get together with many
[SPEAKER_00]: of the regulators in the labs to structure
what those regulations should be and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they should be written.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ask everyone in this audience to
try and share this information with them
[SPEAKER_00]: if they can because we do think it is time
to recraft these and modernize these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species-specific testing would make far
more sense in our mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'm going to leave it for
questions because I think I'm running out
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Kevin, for a great
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to remind everyone, if you do have a
question to ask of Kevin, the Q&A icon at
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom of your screen is the best way
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will ask those as they come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give a minute to see if any populate
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's from Sherry Pearson.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we move forward with the state of
Maryland tomorrow is moving to culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know how to get through to
state of Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing about what they're doing
down there that can be justified in the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to push everything into culture
and the justification I heard was that
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to do that so that they can
sequence things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone down there needs to read a
biology book that they can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence these things without culturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, most people before they want to
sequence something is they purify the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: like you do for PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suspect there's going to be a lot of
turmoil in Maryland and that this needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out to the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients need to know that if they
push them in a direction, the direction
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're going, there is going to be
more cannabis on the market that has risk
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That liability should fall right back to
the regulator who's doing this on no sign
[SPEAKER_00]: to the grounds whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question here about Live Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you could expand a bit
more on what capabilities are out there
[SPEAKER_01]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of ways we skin that cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a step in our yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different ways we've come
about trying to address this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our yeast and mold system right now has an
enzymatic lysis that's lysing open more
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi than we were doing last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the recent update that we put out
to address the candidate issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: That enzyme is not compatible with the
nucleases that we were using for Live
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we switched that over to a
centrifugation-based step where you spin
[SPEAKER_00]: and pellet the cells down, leave the free
circulating DNA in solution with that
[SPEAKER_00]: pelleting step, and then isolate that
pellet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we used to do in the past was use a
nuclease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still use that nuclease for Live
Dead in our other assays, and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a nuclease that doesn't penetrate
cell membranes and eats up free
[SPEAKER_00]: circulating DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, right now, that enzyme is not
compatible with the TLP enzyme we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: to lys open the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bifurcated approach on the test
right now for Live Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way to address it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way we've seen other people
address this is to grow a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: enrich for X amount of time, and only the
replicative organisms will replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are dead will get drowned
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You then have to adjust your CTs
accordingly to your doubling rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an alternative approach,
but it can be dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the providers in the field are all
coming up with their own creative ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next one is from Brett Lorenz.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of a risk do you think mycotoxins
are in the cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good question on mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not seen any papers suggesting
poisoning of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that this is something that's a
chronic problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't tend to get an acute effect with
mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be damage over long haul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also not seen a lot of literature on
the failure rates for mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have a lot of states that are
mandating these things, but when I have
[SPEAKER_00]: surveyed them and asked around,
most of the labs say they rarely ever fail
[SPEAKER_00]: something for mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycotoxins are usually synthesized in a
saprophytic state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that the cannabis plants ever
get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're mostly at a state where
they've been quickly cured and they get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the customer before anything rots.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, we had a program to try
and build an amino PCR system that would
[SPEAKER_00]: pick these things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it on ice because we were just not
seeing enough data in the field that the
[SPEAKER_00]: fail rates were high enough to justify the
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought longer term people may ... If
we have five years of no fails of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine regulators will just pass
on it, no longer insist on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one area we have thrown up some
caution is that there are a paper that we
[SPEAKER_00]: published showing that there are
mycotoxins that are being made by some
[SPEAKER_00]: penicillium species that interfere with
the anti-epileptic properties of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be something that's really
meaningful for the epilepsy crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an area that needs more work to
know how much citrinum and paxiline can we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually tolerate on this when you're
trying to extract these things for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients in the epilepsy field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extraction process might enrich these
things above and beyond the levels that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could have some negative
consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not scanning right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen any regulations out there
that are looking for the penicillium based
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an unknown field at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question here from Eric Lieber,
who is an Arizona local and wants to know
[SPEAKER_01]: how we can find out if his state is using
culture testing or PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any guidance there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I broke up a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll ask it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's someone here from Arizona who is
curious to find out if there's anywhere he
[SPEAKER_01]: can find out if the state is using or
allowing culture or QPCR testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have to deflect that to somebody
else here who might be more familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what's going on in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did read this week in the news that
there was some aspergillus outbreak in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also read somewhere that they're
removing aspergillus testing altogether
[SPEAKER_00]: and that seemed odd considering they just
had some news of that in the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to get back to you on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone here knows the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have it at the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric, if you're listening, if you want to
shoot us an email, info at
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinalgenomics.com, we can route that
to the appropriate person to follow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more here coming back to LiveDead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your solution for LiveDead remove
only free DNA or will it also remove DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: from dead cells that have not released
their DNA into solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nucleus does not penetrate the cell
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is if there's a ruptured
membrane, will it get in there and still
[SPEAKER_00]: chew up the DNA inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we have proof of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hypothesize that it would,
but I've got to think through how to set
[SPEAKER_00]: up an experiment that would sort that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a bit tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know the molecular weight of the
actual enzyme, so it doesn't need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very big hole for this thing to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine it would chew it up if the
membrane is ruptured, but we've not set up
[SPEAKER_00]: any experiments to directly address that
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more came in and I'm going to sneak it
in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard of any interference between
rapid 3M yeast and mold plates in certain
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Such as seeds or nut butters?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not heard anything directly on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard mostly from candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some literature out there in the
food testing space that when you move to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of spices, you have to revalidate
things because the spices have lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: active compounds that can throw off some
of the testing platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to dig up those references.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't recall whether they were directly
addressing 3M or BioMeriU or what platform
[SPEAKER_00]: that was specific to, but I think coumarin
was one that came up as being an inhibitor
[SPEAKER_00]: to many of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all the time we have today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Kevin, for joining us and
sharing your knowledge on this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone who joined us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be sending out an email with the
recording of this presentation and also a
[SPEAKER_01]: list of all the different resources that
we've put together over the years of blogs
[SPEAKER_01]: and articles and papers around this topic
for more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be on the lookout for that and thanks
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
