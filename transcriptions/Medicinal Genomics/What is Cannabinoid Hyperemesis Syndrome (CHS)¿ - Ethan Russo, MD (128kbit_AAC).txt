So
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that, I'm sure there are some
people watching or listening who aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you give us a rundown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a condition that was first
published in 2004 in Australia based on
[SPEAKER_00]: several cases with an index case going
back to 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's interesting is usually when
something's reported for the first time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a real evolution of the
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they nailed it pretty much from
the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they were describing was a
situation in which chronic cannabis users
[SPEAKER_00]: developed a syndrome in which they had
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: often cyclic, that seemingly was relieved
by hot water bathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the patients involved would
spend hours in the tub or the shower to
[SPEAKER_00]: try and relieve symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gradually has become more
frequent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either ascertainment has improved or what
many of us think is that it's become more
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent over time with the greater
prevalence of high potency cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this seems mainly tied to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we should point out that it's really
an issue with any CB1, cannabinoid 1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor agonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the problem has also been
described in people who are using some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the synthetics, the high potency synthetic
CB1 agonists in total absence of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been other people that thought
or would like to attribute this to
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, people get this even with
organically grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it or not, cannabis is the
culprit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these bouts with vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as I understand it, this isn't just
sort of like an acute response where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you kind of have one episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going on for quite some time,
hours, sometimes days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's an important distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can get sick from cannabis if they
have exposure all of a sudden to too high
[SPEAKER_00]: a THC level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think many people have had the
experience of using a vape for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time or having an edible that was too
powerful and actually getting sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of counterintuitive to people
because everybody knows that you use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, at least in low doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't make sense to people that
you can have this reaction that seems
[SPEAKER_00]: illogical.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's very consistent with what we
know about cannabinoids, that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: what's called a biphasic dose response
curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to break that down, it means that a
lot of the cannabinoids will have one
[SPEAKER_00]: activity at a low dose and an opposite
activity at a much higher dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that explains how people can get
sick from THC acutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's quite different from CHS,
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is a subacute or chronic
problem where people will have these
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing bouts of attacks of nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, they go on until they
abstain.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we'll get into, there are treatments
for it, but they're a little different
[SPEAKER_00]: than what we'd expect as well.
Thank you.
