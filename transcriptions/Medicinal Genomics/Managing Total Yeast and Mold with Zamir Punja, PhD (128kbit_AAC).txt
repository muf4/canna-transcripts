[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have signed up for email alerts
at canmedevents.com, or if you follow us
[SPEAKER_00]: on social media, then you saw that the
CanMed 24 Innovation and Investment Summit
[SPEAKER_00]: will return to the J.W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marriott Resort in Marco Island,
Florida, May 12th through 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed 23 was our first year on Marco
Island, and the feedback was
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelmingly positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beach, the food, the amenities,
the networking opportunities, and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course, the content presented,
were all exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CanMed 24 is shaping up to be even
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Registration will be opening up soon and
tickets are limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you haven't yet, sign up for email
alerts at canmedevents.com so you are
[SPEAKER_00]: among the first to know when tickets go on
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this episode, we brought back Dr. Zamir
Poonja to talk about total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zamir is a professor of plant
biotechnology at Simon Fraser University
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: His research interests include the
etiology and management of plant diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: on vegetable and horticultural crops,
and the application of plant biotechnology
[SPEAKER_00]: for disease management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2018, his work has shifted on
researching cannabis, and his group has
[SPEAKER_00]: described a range of previously unreported
pathogens affecting the crop, and has
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluated various methods for disease
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: His team just published the results of a
three-year study that identified several
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that have a direct effect on yeast
and mold levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They include factors related to growing,
drying, and trimming cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because when growers
fail for microbial testing, yeast and mold
[SPEAKER_00]: is often the reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a grower that has struggled
with total yeast and mold, perhaps these
[SPEAKER_00]: findings in the paper and on this podcast
can help you get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put a link to the paper in the show
description, and if you're watching on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube, I've added several figures and
images from the paper throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cover the different species of yeast
and mold that are commonly found on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and which are potentially harmful
to humans, the value of total yeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: mold testing as an indicator of product
safety and quality, what is a reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold for total yeast and mold,
how cannabis' genotype affects total yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: and mold levels, why leaf litter drives up
TYM levels, why hang drying is a better
[SPEAKER_00]: method than wet trimming, the drawbacks of
irradiation, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Samir, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Agilent Technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manufacture or test cannabis,
you face the challenge of delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: high-quality products, increasing sample
volume, and meeting emerging regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agilent offers best-in-class cannabis and
hemp analysis solutions featuring robust
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments, software, services,
and consumables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their team of experts can develop,
implement, and optimize methods to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: up and running quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at Agilent.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Samir Poonja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Samir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to get you back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to get you back in quick,
too, because I know that you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: team, you recently published a great paper
about total yeast and mold in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of our favorite topics here on
the podcast and at Medicinal Genomics,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total yeast and mold seems to be one of
those tests that growers really struggle
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: More often than not, if a batch is failing
for microbial, it's either for total yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: and mold, or maybe more specifically,
aspergillus, which is a fungi and would be
[SPEAKER_00]: included in that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to explore that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that your paper includes some facts
that you've identified for causing high
[SPEAKER_00]: TYM levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we can get some good best
practices or recommendations for growers
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can enact so that they have
fewer failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into that, I wanted to ask
you why you and your team were interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in investigating TYM in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: TYM in cannabis is certainly one of the
most common things that growers will
[SPEAKER_01]: encounter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere in the sense that yeast
and mold is not specific to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apples, blueberries, raspberries,
strawberries, you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peanuts, any product that's grown out
either in the field or even indoors will
[SPEAKER_01]: always capture a certain proportion of
yeast and mold because these organisms
[SPEAKER_01]: feed off of plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any exudates, any nutrients, anything
coming out of a flower or a potato or a
[SPEAKER_01]: pond, will attract some level of yeast and
mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, these yeast and molds
aren't necessarily harmful to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you consume an apple that's got some
yeast and mold, the tendency is for the
[SPEAKER_01]: body to break it all down and digest it
all, and it's basically gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, of course, because of the
various ways it's used, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: inhaled or baked or extracted from,
yeast and mold apparently has raised
[SPEAKER_01]: greater concern in cannabis than it has
potentially on other food crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the regulatory agencies have
established the criteria for testing for
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast and mold and established levels that
will cause a product to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason it's hard to manage and the
reason we were interested in it is because
[SPEAKER_01]: it is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to find out, are there certain
things that growers may be doing or not
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that may increase or decrease the
levels of yeast and mold in their product?
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't actually manipulate the yeast
and molds that were naturally occurring,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what we did was we tried to understand
if you planted a certain genotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you had a certain type of air
circulation, if you were leaving a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf litter on the floor, would those
things increase or decrease the levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast and mold?
[SPEAKER_01]: Up until now, nobody's actually looked at
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've looked at yeast and mold after a
product is harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you irradiate it,
what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you heat it up to a certain
temperature, what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you analyze it in a lab using different
methods, what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to find out from a grower
perspective, what could they be doing to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to reduce those levels in flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you find?
[SPEAKER_00]: More specifically, I know that you've
identified certain types of species that
[SPEAKER_00]: you found in more abundance than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that might be a good thing
to explore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We analyzed all the types of yeast and
mold we found total.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually went a step further and
identified all the different species using
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Penicillium was the one that seemed to be
the most prevalent on cannabis flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, again, penicillium is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a home that has slightly
damp conditions, you'll find it in your
[SPEAKER_01]: basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find it in your rug.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find it sometimes in your clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, most of us can deal with it in
our bodies because we're used to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may be inhaling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so much of an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in cannabis, and we don't know enough
about penicillium actually, it may or may
[SPEAKER_01]: not be of concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first, the most prevalent one
we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we found a bunch of others that
normally occur in the air, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: alternaria and another fungus called
cladosporium, which is quite common in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspergillus wasn't that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: The overall levels of aspergillus we found
wasn't high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is under greenhouse cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a lot of plant material
laying around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not next to a wooded area or a
forest where you may have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus flying in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blowing it through the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't a big concern in terms of the
sampling we did in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found primarily the penicilliums and
then some alternaria and cladosporium
[SPEAKER_01]: species present.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you mentioned aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you looking specifically at the
species level too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it the pathogenic strains of
aspergillus, your flavus, fumigatus,
[SPEAKER_00]: niger, terrius?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The primers we used should have been able
to separate those out because then we also
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at sequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't find a lot of the fumigatus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't find a lot of the pathogenic
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one we found was called aspergillus
ocracius.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a yellow aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can, on a petri dish,
when you grow these moles like we do for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time, one of them is black,
another one is green, another one is gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ours is yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a species that is not on the current
list of regulated aspergillus species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's not to say it's not important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just for some reason it's never made
it onto that list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's not pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't been flagged as being a
pathogenic species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these aspergillus, they're pretty
much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on decaying plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just so happens that in the greenhouse,
we picked up more of this yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus species.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one we found was aspergillus
niger, which is a black aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's not one of the really
species of concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones like the fumigatus and the other
ones, we didn't see a lot of in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses that we were working with.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Niger actually is on the list for many
states as one of the big four pathogenics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found a few of those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the others that you've mentioned,
are they known to be pathogenic or even
[SPEAKER_00]: benign to people?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we looking at there?
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest concern I would say with a lot
of these yeast and moles is the toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say toxin, I don't mean something
really scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce these chemical by-products as
they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow it up in the lab, as these
cultures grow, as they get a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: older, they produce these chemical
structures that are referred to as
[SPEAKER_01]: mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both penicillium and aspergillus will
produce some of these mycotoxins,
[SPEAKER_01]: which again, it's on the radar for
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: OTA, for example, ochratoxin is a
mycotoxin produced by both aspergillus and
[SPEAKER_01]: penicillium species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can cause some issues if it's ingested
at a very high concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, penicillium, you see that on
moldy cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheese that turns blue has penicillium on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ate a lot of that, you would
probably end up with some issues in your
[SPEAKER_01]: tummy because there's secondary
metabolites or toxins produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how much or if any toxins
are produced by the penicillium species in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that perhaps will end up
on the radar eventually, how much of these
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins are produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium, on the other hand, which is
known to infect wheat and barley and other
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural crops, does produce a lot of
very dangerous mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is called vomitoxin,
which when it's ingested, when the barley
[SPEAKER_01]: or wheat is ingested by animals like cows
or cattle, they'll vomit, they'll throw up
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's so much of it in the
grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably, as humans, wouldn't be
exposed to as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are cases where poisoning has
occurred by fusarium mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we know nothing about what they
may be doing or if they're even present in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole focus has been primarily on
aspergillus, for better or for worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the regulatory agencies
decided was a priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we've written about it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the tests that we sell too,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is one of the few, if not the only,
contaminants on cannabis that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: shown to be actually fatal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for good reason that they were
testing for aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that's definitely the most
well-known.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes the aspergillosis in lungs of
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sometimes referred to as farmer's
lung disease because when farmers work
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot of hay, with a lot of barley
wheat, over years, they develop a
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity to the aspergillus spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, people that are
immunocompromised or have health
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, sometimes diabetes or even
have had organ transplants, they will be
[SPEAKER_01]: more susceptible to problems with
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, healthy
individuals, and I would consider myself
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy and you look pretty healthy to me,
I doubt either one of us would suffer from
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus unless we were smoking 12,
14 joints a day that had aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: In it, on a regular basis, we probably
wouldn't suffer from this unless we had
[SPEAKER_01]: some underlying conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you said, it can cause problems in
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any doubt, any concern,
it is flagged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspergillus is flagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were talking about different
species and everything, two that stood out
[SPEAKER_00]: to me that maybe you didn't mention or
maybe you didn't even find, powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: and botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Powdery mildew is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen it on buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it on buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a white moldy appearance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we were growing these on culture
media plates in the lab, that one doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually grow on the plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually fortunate or unfortunate
not on the radar for total yeast and mold
[SPEAKER_01]: testing because you can't test it,
you can't grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may see a bud that's almost white
covered in powdery mildew, it may pass
[SPEAKER_01]: because it doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Botrytis was an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see a lot of it growing on yeast
and mold plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see botrytis mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason, it's overgrown by
some of these other fungi, which in some
[SPEAKER_01]: ways leads to me to question some of these
yeast and mold testing assays that are
[SPEAKER_01]: done from a cultural perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you know when you do a yeast and
mold test that you're culturing everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's important from a disease
perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be missing, or you meaning the
person doing the test, may be missing
[SPEAKER_01]: certain species of fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think botrytis is one that's being
missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, it doesn't seem to want
to grow as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, does botrytis cause problems in
humans?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does produce some of these metabolites,
these mycotoxins that I referred to
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's not on the radar for
testing from a regulatory perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It skips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless it's super moldy, as you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's that bad, you don't want to sell
that product anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of the moldy strawberry analogy that
we always talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the grocery store and you see
strawberries that are covered in mold,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to say, well,
I guess it passed testing, so I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go on to a different
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting that the biggest mold on
strawberry is botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the one that tends to cause
strawberries to go bad if you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: eaten them in a couple of days,
is botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've probably been swallowing botrytis
spores for a very long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a good thing to bring up too.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of a total yeast and mold test,
is it really to protect the consumer from
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially getting sick, or is it more of
just a check on just good sanitation or
[SPEAKER_00]: hygienic processes that are going on in
the grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's both.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason it's flagged from a regulatory
or health perspective is because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that there are these reports from the
70s and 80s of aspergillosis occurring or
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus infections, sometimes in
patients that have smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a correlation there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how often is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it one in 100,000?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it one in 10,000?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have those numbers to say that
out of all the population of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers, a certain proportion will get
aspergillus infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess if one person gets it,
that's enough to raise a flag,
[SPEAKER_01]: a radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other yeasts and molds that are in
there that you and I are consuming,
[SPEAKER_01]: every day in our diet, whether it's a
strawberry or blueberry or some other
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh fruit, our bodies deal with it and
break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, we really don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we do these yeast and mold tests and
somebody comes to me and says,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got 20,000 or I got 40,000, I don't know
what that means from a health perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the health practitioners
know what that means either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, the more it is, the more the
chances of getting a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you told me that 20,000 is twice as
bad as 10,000, I wouldn't believe you
[SPEAKER_01]: because there is no data to support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if it's 100,000, I would say,
boy, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't have 100,000 CFUs in a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we put that on a petri dish,
that petri dish is covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see the petri dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just got so much mold on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that's not a great product itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you told me it's 40,000 versus 10,
I have no idea what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in Canada, we've set the limit at 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 seems to be a doable number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a reasonable number in that if you're
below 50, you probably have a product
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, other than the aspergillus
species, a product that's doable.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a sense, the body can deal with that
level of mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's less than that, so much the better
because it's getting closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting closer and closer to being
almost clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different states have set up different
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Massachusetts is probably up
around 100,000, others maybe less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Countries like Israel, where if you're
using cannabis for medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product has to be essentially
irradiated to make sure it's totally
[SPEAKER_01]: clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have data on what these numbers
actually mean in terms of a health
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's interesting that in Canada,
it's set at 50 because like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the States, it ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iowa, I believe, if you look on the map
that we have on our website, Iowa has it
[SPEAKER_00]: set at 10, literally 10 CFU, which seems
almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have Florida and I believe
Michigan and maybe Connecticut too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're up to 100,000 and everywhere in
between, but it's all orders of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny that Canada is like,
well, 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've always been known as a country
that tries to balance things out and make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that we're approaching things from a
reasonable perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never seen a cannabis flower come
in at zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never have seen a flower come in
at 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unreasonable to me to have
something that low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walking down the park to your car,
you've already inhaled more than 10 cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying 50 is reasonable,
but there has to be a number that says,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, we can deal with that from a grower
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we see 50,000 on flower, it's usually
a product that has been grown under very
[SPEAKER_01]: high humidity or it's during the peak of
summer where there's a lot of heat or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a flower that's had some damage done to it
because 50 is still a very high number to
[SPEAKER_01]: meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, most things should pass
50,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen maybe two to 3% of product get
rejected because it's been over 50,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good number to say that,
okay, below 50, things are probably going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 or 50 or 100 CFUs to me is very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impossible really because everything
out there has mold on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go back to what we were saying before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so much how much mold,
although that can be an indicator,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's what type is on there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you've set the limit at 50 like you
have in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had 40,000 CFUs of aspergillus,
that's much more concerning than if it
[SPEAKER_00]: were one of these other non-pathogenic
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, there are maybe three
groups of fungi that should be tested for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we decided we don't want to do
total CFUs anymore and we abandoned that
[SPEAKER_01]: approach and said, all right, we're just
going to target certain fungi that we know
[SPEAKER_01]: historically have had an importance for
humans and could potentially cause
[SPEAKER_01]: problems if they're present in flower or
on product.
[SPEAKER_01]: One would definitely be aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, because of the historical
significance of aspergillus, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody would argue that we should just
exclude it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be turning a blind eye to
reports of aspergillus causing disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know there's fusarium on cannabis and
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know fusarium causes major problems on
cereal and other crops because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the third is penicillium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, penicillium is a tough one because
there's so much of it and not all of it is
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned the cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got penicillium on your cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ate a little bit of moldy cheese,
you're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are going to target three organisms,
those would be the three.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of it, just ignore it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing those every day in our diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't caused a problem everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can find 30 to 40 different species of
yeast and mold on any given cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, out of which maybe two is
aspergillus and one might be fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, out of that list of 40,
I would only be concerned with three,
[SPEAKER_01]: those three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should just test for those
three and let the others be as they may
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of times growers use
beneficial products like trichoderma and
[SPEAKER_01]: glioclatium and other fungi that are
registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're allowed to be used on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can cause yeast and mold numbers so
high that the product fails.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're coming to me now and saying,
I've treated this product with
[SPEAKER_01]: trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't used any pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: This product is clean, but it's failing
because it's got huge numbers of spores of
[SPEAKER_01]: trichoderma, which has been found to be
okay for people to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a dilemma if we're testing just
total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're testing for aspergillus,
fusarium, and penicillium, the trichoderma
[SPEAKER_01]: one's going to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in the case of aspergillus,
probably because I'm more familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, that likely the regulation wouldn't be
just any form of aspergillus because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's all sorts of different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be those four pathogenic ones
that we had mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same case with penicillium and
fusarium that there's certain pathogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there's penicillium citrinum
is one species that's very, very common
[SPEAKER_01]: that produces a number of these
microtoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly in fusarium, there's a couple of
three species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gramenium is definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pseudogramenium, spore trochoides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just throwing these names out because
these are names that we know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't necessarily want to go after
every single fusarium that may be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be targeted towards the ones that
we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, you're looking at about O3 and
O36, maybe eight or nine specific fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: that are known to be harmful to humans
that have produced toxins, and we should
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The others, obviously, and then maybe set
a limit of let's say 50,000 total CFUs if
[SPEAKER_01]: we were going to use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything below that, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then test for these seven or eight,
like we do salmonella and E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't test for every bacteria that's
present.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some states, they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their total bacterial loads as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, like you said, those thresholds
are usually set pretty high, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't one that growers seem to struggle
with, but total yeast and mold is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did say that we were going to talk
about some of the factors that your team
[SPEAKER_00]: identified, so let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the major ones that you
identified that was in this paper was that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant genetics themselves play a huge
role in the TYM levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if you could speak a bit to that,
and is it specifically the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the plant and the flowers
that leads to that, or is there something
[SPEAKER_00]: else going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have something to do with
immunity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a bit of a surprise to us as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sort of glad we really included seven
or eight different types of genetics or
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypes in this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we were grabbing whatever we
could, whatever was being grown at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a planned experiment,
but we did find definite differences
[SPEAKER_01]: between the types of cannabis that were
being grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily, it's to do with the morphology
and the size of the flower structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larger the flowers, the bigger the
mass, if you wish, or volume, the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: the yeast and mold in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants that produce very small buds,
smaller buds, many of them, but smaller in
[SPEAKER_01]: size, not as dense, seem to have less of a
yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was definitely this physical
correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, I do think there were
chemical products, chemicals produced in
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower that would be inhibiting yeast
and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that because some of these flowers,
the yeast and mold was so low that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: almost impossible to explain just from the
fact that the flowers were small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were secreting some kind of a
chemical product, a natural chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: product that was preventing these yeast
and molds from growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we knew what those were, boy,
we'd be off to a really good start from a
[SPEAKER_01]: research perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, that's something that needs to
be looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's something like terpenes
or some of these other volatiles that we
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not THC or CBD because all
of these were producing THC, CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something else that perhaps isn't on
the radar yet, something that other
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers or breeders may want to look
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, flower structure, flower size.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason the larger flowers seem to have
more yeast and mold is the humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: the moisture in those flowers is higher by
three to four percent in terms of relative
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity than the outside air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their temperature builds up in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost a mini greenhouse sitting on a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It traps the solar radiation and it warms
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds warm up two, three degrees higher
than the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That humidity and moisture, the
temperature creates this little greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: that allows these yeast and molds to build
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we asked ourselves, well,
if you circulate the air, you turn a fan
[SPEAKER_01]: on close to the plants and let this air
infiltrate through the flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, the yeast and molds drop by 90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you can't go out and put a fan next
to every plant, but certainly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you increase your airflow, your air
movement, the humidity drops, the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature drops, and your flowers have
way less yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not impractical.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some greenhouses, you can set up eight
or 10 fans blowing in a certain direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will really reduce the yeast and
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine growers, too, would be
encouraged to hear you say that there
[SPEAKER_00]: could be something more than just the
morphology of the buds that's contributing
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, growers want big,
dense flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have that be associated with higher
TYM, well, that's not good news at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the chemicals are discovered,
which they will be, that will be very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very useful because that's a natural way
for the plant to protect itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, plants don't have an immune system,
but they do secrete many, many chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of these chemicals are known to
inhibit the growth of mold and bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding that strain or strains would be
very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or even putting that into a spray of
some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing that I saw in the paper,
too, is that in addition to the density
[SPEAKER_00]: and the size of the buds, the number of
leaves in the actual flower, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to that as well, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first time I've actually taken
an entire flower apart using a pair of
[SPEAKER_01]: forceps and scalpel, like a surgeon would.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the flower and cut it up into its
various components.
[SPEAKER_01]: All growers will know that we've got these
bracts, which are the inflorescence leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: that surround the center of that female
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, the more inflorescence leaves you
have, generally speaking, the higher your
[SPEAKER_01]: THC and CBD because the trichomes are
found in these little bracts surrounding
[SPEAKER_01]: the pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through and literally cut them all
out and started counting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larger buds had more of these
inflorescence leaves or bracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, because it provides protection
against the flower and it increases the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, the bigger flowers,
more total THC, more CBD, but also more of
[SPEAKER_01]: these inflorescence leaves are building up
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visualize a flower structure that's more
open, where air can filter through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got fewer leaves on the outside,
lower yield, definitely lower yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: but less yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want too small flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got no yeast and mold, but then
you've got no THC or CBD, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere there's a happy medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: For giving practical advice to growers who
are trying to lower their TYM,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of plant genetics, what should
they be thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should they be trying to select strains
that have certain morphology that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be more favorable for lower
levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should they be increasing their airflow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you advise?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the breeding part is still a ways
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there are growers that have made
correlations with certain strains are
[SPEAKER_01]: known to have higher yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the strains, incidentally,
that have high yeast and mold are also
[SPEAKER_01]: very sensitive to botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers know which strains they grow that
have botrytis bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can stay away from those because
those are the ones that are also going to
[SPEAKER_01]: build up higher yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go with your botrytis tolerant strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have a tendency to have lower
yeast and mold because the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: structure is much smaller, less dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, keep the airflow happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lower humidity is always good for both
botrytis and yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't leave a lot of leaf litter on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tendency to just cut leaves and
drop them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the leaves get dried out,
there's a ton of yeast and mold that
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally start to grow on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that disturbs that leaf litter on
the bottom will create some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: spores flying up to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowers are sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're producing resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've shown that if you have a lot of
yeast and mold in the air, they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: actually land on the flower and stick onto
that resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not inactivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those flowers, when they're taken to the
lab and tested for yeast and mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: may actually have higher levels because of
the fact that spores in the air were
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking to the surface of that resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something else to obviously be
aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: During harvest, don't create a lot of
activity around the plants in terms of too
[SPEAKER_01]: much shaking or too much jiggling because
that'll just create a spore dust,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you wish, that will land and stick to
the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as spray, sometimes people say,
well, can I spray zero tall or can I spray
[SPEAKER_01]: some product that's registered?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's a good idea because
you're increasing the humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: a moisture level in that flower,
particularly when it's closer to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, there's not much you can do from a
treatment perspective to bring those
[SPEAKER_01]: levels down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand too that a lot of it isn't so
much what happens during the growing of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, but it's in the post-harvest
activities, the drying, the curing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if you could speak a bit about
what you found around that activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another aspect that's super
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's leave the grower aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've picked up a whole batch of
harvested flower and now you're deciding,
[SPEAKER_01]: how am I going to trim this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want to do the standard wet trim
where you push all the flowers through
[SPEAKER_01]: into a trimmer and then dry the individual
buds or do you want to hang dry where
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is left intact and then the
moisture is taken out and then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: trim off your leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: We found a pretty big difference between
hang dry and wet trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wet trim creates some damage,
obviously, to the leaves and releases
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals or nutrients that a lot of moles
that might be present, particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: penicillium, start to feed on it and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even during the drying process,
you're seeing buildup of these moles in a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower that's been trimmed wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, when you dry this thing
first, you're not allowing these wound
[SPEAKER_01]: sites or broken off leaves as a source for
mold and yeast to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire flower structure is dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've eliminated 90% of your yeast and
mold and then when you start trimming it
[SPEAKER_01]: as a dry trim, we found that the yeast and
mold levels were way lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing that definitely will make
a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers are using the hang dry
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll probably find they don't have as
much issues with yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't look at anything beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, the curing process or the
packaging and storing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all growers know that when you
store inappropriate humidity or
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, you're going to get buildup
of yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that if you cure them too long
or under high moisture, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really look at that aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of stopped right at the point
where the flowers had been trimmed,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's wet or dry and then
collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any idea in terms of
percentage what growers are typically
[SPEAKER_00]: doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more common for them to be doing wet
trimming versus dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're shifting a lot towards dry trim
because it's less work in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can bring the flowers into the dry
rooms, hang them and then deal with them
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drying process itself is very
detrimental to yeast and mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is obviously a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have dry herbs and dry products,
dried figs, they tend to last a lot longer
[SPEAKER_01]: because the moisture is taken out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly with dried flower, the problem
is that you never get down to zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen a dried flower get down to
zero yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a fraction that still hangs
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That population can always build up later
on if the storage conditions aren't right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're coming in with a very high
yeast and mold load, then nothing you do
[SPEAKER_01]: after harvest is going to bring all of it
down to zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two components.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to reduce the yeast and mold while
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after you harvest and bring it in,
try to do things that will reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast and mold even further in that
product that you're handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to imagine that leaf litter too
would be a big consideration during the
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming process.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even having too many leaves on there can
create problems for not enough moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: drying and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang drying has to be done carefully
because you've got way more plant material
[SPEAKER_01]: and you want to make sure that all of it
gets down to, I don't know, 12 to 14
[SPEAKER_01]: percent moisture so that you're not
leaving remnants of yeast and mold even in
[SPEAKER_01]: the hang dry samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say over the year of study,
we looked at maybe, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: two to three thousand samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everything is done right, samples are
not too much yeast and mold in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, they're hang dried and
carefully handled.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the entire batch of 2,000 samples,
I would say the average yeast and mold was
[SPEAKER_01]: around 2,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,000 would be the average that you would
expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everything was done right, you brought
things in properly, they were hang dried
[SPEAKER_01]: and trimmed and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,000 is doable in most states and
definitely doable in most countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But never will it ever go down to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the hang drying and there
being kind of leaves and kind of creating
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the moisture environment that's
similar to what you were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: during growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that in mind, is it important to have
good air circulation when you're doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: hang drying as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we actually see an explosion of
yeast and mold when the plants first enter
[SPEAKER_01]: the drying room because there's so much on
there that they just start moving around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're right, get the airflow
happening, make sure it's a long process,
[SPEAKER_01]: seven days, five to seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the moisture out, measure the moisture
in there to make sure it's low enough
[SPEAKER_01]: before we take it out and start trimming
it for final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are pockets of yeast and mold in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen in some of the flowers,
for some reason, there's little pockets
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're looking at 10, 15,000 CFUs
per gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's dried properly, it should go
down to between two to five, I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: is a good number that anybody would be
happy with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, you're never gonna get
down to zero unless you maybe do some
[SPEAKER_00]: irradiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of experience you
have with that or if you have thoughts on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's sort of a touchy subject in
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's allowed in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're allowed to irradiate with E-beam
radiation I have looked at samples before
[SPEAKER_01]: and after from the perspective of yeast
and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much zero after it's been
irradiated.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it do to the final product?
[SPEAKER_01]: People that have used it would say that it
doesn't really alter too much of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may perhaps impact some of the
terpenes, but overall they're finding not
[SPEAKER_01]: a significant difference between
irradiated and not from an organoleptic
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really expensive to go through and
treat all the product unless you
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you're exporting and it's
a requirement for zero mold, then you
[SPEAKER_01]: would have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the article we published was
trying to address what are these other
[SPEAKER_01]: ways that could minimize your yeast and
mold levels without having to resort to
[SPEAKER_01]: things like irradiation afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I know there's different types
of irradiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which ones were you looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it ozone or?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we looked at electron beam radiation,
E-beam radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't looked at ozone.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have talked about ozone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also plasma, cold plasma
treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Israeli researchers have done good
studies on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've published a couple of papers on
different forms of radiation that are
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them do very similar results
to E-beam radiation that we've looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a cost factor and there's
also the handling factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta then take your products,
move them over to the site that's being
[SPEAKER_01]: treated, and then bring them back for
packaging and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, but it does seem like there's
hope here that if best practices are
[SPEAKER_00]: followed, then you should be able to
hopefully get underneath the threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as your state has set a realistic
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we haven't talked about outside
grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another story altogether because
you have so little control over the
[SPEAKER_01]: weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get rained on, if it's a series of
hot 100 degree weather with high humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's almost impossible to manage yeast and
mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have any suggestions or
recommendations there because I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: worked with outdoor grown cannabis in
terms of yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be definitely more challenging to
manage those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can tell you as someone who has
grown in the Northeast and had plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: finish in October, it can be very tough to
manage mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you know something just occurred
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there should be criteria for
regulations indoor cannabis versus outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's more leniency on the indoor
because you know that the yeast and mold
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure overall is going to be lower
indoors if everything's done the way it
[SPEAKER_01]: should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors, maybe that's a different
scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if the regulatory agencies
consider a method of production or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be some way to discriminate
indoor or differentiate, I should say,
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiate indoor grown versus outdoors
in terms of potentially having lower CFUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Sameer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to be very mindful of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already know that I'm going to be
putting a link to the paper in the show
[SPEAKER_00]: description for people to check out
because there's a ton more information in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that we didn't get a chance to get
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that, if you have any
other resources or research that you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to share with the folks and that I
can put links to, please let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, any ways that people
can maybe get in touch with you or follow
[SPEAKER_00]: the work that you're doing, please plug
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's an exciting field to be in
because there's so much to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea of exchanging information to
me is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that we're talking today is
because I want the information to get out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a good way of disseminating
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more we share, the more we know,
the more we understand, and the more we
[SPEAKER_01]: can manage these problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: These problems are not new.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been around for centuries since
the day cannabis was first grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect the yeast and mold tolerance was
much higher back then than it is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to know, we need to study,
and we need to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and we appreciate you coming on again,
Zamir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you'll be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't see you before CanMed,
I can't wait to see you down in Marco
[SPEAKER_00]: Island.
