[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot more about epilepsy since
this was more epilepsy focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned more about dosing and side

the fluctuations in the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got enlightened in a field that I
understand but am not as educated in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really honored to be here and be
able to meet all these incredible people
[SPEAKER_00]: and listen to these lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been amazing.
