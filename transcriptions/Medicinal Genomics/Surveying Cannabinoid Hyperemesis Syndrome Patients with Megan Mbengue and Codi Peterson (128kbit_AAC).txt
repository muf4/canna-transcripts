[SPEAKER_00]: Our guests today are Megan Bang and Cody
Peterson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Megan is the revolutionary force behind
Trusted Canon Nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: With over 10 years of nursing experience
in diverse fields like oncology,
[SPEAKER_00]: labor delivery, and hospice care,
she brings a unique perspective to her
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also holds national certifications in
three nursing specialties and a master of
[SPEAKER_00]: science degree in medical cannabis
therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cody is the chief science officer at the
Canigma and a practicing pharmacist with a
[SPEAKER_00]: passion for cannabis-based medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given his diverse pediatric pharmacy
experience and knack for educating,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cody aims to educate as many people as
possible about the medicinal potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cody and Megan have launched a new
IRB-approved survey through the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of California that aims to better
understand the signs, symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and challenges of cannabinoid hyperemesis
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to understand the key indicators
of this condition, hear about any remedies
[SPEAKER_00]: that work, and learn more about navigating
healthcare as a CHS patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you or someone you know has suffered
from CHS and are over 18, please take a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment to fill out their survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only will you be helping this vital
research, but participants will be entered
[SPEAKER_00]: into a drawing to win one of three $100
gift cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a link in the show description so
it's easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss an
overview of CHS symptoms, early symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: and a prodrome phase, clinical experiences
treating CHS patients, the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: causes of CHS, challenges in diagnosing,
and treatment and abstinence from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Megan and Cody, I'd like to thank this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's sponsor, Trusted Cana Nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trusted Cana Nurse was founded by Megan
Bang and Ariane Williams, two nurses who
[SPEAKER_00]: are dedicated to bridging the gap between
traditional medicine and the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They specialize in creating evidence-based
treatment plans for all ages that address
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic illnesses, treatment-resistant
conditions, mental health, autism,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at trustedcananurse.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Megan
[SPEAKER_00]: Bang and Cody Peterson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Megan and Cody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, I'm excited to talk to
you both about the mysterious cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperemesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longtime listeners of the podcast or
perhaps people who have checked out the
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed archive may be familiar with CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a couple episodes on it and I
know that Ethan Russo presented at CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 about some of the research that he's
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the first time we discussed it
at CanMed was back in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I remember correctly, we actually
kind of had a hard time filling that panel
[SPEAKER_00]: because the topic was still very new and
not a lot of people knew about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since then, awareness has increased,
but there are still a lot more questions
[SPEAKER_00]: than answers when it comes to CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thrilled that you guys are doing
the good work to try to better understand
[SPEAKER_00]: this condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that said, I always like to start
with the basics for folks who might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cody, would you please summarize CHS
and what we do know about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks again, Ben, for the
complimentary words.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people talking about this
topic because it's increasingly important
[SPEAKER_02]: because more and more patients are showing
up with this collection of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, it's kind of a pretty simple
list of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's uncontrollable, nausea-vomiting
episodes of that, so this lasting for
[SPEAKER_02]: hours or even days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see this associated with someone
who's using cannabis very regularly,
[SPEAKER_02]: oftentimes daily or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are refractory vomiting
condition that does not respond to normal
[SPEAKER_02]: antiemetics, but is often relieved by a
somewhat peculiar phenomenon that is hot
[SPEAKER_02]: showers or bathing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And talking very hot in the shower is the
only time they're getting relief from this
[SPEAKER_02]: very intense nausea feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sort of that little collection,
believe it or not, is the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_02]: what we know or what we're trying to call
CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of questions around that
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely repeating episodes of
intense nausea and vomiting doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: respond to other medicine, patients who
consume cannabis and might be relieved
[SPEAKER_02]: with hot baths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Megan, anything to add there?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kind of before we get into the
different things that we're curious about
[SPEAKER_00]: or that we're trying to uncover with CHS,
I was curious about the two of you being
[SPEAKER_00]: clinicians, your experience dealing with
patients who are kind of suffering from
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Megan, maybe you can start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you worked with patients suffering
from CHS and sort of what are those cases
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe have in common or what's unique in
what you've seen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into that, we'll plug the
study real quick that we are recruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: right now for our CHS survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a two part survey where people will
answer detailed, detailed questions on
[SPEAKER_01]: their CHS symptoms and their cannabis use
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know where we're going to post
the link, but we're recruiting for that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be in multiple places.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely put it in the show
description for this episode, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: so people can easily find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I see, oftentimes I see people in
the early stages of CHS in what's called
[SPEAKER_01]: the prodrome phase, which is phase one of
CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a phase that can last for
months, years, maybe even a decade or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And common symptoms of prodrome are waking
up with morning nausea, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of GI upset, heartburn,
just not feeling well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And alcohol intolerance is one that's
surprising, a surprising early symptom,
[SPEAKER_01]: but very common among CHS patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I get those people a lot that say
that they have these symptoms and
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes cannabis can help these
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wake up feeling nauseous,
they use their THC and then they feel
[SPEAKER_01]: better for a limited amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually this rolls into the
hypermetic phase and I'll let Cody expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we sort of touched on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of like what we're
characterized with, which is this intense
[SPEAKER_02]: nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, for no other reason,
when you come into the hospital where I
[SPEAKER_02]: see patients in the hypermetic phase,
they're not reaching out to me online,
[SPEAKER_02]: but rather I still work in a traditional
hospital setting as a pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing patients come in and
these intense bouts of vomiting kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: unaware of this unwellness or the cause of
this unwellness that Megan just described
[SPEAKER_02]: for extreme periods of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they come into the hospital,
we do what's called a full workup,
[SPEAKER_02]: we scan them, we check every potential
cause of nausea and vomiting, the top 20
[SPEAKER_02]: most common things that cause vomiting in
kids and none of them are, they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might find a little inflammation in
the belly or something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but generally almost nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes if they don't say anything
about their THC use, we don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we didn't do a urine screen,
we weren't looking for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I deal with kids, so they're under
18, so they might not be honest,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adults are also not telling their doctors
about their cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they go undiagnosed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we frequently see this with
patients with CHS as well as they get into
[SPEAKER_02]: this hyperamesis phase, they kind of
recover, they fall back into this
[SPEAKER_02]: unwellness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they have a GI doctor, they're in
the healthcare system, but we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they bounce back in this intense
vomiting, the right person or the right
[SPEAKER_02]: doctor or the right lab, those sort of
three things align and there's a light
[SPEAKER_02]: bulb moment like, ah, this is probably
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see this with some frequency.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look, I saw a patient definitively
with this condition last two nights ago in
[SPEAKER_02]: the hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then last night I was asked to come
see, check out a patient and assess
[SPEAKER_02]: whether they had CHS and it looked like
probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like there are times where this
isn't the diagnosis, but I'm seeing this
[SPEAKER_02]: more and more in-person myself,
who's a big skeptic, a huge proponent of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to demean the plant or
raise alarm bells, but the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: products, whether it's the THC itself or
something else in these products is
[SPEAKER_02]: causing this syndrome, this collection of
symptoms in an increasing amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: American citizens, our friends smoking
legal weed potentially, are getting sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and you touched on a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of cases are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that just because of a better awareness
where we're better able to identify it or
[SPEAKER_00]: is it potentially something else?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's evidence to say that well into
knowing about this disease, like 2005 is
[SPEAKER_02]: when it was first described.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this was actually first described in
Australia by a doctor who noticed this in
[SPEAKER_02]: these patients who had been consuming a
lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Word kind of slowly spread and we've seen
more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a lot of lack of awareness
and there's still a lot of stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're seeing both sides of the coin of
over-diagnosing and under-diagnosing,
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of awareness or lack of sharing,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all kind of swirling to make a bad
situation for patients who are just really
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to understand why they're sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of them have no idea that it's
their cannabis, which they believe to be
[SPEAKER_02]: highly medicinal and have very little
negative effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the case for the vast majority
of our patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for some reason, and Ethan Russo,
you kind of alluded to maybe for genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons, there seems to be some patients
who just cannot tolerate cannabis in large
[SPEAKER_02]: doses over long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't fully understand why yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was glad that you brought it up,
Megan, about sort of these early warning
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of CHS and it seems like you've
described them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when patients come to you with that,
sort of what is your advice or a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of prevent them from getting to the
hyperametic stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first I ask a lot of questions on
what does their use look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long have they been using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me more about your symptoms and what
you're feeling and what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them have like almost
textbook exact same story.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been using for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wake up with morning nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis helps a little bit in the
interim.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've seen 10 different doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been treating with two different,
three different GI medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done all the scans.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done, ruled everything out.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one seems to know what's actually
causing their illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just belly pain or the
emesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this overall malaise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the prodromal phase is not fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't feel well, even though
they're not in the vomiting phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those individuals who haven't figured
out that it's the cannabis they're
[SPEAKER_02]: consuming daily or near daily is what most
it seems have developed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although there's some variability there
that we're trying to tease apart in our
[SPEAKER_02]: study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how often are individuals developing
this consuming?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it once a week or does it seem like
everybody's consuming multiple times a
[SPEAKER_02]: day?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are they smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: High CBD flower or is it mostly high THC
products?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you getting your products in the
dispensary or are you growing your own?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many questions that we
don't have at least even like wait to,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just sort of opinion that we've heard
on the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were really trying to put some
weight to that and help guide doctors and
[SPEAKER_02]: inform patients about what could be going
on with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the, one of the really
interesting nuances of this syndrome is
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's not, is how the THC can help in
the interim, but it's when patients get
[SPEAKER_01]: towards, you know, not consuming,
they like, maybe that's because they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've either been sleeping or they go on
vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when the symptoms tend to start
to rev up and they start to have like the
[SPEAKER_01]: nausea, the GI distress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cody, what else do we see?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we see that in oftentimes like days
two to three of abstinence from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which kind of that, that rebuts the whole
neem oil pesticide thing that like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: absence of that we're seeing these
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the other two things that are
pretty commonly seen and yes, sometimes in
[SPEAKER_02]: the morning, not exclusively by any means
are in thermo dysregulation, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: fancy way of saying my temperature is
fluctuating a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel hot and cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sweaty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, you know, flush, but not feeling,
not being able to regulate that normally
[SPEAKER_02]: and intense anxiety, abnormal anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, you're kind of like,
your heart's already racing in the morning
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're already doom and gloom and
stressed about your day, but you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: started like, and that's not normal for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some individuals that that is actually
just their norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, it, when it, when it's not,
then it's, is another, I think kind of low
[SPEAKER_02]: level dysregulation alarm.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I would call most of what Megan has
described in the pro drone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's speculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't fully understand the condition,
but we know there's a dysregulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see these cycles of nausea and
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know there is a weight being put on the
scale, which is a cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, usually as far as we know,
high THC cannabis products and trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out how would we push on that scale
at all comes out to this vomiting
[SPEAKER_02]: condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to pick apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are theories that it's not the
THC, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have heard the one you've heard the most
Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, pesticides, neem oil, pesticides,
neem oil specifically, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I would say for a lot of
weed people, we like natural things,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Neem oil is extremely natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the, you know, it is the actual oil
from a tree nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, a tree, maybe just a tree
pulp, but either way, from the neem tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you know, there's not a lot of
evidence here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethan Russo very definitively,
you know, puts his, his, uh, line in the
[SPEAKER_02]: sand here and says, this doesn't look
like, uh, and I'm going to mispronounce
[SPEAKER_02]: the active ingredient in neem,
but this doesn't look like that toxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I talked to, you know,
uh, toxicologists and emergency physicians
[SPEAKER_02]: who I work with closely, it doesn't really
look like acute pesticide toxicity in
[SPEAKER_02]: almost all the forms in which we know
because the response to the toxin is not
[SPEAKER_02]: immediate, which is almost always the
case, especially if you're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and so, you know, it would be
very weird to have repeating episodes in
[SPEAKER_02]: this cyclical nature every couple of
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is correlated with potentially
your menstrual cycle or stressful events,
[SPEAKER_02]: or whether you drink alcohol, it just
doesn't, it doesn't totally line up with
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't even say totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't line up with a traditional
toxin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is in being intoxicated by a
substance or being impaired, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: having that poison in your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's a lot of reasons it
doesn't look like neem, but I'm open
[SPEAKER_02]: minded.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could definitely be increasing
amount of pesticides in our cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to study that, but it would be a
little naive to call it pesticides when we
[SPEAKER_02]: know some patients smoking what is
presumed to be clean cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an argument to be made about what
the definition of it is, but legally
[SPEAKER_02]: purchased.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulated cannabis who are still
developing HHS, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So then if I look at what's in that
product and I can definitively say there's
[SPEAKER_02]: not very much of any of this other stuff,
but there seems to be a lot of one
[SPEAKER_02]: particular thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing is THC and it tends to be the
warmest, you know, uh, in, in a doctor's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, that's probably the thing that's
causing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that exists in 30%, not less
than 0.05% because it's under the
[SPEAKER_02]: detectable limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occam's razor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the most logical explanation is
typically the right one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I want to point out, so my
expertise is in the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing a talk on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of them in the next, in the next two
months at either MJ, uh, unpacked in
[SPEAKER_02]: Missouri or at, um, society cannabis
clinicians in Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this system.
[SPEAKER_02]: This system is homeostatic regulatory
system connecting all of the other systems
[SPEAKER_02]: in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Including the adrenal system, which we
know is just disrupted in the ECS,
[SPEAKER_02]: including your thermoregulatory system,
which we know as I've related,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's related to your GI motility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's related to your pain sensitization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's related to your, again, heat
sensitization, your hot baths and hot
[SPEAKER_02]: shower complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can explain away without even with much
of a stretch how THC interacting with CB1
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors could dysregulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not just CB1, but the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could dysregulate in a way that could
explain almost all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and so for me, that is the
warmest theory, but we need real science.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a theory and a loose one of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even a hypothesis or maybe it's a
hypothesis and not a theory either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the lowest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, but we need to do this work and
we need to start with asking the right
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is the right question is, is this what
pesticide toxicity looks like?
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is almost a resounding no,
especially when you consider the hot
[SPEAKER_02]: baths.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen anybody get exposed to
organophosphates at a farm in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Sacramento, where they rush into
the hospital and place into a warm bath.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and we, you kind of touched on other,
you know, hyper emetic type of conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: that may sometimes be misdiagnosed as CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I'm curious in those cases are the
hot baths helpful for other sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: similar conditions, or is that very much
unique to CHS?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't use the word very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to take it back again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do this, uh, as part of a program
or a part of a project in grad school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, their CVS is like the
umbrella.
[SPEAKER_01]: CHS is a subset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sicklic vomiting syndrome is the big term
for conditions like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then CHS is a subsection within that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with CVS, oftentimes that's not
related to cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes it's related to childhood
stressors or traumas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how like the stress manifests
in kids and teens is sicklic vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And THC cannabis helps those with CVS and
it doesn't make it worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like a big differentiating
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some evidence that hot showers
can help those with CVS, but it is like
[SPEAKER_01]: predominantly like it's CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one of the pillars of,
of the syndrome itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think just to circle back and I
guess rephrase, cause I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got hot baths and showers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not common that people would do that
for nausea, vomiting, but it's not also
[SPEAKER_02]: unheard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel unwell, you're going to go take a
hot bath and feel a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just throwing that out there for not
even sick with vomiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some people would argue you can feel
better from a hot bath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now these patients report a significant
difference from I want to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so nauseous to, I can tolerate life on
this realm, you know, and it's like a big
[SPEAKER_02]: stark difference, but setting that aside,
sickly vomiters, which Megan alluded to,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't fully understand, but it's
definitely associated with childhood
[SPEAKER_02]: stressors and traumas, but there's a,
there's a imbalance or a dysregulation of
[SPEAKER_02]: the, of the, the systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now those individuals are still hard to
treat, but we do treat them with
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional anti-emetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They typically respond more to the Zofran,
the serotonin blockers that we give
[SPEAKER_02]: normally.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is like Megan said,
almost all of them will have developed
[SPEAKER_02]: this condition before they started smoking
cannabis, because it is a childhood or
[SPEAKER_02]: like teen developing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it can happen in adults too,
but, but I'm trying to speak in
[SPEAKER_02]: generalities.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see earlier and these
patients often report benefit from THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: but don't forget, Megan mentioned that a
lot of patients who develop CHS also get
[SPEAKER_02]: some benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I've got a patient, who has got a
sickly vomiting disorder, who smokes
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, who says it makes them feel
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the doctor is like, oh, this could be
CHS, especially if they don't know that
[SPEAKER_02]: patient or know their history very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a misdiagnosis there,
even though they're not taking hot baths,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's because the THC showed up in their
urine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a cross confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, I want to say to differentiate
around the hot baths.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a paper that suggests,
yes, that's a good indicator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen another paper more recently
that suggested actually both cyclic
[SPEAKER_02]: vomiters and cannabinoid hyperemesis
sufferers both find some relief from hot
[SPEAKER_02]: baths, which sort of mutes out that as a
diagnostic factor, only making the job
[SPEAKER_02]: more challenging, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like truly identifying which condition
we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the weed that's causing the
condition or does this patient have an
[SPEAKER_02]: underlying condition in which weed is
helping them, but they have the same
[SPEAKER_02]: vomiting problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cyclic vomiters don't typically have
prodromal symptoms in the same way that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that CHSers do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I think headache, if I recall
correctly, is a more common precursor to a
[SPEAKER_02]: cyclic vomiting episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it can happen before a CHS episode
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a clear picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the hot bathing too, I think with
CHS it's like, it's labeled as like
[SPEAKER_01]: pathological hot bathing, like,
like people will burn their skin,
[SPEAKER_01]: get second, third degree burns on their
skin from needing to be in the scalding
[SPEAKER_01]: hot showers for long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen some pretty severe cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the average person isn't doing
that, but they will rack up a $500 gas
[SPEAKER_02]: bill or, you know, water bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just run the water all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't, parents will be like,
we cannot get him out of the bath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he won't come out in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're late for school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all the things because the showers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is total abstinence from THC a
solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it is the textbook solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, how in your experience, um,
with abstinence, uh, how do you people do?
[SPEAKER_02]: It leaves some to be desired, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Megan, have you ever seen,
I'm sure you've seen patients go
[SPEAKER_02]: abstinence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever seen anybody, you know,
not go abstinent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, all the time people continue
to, to use, um, not believing their
[SPEAKER_02]: diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or that they feel like they can still
continue to use low amounts and manage
[SPEAKER_01]: their symptoms that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but for the, like, that is
interestingly, like one of the only
[SPEAKER_01]: published criteria for CHS is,
you know, that symptoms, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms, symptoms go away after six
months of abstinence, then it's likely
[SPEAKER_01]: that you had CHS six months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but it is, you know, if it's like
the presumed cause, then taking away the
[SPEAKER_01]: cause is likely going to be the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that for some reason that
pisses a lot of people off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're actually getting at the root
cause of this and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no cure for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you take away the cause of it,
which is, uh, that's an interesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, paradigm that I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, but yeah, it's, um, that really
is the only, the only known thing to help
[SPEAKER_01]: with CHS and it's recovery is a roller
coaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you stop using and then you
go away and you know, stopping use can
[SPEAKER_01]: then trigger episodes down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and people are using their
cannabis to stop an episode from happening
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they stop using and then it
triggers an episode or they have stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: using for a couple of months and then they
eat some food that triggers them or
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol or a stressful event triggers a
CHS episode and they haven't used in three
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're covering- Now they don't think
they have CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this dysregulation or this
imbalance sort of lingers in our system
[SPEAKER_02]: for an extended period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patients sometimes reporting 12 months
before they feel whole again, from a GI
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, the damage in the the
inflammation that went on during there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you remember people suffered for years
without knowing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people on these discussion
boards that suffered for 15 years with a
[SPEAKER_02]: condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd seen every doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been taking medicine and had
all the scopes and done everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the, where did it, how did I get
on this point, Megan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, recovery being a roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so what I always counsel my patients
on is like, you know, like patient
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday hadn't consumed cannabis in nine
days and she was in the middle of an
[SPEAKER_02]: episode and it was triggered, you know,
at Disneyland from a hot burrito,
[SPEAKER_02]: a birria taco or something of this effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what set her off into,
into this, this problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't, you know, um, we don't fully
know what the timeline looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to ask you questions about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take our survey or you send this to
your friend, we're going to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long after you quit, did you have
symptoms?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can tell you in my personal,
um, you know, practice experience,
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not a CS CHS sufferer, but in my
experience, talking to patients that have
[SPEAKER_02]: it, we're seeing, um, easily seven days,
usually 21 to 30 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes 60 plus days of,
Oh, I just had an episode again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't know maybe it was a stress,
like Megan said, maybe it was some weird
[SPEAKER_02]: food.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you thought you could try again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it made you sick a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know, but we're trying to put
that together so we can use that to
[SPEAKER_02]: educate patients, help them know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause physicians aren't telling patients
to, I shouldn't say any, most physicians
[SPEAKER_02]: are not, not telling folks that,
Hey, you might have more vomiting over the
[SPEAKER_02]: next few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should expect to have more vomiting
over the next few days, even though I
[SPEAKER_02]: believe you and you quit three days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that conversation is not over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause physicians aren't aware enough or
frankly, the data doesn't help them right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of evidence for them to
lean on and say, Oh yeah, most patients
[SPEAKER_02]: will have another episode in the next 21
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what, again, the survey is
trying to give them some info to lean on,
[SPEAKER_02]: to more quickly and definitively know sort
of how to categorize and then how to treat
[SPEAKER_02]: as opposed to throw in a label on
something, throw in an anti-psychotic to
[SPEAKER_02]: help get them out of the emergency room
and sending people on their merry way,
[SPEAKER_02]: which unfortunately happens more often
than not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's, that's new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, done a few episodes on this
and seen some CanMed talks on it and
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously seen other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize the roller coaster of
recovery there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, you know, you, you abstain
your, your symptoms go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting that other things
can sort of trigger it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, not that I'm a clinician,
but my thought with that, and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me if I'm on the right track is,
you know, other things are interfacing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the endocannabinoid system,
not just cannabinoids and other things
[SPEAKER_00]: can, can kind of cause spikes in your
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think that's perhaps what's
going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like certain stressors, triggers can sort
of just dysregulate that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: One point of that is that oftentimes
people in recovery some people will
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise and work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes that can trigger
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we know what exercise does
to our ECS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people are told to like,
yeah, exercise, but don't go overboard
[SPEAKER_01]: because you don't want to trigger
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cody, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that part of the
endocannabinoid system's role is to chase
[SPEAKER_02]: the circadian rhythm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing this weird sort of
morning presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, there's not good data on how
many people are having this morning is
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned in the literature, but how many
is unclear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hoping to get some hands on that,
but the ECS naturally follows the cortisol
[SPEAKER_02]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as cortisol comes up, the ECS comes up
and turns it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if your ECS isn't working and the
cortisol is running out of control,
[SPEAKER_02]: and now you've got this sort of in
balance, we see this almost every day,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, is what I'm getting at on a micro
scale on a macro scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went someone been reporting their
menstrual periods, which we know there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatic shift in endocannabinoids and
function throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, you know, reproductive track,
just like so many, again, like ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of tease it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think there are things we can do
outside of THC, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that interact with our ECS,
but very few are as powerful of a hack as
[SPEAKER_02]: sucking down the plant medicine out of a
battery 18 times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't think no amount of
meditation we'll be able to sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: replicate that sort of stimulus to the
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I, I still tend to lean
towards like, yes, there are things that
[SPEAKER_02]: happen, but the ECS is highly dynamic and
it's working real hard, even when you
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke weed all day to keep you in balance,
in check, awake when you're supposed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: sleeping, when you're not, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if it just doesn't have the muster
and that's maybe what's leading to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to the, this dysregulation, you know,
sort of a suppression of the natural ECS
[SPEAKER_02]: because of too many phyto cannabinoids,
then it seems pretty obvious that
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment would then lean towards trying
to restore balance without the
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction of that phyto cannabinoid,
this very powerful modulator of this
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to, and I wanted to finish where
Megan was going, and I'm so glad I just
[SPEAKER_02]: remembered, is to like, what cannabis can
you use, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absence is, look, I tell all my patients,
the textbook answer is you got to quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the truth is I, you definitely have to
quit for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the future holds for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can assure you what you're doing right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to do this again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, you, you don't get to go and
just consume cannabis willy nilly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it doesn't have an effect on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We now know you're for lack of,
or just using poor terms, a carrier,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of, you have this genetic makeup,
you have this disposition and therefore if
[SPEAKER_02]: and when you decide to go back to
cannabis, know that this is a risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're dealing with right now is a
very much a risk and you're going to need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be aware of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause remember those symptoms that you had
five, six days ago, that was your body
[SPEAKER_02]: telling you that we got a problem and you
didn't listen or just as an example,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, I think there's a
conversation to be had that is,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, well, you know, this or there's a risk
and, uh, therefore you shouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be like somebody who contracted an
STD and you told them, Hey, no more sex
[SPEAKER_02]: for you buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff's dangerous, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of teaching them mitigation
factors, acknowledging that we're humans
[SPEAKER_02]: and potentially that that person had,
was deriving substantial medical benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: from cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where they started,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't just start consuming cannabis
all day because they were bored.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure there's a couple of
examples that most people are using it
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're anxious because they're
dealing with pain because they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're dealing with, uh, the stressors of
this crazy, you know, modern world we live
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, to deny them of any cannabis
medicine is challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there might be hope for
other cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, if you're listening and you have
CHS or you're, you know, you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're hearing about this, we want to hear
about what you've tried that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you change to?
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what has, you know, not set you off
because we know people are doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm willing to bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope the data shows this probably
half or floating this, like I don't fully
[SPEAKER_02]: accept, or I know that I have CHS,
but I still live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I did want to sort of talk,
so we talked about the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the contaminants and you know,
whether or not that's, that's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Positive factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there are contaminants in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they can cause certain
illnesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not convinced that this collection of
symptoms that we're talking about here
[SPEAKER_02]: today is that, you know, I think people
are getting sick from contaminants,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's in hemp converted products,
or whether it's in pesticide written legal
[SPEAKER_02]: products that are even in regulated
markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just not what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about this very specific set
of symptoms of hyperemesis and prodrome
[SPEAKER_02]: that doesn't line up with a typical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toxidone.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's much more likely that this is a
cause of high doses of THC, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so talk a bit about sort of,
I mean, what patterns you've seen in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of like, what's the route of
administration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are these people consuming
concentrates versus flour edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen any studies on this,
Megan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like have you, um, I have not seen
studies, but I do have lots of anecdotes
[SPEAKER_01]: of people who come to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is exactly what we are,
this survey is for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is to tease this apart, but I,
the people who come to me will say either
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been smoking for a decade or two or
three or five, um, usually smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I've been using concentrates for a much
shorter period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's what I have seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they start to develop those six
months, one year, two years for
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates, as opposed to this decade
that you feel like you're most of your
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Megan and I have talked about this,
so I kind of knew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's interesting that in teens,
the teens that Cody has worked with more
[SPEAKER_01]: teens than I have, but the few teens that
I have seen has been like a short,
[SPEAKER_01]: short period of time of using
concentrates, like two to three months of
[SPEAKER_01]: using concentrates, go on vacation and
then start to have CHS like symptoms with
[SPEAKER_01]: the prodrome in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds shorter than average.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not denying that it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, that individual may be
more predisposed from a genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we know that there's at least six,
uh, mutations that Ethan was able to
[SPEAKER_02]: identify, you know, just in his
preliminary relatively small studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to learn more as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think what we've seen in data,
so I'm trying to reach back in 2019,
[SPEAKER_02]: you had Alice Moon on in your,
your, uh, guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in 2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was my class president at U Maryland.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a, a online education on,
on CHS and we had Alice as our guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alice was able to present her survey data
that she had done, um, which ended up not
[SPEAKER_02]: ever being published.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she recently collaborated on a new
study that should be published soon out of
[SPEAKER_02]: UCLA, looking very similar to what we're
doing, which is great because we got to
[SPEAKER_02]: get more data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one study is nothing like we need
robust, um, decision support.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm getting at is Alice shared her
data back then with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when she showed us, she did show that
the majority of consumers had been smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: greater than three years, sorry,
inhaling cannabis for greater than three
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, there was a mixed collection,
the vapers, dabbers, and the smokers,
[SPEAKER_02]: they all had sort of developed it,
but very few had been edible only people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very even last had been CBD people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's a couple of other distinctions
in her data that were interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that's the one that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very clear in her data collected
from like two or 300 patients that she
[SPEAKER_02]: personally interviewed because she was
afflicted by this condition and no one was
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time someone would express to her
that she had CHS, she would send them her
[SPEAKER_02]: survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, she would collect that data and,
uh, you know, it was enough to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to kick Alice off as, as to be a powerful
voice and advocate in this space,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I, which I'm happy she, she's able
to be, you know, she's taken a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: kicks and jabs, um, for her role.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's representative of the
stigma that the community gives off to
[SPEAKER_02]: many patients of like the patients don't
want to share that they've developed an
[SPEAKER_02]: intolerance to the medicine that they
loved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that their friends consume every
day and their friends would not understand
[SPEAKER_02]: or say they're making it up or telling
them that it's not what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neem oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're smoking the wrong weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stigma is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to measure that in the
study too excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, we're pushing it out like this
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all, if you're listening to this survey,
we're pushing out, which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause this thing has been, I don't want to
say it, throw it in my side.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been my baby, but this thing needs to
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk more about the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are listening here and
they're curious about whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a good fit or who you're looking
for, talk about, you know, who should be
[SPEAKER_00]: participating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, Megan, me, um, our, our,
uh, principal investigator, Dr. Ariana
[SPEAKER_02]: Nelson, uh, UCI, uh, where this,
this study has been, uh, submitted and
[SPEAKER_02]: approved through their IRB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we are looking specifically for just
really simply uh, two criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, are you an adult?
[SPEAKER_02]: We need 18 or older.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's just too much, uh,
complexity in trying to get this info from
[SPEAKER_02]: kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we can start to uncover more
about pediatrics later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need you to be an adult who either
has been diagnosed with CHS or is believes
[SPEAKER_02]: they're suffering with CHS, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need you to be diagnosed by a
doctor, but we need you to kind of think
[SPEAKER_02]: like, this is, this is what I'm pretty
sure what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we're going to, we got a litany of
questions, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's two parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each part is going to take you about 25
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do recognize, but to make it more
valuable for you, you will be entered when
[SPEAKER_02]: you complete the survey into a raffle for
a hundred dollar gift card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're leaning towards Amazon,
but not to brand drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but we're going to, we're still
figuring out where, where that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, it's, we're really excited
to drop this two part survey to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: both the symptoms and use patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the burden, how much
healthcare, you know, how, how hard has
[SPEAKER_02]: this been on you and your family in the
[SPEAKER_02]: process of trying to discover that all of
this inflammation was because your
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system was out of balance
because you've been smoking too much
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis or marijuana, as they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, so we talked about before sort of
that early stage, uh, pro, pro dromal is
[SPEAKER_00]: the syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now people who are listening to this
and think, Oh, that's kind of sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is, are you interested in those
folks too, or, or only kind of in the
[SPEAKER_00]: later stages?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're looking for individuals who've
experienced, uh, hyperemesis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand that they're what Megan
and I talked about, which again,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're trying to understand better too,
as part of the study, but what we talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about is that early sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen that, but those are not
necessarily the patients we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we want to understand more about
your hyper emetic phase and what might've
[SPEAKER_02]: changed leading up to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, for those folks, I would encourage
you to, um, go read about cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: hyper emesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would encourage you to go understand it
more and not to freak out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also had people who are so anxious
about developing this, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't want to get this,
cause cannabis is so helpful to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unlikely that it's going to happen,
but what's the most definitive factor is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be, um, thoughtful or conscious
or mindful cannabis use as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: continuous all day, you know, use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people need cannabis all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people prefer cannabis all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and in individuals who prefer
cannabis all day and develop CHS,
[SPEAKER_02]: the truth of the matter is, is we probably
can't make that, that decision that way
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I wanted to acknowledge that
medical patients very much need right to
[SPEAKER_02]: get through their day, CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, some of those
individuals have developed, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: CHS as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got to fight through how do we
switch the pharmaceuticals or how do we
[SPEAKER_02]: change your cannabinoids to try to do
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot to learn, but right now
those who have CHS or those who believe
[SPEAKER_02]: they have CHS, but that we would look for
specifically for people who have had an
[SPEAKER_02]: episode of hyperemesis just so we can get
the most understanding of their path
[SPEAKER_02]: through the, through the hospital system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, for anybody who's
experienced what you just described,
[SPEAKER_02]: those prodrominal symptoms, but you,
you're not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be really reflective on the way
cannabis feels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be time to take a tolerance break
and see how you feel in five to seven
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be astounded, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it could be a really, really
powerful experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and if you happen to develop
hyperemesis while you try to stop THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: I need you to take my survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, just I'm teasing, but seriously,
because we, this is another one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: leading, not leading, but like,
this is another idea that we've kicked
[SPEAKER_02]: around as a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, knowing that we see this
sort of withdrawal induced, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, it makes sense in the, in the
setting of like dysregulation,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's all out of whack and it's gotten
used to having the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you pull that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the system is out of whack again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that might be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, that's, that's full
speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Cody and Megan, thank you so much
for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, again, we're going to put the link to
the survey in the show description so that
[SPEAKER_00]: people can find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, anyone listening,
please spread the word, let people know
[SPEAKER_00]: that this survey is out there and that you
should be participating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but before I let you go, I'm going to
let you both, um, share any other
[SPEAKER_00]: additional resources, uh, around this
topic that you think might be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, information about
yourself and how folks can maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, get in touch or connect with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the, one of the fascinating
places to actually learn about this in
[SPEAKER_01]: real time, we get a lot of flack for this,
but it's the Facebook groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the online CHS Facebook groups where
you get real time anecdotes from people
[SPEAKER_01]: and their experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that has triggered what we
are putting in the survey and how we have
[SPEAKER_01]: asked the questions in the survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a fantastic place for people to
not only like learn about it as clinicians
[SPEAKER_01]: and cannabis consumers, but to share their
experience and get advice from peers on
[SPEAKER_01]: what has helped them, how long their
symptoms lasted, because it's so nuanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Facebook groups are one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's one that that's called,
what is Katie's group called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's run by a nurse friend and
colleague of ours who's working with us on
[SPEAKER_01]: the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: A safe space to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a purple, um, you know,
purple on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's, she's a nurse and she helps
people directly, you know, going through
[SPEAKER_01]: their CHS episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a fantastic resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, trusted Canoners.com obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't, we typically refer
people out to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people are wanting to like stop the
cannabis use and kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, if they need help with that
part of it, then we talked about this last
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we do microdosing psilocybin
for, to help them desire cannabis less.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the immediate hypermetic phases,
that's where like Katie is a fantastic
[SPEAKER_01]: resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our study as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to be one of our authors and
it's going to help us get this into those
[SPEAKER_02]: communities on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so first I want to speak to anyone who
listened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for making it this far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know that you may or may not more
than likely just statistically,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have CHS, but you could share
this podcast and you can share our poster,
[SPEAKER_02]: which will be shared in this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to any of my pages.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would mean a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, we're trying to get this out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more people we talk to, the better
data we get, the better we can lead
[SPEAKER_02]: physicians to not make some of these
standard mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more we can help patients to
understand what to expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many benefits and really no
downside.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you gotta do is share.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just gotta say, Hey, weed is really
cool, but it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you can also call me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say this guy thinks he knows all about
this CHS stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't know anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go tell them what you really experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them it's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share it anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, other than that, um, you know,
I've got a YouTube video on CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to hear more, just sort of
like my solo preach to just Google my
[SPEAKER_02]: name, CHS, and you'll find a YouTube
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the other thing is, uh, Ethan Russo,
we talked about him already.
[SPEAKER_02]: His website, what dash is dash CHS,
um, is a place where you can purchase a,
[SPEAKER_02]: a DNA test to see if you have one of these
mutations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's also some facts and a useful
resource and education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you can check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, when we maybe drop the
paper, we'll come do another podcast show
[SPEAKER_02]: up at Can Med, do a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you both down at Can Med in
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, either talking about this or any of
the other great work that you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, thanks again for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having us.
Thanks for having us.
Thanks for having us.
