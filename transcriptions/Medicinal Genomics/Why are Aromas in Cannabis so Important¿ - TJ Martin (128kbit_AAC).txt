[SPEAKER_00]: Why aromas are so important to cannabis
and why they're important to you and your
[SPEAKER_01]: team at abstracts Yeah, so cannabis aroma
is really I mean they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for driving that consumer
experience so when consumers are
[SPEAKER_01]: purchasing Whether that be concentrates
vape pens flower pre-rolls They're maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: buying these based on how they like how it
smells and tastes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And understand more about why it smells
the way it does and tastes the way it does
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to understand more about the
chemistry behind these aromas and
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding this research is really
important to us as a company because we
[SPEAKER_01]: have an extraction facility Obviously,
we create flavor and terpene blends for
[SPEAKER_01]: various customers, but also just really
were curious to see like Why does when we
[SPEAKER_01]: understand why OG smells skunky and gassy,
but why now do GMOs smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Garlicy and savory why do zittles and runs
and all the other exotics tangies smell
[SPEAKER_01]: fruity tropical Gassy oranges like where
are all these smells and aromas coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from and can we start correlating the
chemistry?
[SPEAKER_01]: to the human sensory aspect because And as
a company when we start we work on this
[SPEAKER_01]: for about two three years now before we
published it But really is around like I
[SPEAKER_01]: think November 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started seeing regulatory's agencies
come out with New regulation stating that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis was not fruity or sweeter and
savory, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: we've seen this in California and This
isn't this wasn't anything malicious,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just because there was no data and
information showing that out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace testing labs couldn't really
test for it and There's no publications
[SPEAKER_01]: and so we knew we had all this data in
house We're working towards this
[SPEAKER_01]: publication like hey, we really need to
tell the story right and show people that
[SPEAKER_01]: hey there is more to the plant than We may
understand at this time that we know why
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells and taste to grape eat,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does GDP have that grape note?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blackberry kush have those dark berry
notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand the chemistry is behind this
and this is empowering important powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: information not only for regulators people
doing cultivation genetic like breed
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic breeding Extraction the whole
gambit of the industry could benefit from
[SPEAKER_01]: this information because then you can
utilize this to better improve products
[SPEAKER_01]: and consumer experiences and when you look
at publications like Addy Ray and Ethan
[SPEAKER_01]: Russo's publication they're looking at and
they show that the consumer experience at
[SPEAKER_01]: how much how good that experience is for
the consumer how positive it is was
[SPEAKER_01]: correlated to how Positive they perceive
the aroma to be right So understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: more of this is going to help give better
experiences to not only existing consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: but new entry consumers coming into the
industry who may be interested to try
[SPEAKER_01]: canvas Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm glad you brought up 80 Ray and
her Her study there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a guest on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a link to that one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can really go down the rabbit hole
But yeah, that was really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: where yeah, she would have folks in the
study smell different types of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and rate how how How good they thought
they smelled and then actually consume it
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of rate their experience and saw
a correlation where if you liked it The
[SPEAKER_00]: way it smelled you tended to like the
experience which was pretty pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful 100% right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it just going to show that
understanding more about why it smells and
[SPEAKER_01]: tastes the way it does is super important
for whole wide-ranging different product
[SPEAKER_01]: types and our understanding in this
industry and Trying to again empower
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers to make more educated decisions
and get better experience of the products,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean a lot of people who've been either
in the industry or consume cannabis A lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people have bad experiences and bad
stories, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if we have more education and more
understanding what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can avoid those circumstances and those
those bad experiences You
You You
