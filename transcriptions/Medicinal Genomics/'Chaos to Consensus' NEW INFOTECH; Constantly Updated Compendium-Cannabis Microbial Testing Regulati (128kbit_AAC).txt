[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'd like to thank the CanMed
advisory panel to give me this opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: to share our study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, I'd like to share what
was the purpose of this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: To understand the status of cannabis
microbial testing regulations in all U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: states and territories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then second, to identify trends in
microbial testing rules since 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to identify a consensus set of
required microbial testing rules to lower
[SPEAKER_01]: public health risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now everyone knows what the federal
perspective of cannabis is, but there are
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals from other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, the use, sale, and possessions is
illegal under federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's considered a schedule one drug under
the federal controlled substance act.
[SPEAKER_01]: And schedule one drugs are considered to
have no accepted medical use, a high
[SPEAKER_01]: potential for abuse, and physical and or
psychological dependence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where is cannabis legal in the United
States?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is as of January 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: So highlighted in gold, 21 states and two
territories have both legal adult use and
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highlighted in green, there are 16 states
that have medical cannabis only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also that would be two additional
territories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the total number of jurisdictions in
the United States is 42.
[SPEAKER_01]: This slide shows the methods of our study.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we reviewed all the current
cannabis testing rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we updated our microbial testing
regulations for each jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the two full size we had was required
microbial test for each jurisdiction and
[SPEAKER_01]: the corresponding action level for each
test, for each product type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's four product types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flour, concentrates, edibles, and
nonedibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the web link where you can find all
this information, updated to the present,
[SPEAKER_01]: is shown in the slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from this data set, we determined for
each test, the number of jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_01]: requiring each test, the number of each
action level for each test, and the number
[SPEAKER_01]: of unique microbial test combinations for
flour and edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this afternoon, I'll only be showing
you the data for the flour testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we performed two sets of comparative
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, within the 2023 data sets for
testing flour and edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, a comparative analysis between a
2019 database and our present 2023
[SPEAKER_01]: database to see the direction of where
microbial testing is occurring in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are some general observations
concerning the required microbial testing
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom line is it's a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 22 different microbial tests that
are required by at least one jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they fall into three categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first category is total count tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's six of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have four examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total aerobic bacteria, total yeast and
molds, total coliforms, and total
[SPEAKER_01]: biotolerant gram-negative bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are four tests where it's
specific genuses, any species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these first two types of tests,
I'm not a proponent of requiring this
[SPEAKER_01]: testing because an enumeration of these
two kinds of tests provides me with no
[SPEAKER_01]: information whether there's any pathogenic
microorganisms in my sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might get a fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might get a failure in my sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the last type are these, there's 12
specific genus species tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the literature, in the clinical
literature, I have five examples here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the four pathogenic aspergillus
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's aspergillus flavus, fumigatus,
niger, and terrius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sugar toxin producing E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of six pathotypes where this one is
the most pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now interestingly, of all the
jurisdictions, the number of microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: tests required was a wide range.
[SPEAKER_01]: One jurisdiction has just one test
required.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few states, as many as 10 tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an example of the sole state in the
United States that only requires one state
[SPEAKER_01]: is total, I mean it's Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the absence of total coliforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyone can Google this and not all
coliforms are pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might get a fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But are there any pathogenic coliforms in
the sample?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Connecticut is over the top where
they have the six specific pathogens that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've described, including also salmonella
species, but also four total count tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the action, there's no consensus even
in the action thresholds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the widest range for the total count
test is the total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the low end is, it's three orders of
magnitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the low end is 1,000 colony forming
units per gram of sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the high end is 10 to the fifth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for all the genus and the genus
species test, it's always non-detect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this slide describes the status of the
microbial testing rules for flowers in the
[SPEAKER_01]: start of this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you focus on the second row,
I've already mentioned the 42
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions have legal programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But three of the jurisdictions,
being three of the territories,
[SPEAKER_01]: have no testing rules to date.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's actually 41 sets of microbial
testing rules because two states,
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona and New York, have separate
testing rules for adult and medical use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have is 13 of these states
share three common testing rule sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have what's commonly known as the
California model, which are the six
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's salmonella species, chigotoxin
producing E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, and the four pathogenic aspergillus
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three states have tacked on total yeast
and mold, and then six states still
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize the archaic American herbal
pharmacopeia model that came out in 2014,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are four total count tests,
total aerobic, total yeast and mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: total coliforms, biotolerant,
gram-negative bacteria, and one
[SPEAKER_01]: nonsensical rule, pathogenic E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please correct me if I'm wrong,
but I have not ever found a single test
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing any technology that can detect
all six pathotypes of E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've asked lab directors,
what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we test for chigotoxin producing E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have, the bottom line is shown
in the lower right, is that there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: chaos here still.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 29 unique test combinations in the
United States, and so there's still quite
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit of chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what we have is I'd like to share with
you the trends over the last three years
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the total count tests and the
specific human pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this slide is the total count test,
and the bottom line is that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: trend towards decrease in the fraction of
the jurisdictions asking for this test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the top line is the total aerobic
bacteria and total microbial count,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereby over the three-year period,
the fraction of jurisdictions has
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased from 67% to 44%, and that being
a change of 23%.
[SPEAKER_01]: The total yeast and mold, they're hanging
on for dear life, whereby it's decreased
[SPEAKER_01]: from 74% to 63%, a decrease in 11%,
and then the third line, total coliforms,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're hanging on to that one too,
but it's a lower percentage of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction as of 2023, it's 37%,
a decrease in 4%, and the biotolerant
[SPEAKER_01]: gram-negative bacteria have decreased the
most, down to 32% of the jurisdictions,
[SPEAKER_01]: was a decrease of almost 40%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what we have now is the specific
pathogen tests, and this shows a trending,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my mind, the correct direction towards
consensus as a beginning point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a salmonella species,
it was already 85%, but additional states
[SPEAKER_01]: have seen the light, and now all
jurisdictions except two require
[SPEAKER_01]: salmonella testing, and then for the
pathogenic E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, that nonsensical rule has now
decreased to 27% of the jurisdictions,
[SPEAKER_01]: a decrease in 17%, and this is an
indication that regulators are being
[SPEAKER_01]: educated that this is a rule that can't be
met.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so until a method developer develops a
test that can detect all six pathotypes,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that the most pathogenic one should
be tested for, that being sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: toxin-producing E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, and there has been a dramatic
increase to 44% of the jurisdictions,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was an increase in 29%, and sorry
for the typo, the aspergillus pathogens
[SPEAKER_01]: have increased also dramatically to over
half, 56% of the jurisdictions,
[SPEAKER_01]: an increase of 26%, and I have collected
23 clinical case publications of
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals acquiring or becoming sick
with aspergillosis affiliated with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a very short talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where might we go from here?
[SPEAKER_01]: The six specific pathogens that are
required in the California model are not
[SPEAKER_01]: all the human pathogens in cannabis
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be the first to admit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we identify these additional
human pathogens, which would lead to a
[SPEAKER_01]: possible creation of a consensus set of
microbial testing rules to be considered
[SPEAKER_01]: by the federal government?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this research study is a massive
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be a national candidate for
cannabis flower microbiome study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every legal jurisdiction that has legal
cannabis, one would determine a
[SPEAKER_01]: statistically significant number of
cannabis flowers, which is a minimum of
[SPEAKER_01]: 400, then they would be sampled in the
different regions of the jurisdiction,
[SPEAKER_01]: noting what type of cultivation was used,
outdoor, indoor, hydroponic, so forth and
[SPEAKER_01]: so on, and the actual technology has
already been developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one does a direct DNA extraction from
the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second step is the amplification of
that DNA for both the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: the yeast, and the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sequences that you amplify for the
bacteria are the 16S ribosomal genes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and for the yeast and molds, it's called
the ITS sequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one has all this DNA now that you've
amplified, and then you do sequencing of
[SPEAKER_01]: this DNA, and there's now nanopore
technology developed by the Oxford
[SPEAKER_01]: Technology Company, where the sequencer is
a little bit bigger than a flash drive,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the computer is quite little,
and you can buy one and play with it for
[SPEAKER_01]: $6,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to contract or have
in-house a bioinformatics expert,
[SPEAKER_01]: and believe it or not, and we've already
done this at MGC, is that you can identify
[SPEAKER_01]: every genus and species in that cannabis
flower, and also you can determine the
[SPEAKER_01]: relative amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have all this massive
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you do with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have the full answer of the
composition of the stakeholders group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that we need infectious disease
doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we need to have clinical
microbiologists, and also clinical,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, risk assessment experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you have a human pathogen in
cannabis flowers, if it's at a super low
[SPEAKER_01]: amount, does not necessarily mean that you
have to add it to the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you find or identify human
pathogens at high levels in a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers throughout the country,
then you want to keep it in the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then literature search experts are
very, very important, because they can do
[SPEAKER_01]: massive literature searches to see what
are the microbial species that are human
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens, which ones are opportunistic
pathogens, and so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through just dialogue,
they identify, identification of
[SPEAKER_01]: additional subject matter experts that
could be included in this dialogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from all this big data set,
one can then determine a consensus set for
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial testing rules for a state,
for a region of the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the whole country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how this is gonna come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to see, I'm sharing this slide
simply to plant the seed for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: consider from now into the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, this study will be
conducted in a stepwise manner until we
[SPEAKER_01]: cover the entire country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to acknowledge the
individuals who helped me in this massive
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dhanushree Nair, Dhanushree Pawar,
and Sravani Chobhi, who updated the
[SPEAKER_01]: database and created all the data sets and
somehow helped me visualize some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this last slide, I have my email up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to ask me any questions,
email me to continue this dialogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this time, I'd like to entertain
any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept my talk short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Sherman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never dreamed anyone can make a talk
about regulations so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you, I've talked to a
couple of people with history working in
[SPEAKER_00]: the USDA, and they have told me about a
lot of, you know, I guess, institutional
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge about agricultural pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there still information that's kind of
known from other crops that we're missing
[SPEAKER_00]: here that we could use to kind of have a
better guess of what to look for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing is that you mentioned the
USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I worked in public health
and environmental chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in our laboratory in New Jersey,
we had some interaction with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Agriculture and again,
thank you very much for pointing that out
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really have not had the opportunity to
ask them in terms of, I know that they
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on the plant pathogens, but with all
the information and all the experience
[SPEAKER_01]: they've had, I'm sure they've identified
some human pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it would be a good source of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like you should look into like berry
sorters, lungs, and rose growers thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of them that are known,
especially from agricultural occupation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is quite a lot of information
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
