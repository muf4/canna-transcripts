[SPEAKER_00]: The governmental decision was that we
Israel will not export flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the moment we shall have medication,
real medications, with the approval,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, the FDA or others,
with good process, GMP, good manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: process, and good supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: The supervision here is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you see, for example,
they need to grow the plant in closed
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not in an open field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if one bird will go over the world
and drop something on the flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: or using chemicals outside, we give the
stuff to oncology patients, and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we give them to cannabis some chemicals
or some bacteria, we will kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we must be very, very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will ask for a good, I said GMP,
good medical process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also GMP, good laboratory process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we shall start with GAP, good
agricultural process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each step, and then is the good
distribution process, and good security.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good security.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we created instructions to all those
stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the moment, and I believe that will be
next year, the beginning or maybe middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of next year, we will be able to produce
good quality medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we shall speak about export.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that this is a real
opportunity to do a lot of good to
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, to earn good money, and to
promote the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two more subjects connected with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not only medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that one day we can sell a lot
of cannabis food supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another field which we will
promote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more, the cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three fields are really,
really future, a very promising future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when, maybe one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of ignorance about the
cannabis subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient, when we prescribe them or
allow them cannabis, they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, I'm not taking narcotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physicians were afraid to prescribe
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't have enough research,
because they are conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not that, as you say in English,
you don't teach all the new tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to teach physicians
new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, we have very aggressive
media and politicians who see this medical
[SPEAKER_00]: path as point of entry to recreational
usage of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use it like those inhalers for
asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just put two improvements inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the heating device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is the computerized
control of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the physician says you take two
inhalations every six hours, that is what
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the physician then has an exact
report, which time it was taken,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was the, the patient can take,
how it influenced him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one very, very clever device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they are on the way to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The places with a lot of research,
we have it on a clinical level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some groups of physicians that try in many
diseases, fibromyalgia, autistic children,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I mentioned, intractable epilepsy of
children is ongoing, very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second field is clinical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one is the research,
the genetic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw in the States, they are very
advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here there's also a kind of research on
those issues, which is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the main things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They believe there will be a lot of
research, but not only on medical issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned also about food supplements
and cosmetics, all those fields are very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very promising financially and from the
innovation way of thinking.
Thank you very much.
