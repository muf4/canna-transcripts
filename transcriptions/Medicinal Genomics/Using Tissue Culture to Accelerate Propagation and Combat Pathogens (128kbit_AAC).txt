[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, just a few reminders before I
introduce our guest for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, be sure to register for the CanMed
24 Innovation and Investment Summit before
[SPEAKER_00]: the early bird deadline of December 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only one month away if you can
believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just announced last week that Golden
Eagle Partners will be returning in 2024
[SPEAKER_00]: with their capital markets workshop that
will cover topics related to investing in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The session was a big hit last year with
representatives from several top
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great opportunity to connect with
them as well as potential investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn more at CanMedEvents.com and
be sure to register today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also accepting abstract submissions
for oral and poster presentations at
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed24, so if you have new or novel
research related to cannabis science,
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, cultivation, or safety testing,
we want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a link in the show description where
you can learn more about the abstract
[SPEAKER_00]: submission process and you can submit your
abstract there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deadline for that is November 18th,
so get on it and good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Bill Graham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill is the founder of MicroClone Tissue
Culture, a company that provides tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture kits, consulting, and training to
cannabis cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: With hands-on expertise, Bill retailed and
distributed hydroponic supplies,
[SPEAKER_00]: sourced grow lights globally, created
biojuice nutrients, designed fresh filter
[SPEAKER_00]: air quality systems, and simplified
micropropagation cloning, creating
[SPEAKER_00]: MicroClone Tissue Culture kits in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discussed the
basics of tissue culture, tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: as a propagation alternative to cloning,
how mother plants can lead to pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: infections and loss of vigor, combining
tissue culture and qPCR testing to
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate pathogens such as hoplite and
viroid, and much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Bill, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Cambium Analytica.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without any further ado, please enjoy my
conversation with Bill Graham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this is a propagation method
that you've been evangelizing for for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the emergence of hoplite and
viroid and other plant pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like now more than ever,
tissue culture is top of mind for many
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's talk about what tissue culture
is and what advantages that it may have
[SPEAKER_00]: over the cloning that a lot of growers are
doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give us a high level view of what is
the tissue culture process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll take it from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, happy to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ordinarily, tissue culture is going to be
practiced in four stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And incidentally, I might just take this
opportunity to kind of tell everybody what
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture is, especially as it
pertains to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very simply, it is hydroponics with
sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're using the same nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some special amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually there may be hormones to give it
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what makes tissue culture special from
the hydroponics that growers are already
[SPEAKER_02]: doing is going to be adding sugar to give
that energy source directly to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sugar can be directly absorbed by the stem
and surface tissues without roots to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide that energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can make plants from pieces that
would be too small to clone very fast
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, because it's sugar, everything
else wants to grow on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you start seeing the
scalpels and forceps and the HEPA filter
[SPEAKER_02]: and the laminar hoods and the pressure
cookers.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those things are to be able to make
the growing medium, clean the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: handle it, and grow it so that the fungus
and bacteria and those things don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: back onto it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But given that, tissue culture is
fantastic for being able to make lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: brand new clones from a sterile source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the plant's clean and it's growing in
the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the four usual steps of tissue culture
are going to be introduction,
[SPEAKER_02]: multiplication, rooting in culture,
and then rooting back out of culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you probably already know that I've
made a little special version of that to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it easier for growers and to make it
more effective for a lot of our producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a completely high level,
what we're talking about is using small
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces of an established plant to make new
copies of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not too dissimilar from what you would
do with cloning just with much smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, it's funny, I'm actually
calling it tissue cloning because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: using tissue culture to clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of part of the shortcut
that I've made up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is to top veg plants taking a two
or three centimeter cutting off of the top
[SPEAKER_02]: so that the plants will branch,
which is valuable for indoor growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is primarily for our vertical
growers, but works for anybody who is
[SPEAKER_02]: raising plants indoors and vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's putting a tip cutting directly
onto rooting medium, which is sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: shortcut of the usual four stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers, they're topping their
plants, like you said, to kind of widen
[SPEAKER_00]: them and give them more of a bushy look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're actually being able to make use
of that by putting it into a rooting media
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of create copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, would that not be a good material to
use for cloning traditionally?
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually makes a bad clone because
there's so much concentrated branching in
[SPEAKER_02]: that piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to take it as a clone length,
you're usually throwing away, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: four, six, even eight good nodes,
which is all growth that we don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get rid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, when a veg tray, which is about
96 or 100 plants, when it's when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, everybody in there is essentially
a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some are going to be more vigorous
than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the technicians are going to look at
it and say, OK, we have enough lower
[SPEAKER_02]: branching that we are going to remove this
much material off the top of that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and leave you know, is it going to be
four, five, six, sometimes eight lamps,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever their number is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that piece has to go and they're
usually just pinching that trash,
[SPEAKER_02]: pinching it compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we did is I was like,
you know, I'm in the facility already to
[SPEAKER_02]: do collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always sending me to the mom
plants to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I prefer to go to the veg plants
because immediately we can tell which ones
[SPEAKER_02]: are strongest just based on figure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And number two is that it's our already
being done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, this is material I can take
that doesn't interfere with any other
[SPEAKER_02]: cloning or propagation going on in the
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it turns out that we could turn
it into an actual strategy to produce all
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants that the grove needs and in
fact, improve the crop quickly by
[SPEAKER_02]: selecting on vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where things get really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you touched on a good point
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with your system, you could potentially
do away with moms and just do all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation off of your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am mom's mom plants worst enemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I totally get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's really kind of funny is
how we got here, because I, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: ran the retail shops, man made equipment
and I and we used it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to be the grower equipment maker
and really mom plants were a means to an
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got us by, you know, as a grower
myself, I never did my did mom plants
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was a waste of high intensity
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get if I'm producing all the veg
plants I need for my grow, then I really
[SPEAKER_02]: just need like two or three flowering
rooms so that I'm producing veg plants
[SPEAKER_02]: every two or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got all the fresh material I need
to cut from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was a college gardener,
I was using side limbs for that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, that was exactly the same
time I got into tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was going to be 20 something years
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not dating myself that I started
realizing, wait a minute, this material
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're proving off the top actually
makes a great clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're taking it from the very best
veg plants, then that vigor, which was
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed in the veg plant, it was cut
from carries over into the new plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: that culture is going to produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're able to we're able to get all
the plants back over to pruning cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I've got a tray of 100 veg plants,
I need to replace, I can take about 35 of
[SPEAKER_02]: the best tops first, and then seven days
later, go back for another hundred or so,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we can be selective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in eight weeks, those tops going into
culture, we're going to be the plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: are being topped again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're able to short the whole selection
cycle down to eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see none of that involves a
mom plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I quite followed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the different stages and different
multiples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Topping the veg plants to make the new
plants that ultimately go back to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so walk me through the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pulling up slides while we're talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pulling up slides while we're talking
so I can actually throw these up if we
[SPEAKER_02]: need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, yeah, if you want to do that,
I could pull it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it kind of show the different,
you know, yeah, it's got a picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplication steps there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But very simply, it just kind of shows a
veg plant being topped and then that going
[SPEAKER_02]: into a tube on rooting medium,
which will grow about three or four times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Its original mass, because that's what's
happening when this cutting is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we've taken a two or three
centimeter cut and put it onto rooting
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture media, the sugar is
absorbed immediately right through the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface of stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that cambium, that green growth tissue
just underneath the surface, is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be turning that into starch complex
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's turning into stored energy wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns it into wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's turning it fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I took all of my last
clones to Rhode Island with me and didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: bring any back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can run over and grab one from a show
the other day, but it's got a little
[SPEAKER_02]: spoilage on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, the bottom gets fat with all
that stored wood and it gets lumpy because
[SPEAKER_02]: of the influence of rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these shortcut tissue cuttings are
ready to root into plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm using tissue culture as a cloning
tool without my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many different copies can you get from
one plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we were doing the straight micro
propagation where one cutting would go
[SPEAKER_02]: into a jar and it would branch and grow on
a on a multiplication hormone that is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be the class of called
cytokinins, which are the opposite of
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygens, which are rooting those plants
will use usually grow to if we're lucky
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to get them to branch to like six
or seven new one and a half centimeter
[SPEAKER_02]: node cuttings in the period of like five
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would make that many new plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start doing an exponential
multiplication on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to have, you know,
we have thousands in the case of regular
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you for a fact that a couple of
plants can turn into tens of millions,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's what I did with citrosa
geraniums.
[SPEAKER_02]: If any of your watchers have the the
mosquito repelling geraniums in front of
[SPEAKER_02]: their house and everybody recognizes them,
those actually came from these hands in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1992, because that was my project when I
went when I was hired to work at
[SPEAKER_02]: Agrostarts hired from college to return to
college with a special one year project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did start with just a hundred
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the original stock plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the parents of all of the
citrosa plants that anybody has ever grown
[SPEAKER_02]: in North America since 1992, which has to
just be in the tens or even a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: million plants by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are those all propagated through tissue
culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: They are now funny enough, the plants they
sent me were in eight inch pots from
[SPEAKER_02]: Holland, which is really interesting
because this was a plant that was
[SPEAKER_02]: supposedly developed by somatic
hybridization.
[SPEAKER_02]: The process was supposedly to take this
sented geranium and grass of China,
[SPEAKER_02]: strip all the cell walls off, make the
little naked still stick together,
[SPEAKER_02]: regrowth some cell walls and then
encourage those to grow in culture and
[SPEAKER_02]: become a geranium that had this citronella
oil in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, that it would, you know,
very much a tissue culture tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the plants I got were in pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was when I first suspected
that they were not actually from tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second was when I got a mosquito
bite when I was in a greenhouse of like
[SPEAKER_02]: 200,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still encourage them because they're
really pretty and they smell great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still have them all over my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's that is tissue culture as far
as a few plants making many.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we really stand today as
an industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the people who have used your are
using your products, especially the HLVD
[SPEAKER_02]: testing, are testing plants that are going
to be dedicated moms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I totally get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to encourage that to to get away
from moms and to try and do a lot of this
[SPEAKER_02]: work off of veg plants for the reason that
we kind of there's a disease cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: involved with mom plants that is unique to
cannabis, indoor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is that, you know, the plants are
the petri dishes for everything we're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good or bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things are shared in innocuous ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's really hard to move the
plants around and clean the tools every
[SPEAKER_02]: single handling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most grows, you know, are never going
to be that discipline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, even just air exposure in the
same grow facility, everything we're
[SPEAKER_02]: worried about grows on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the oldest plants are going to be the
most exposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as your testing reveals so often is
that plants that show no outs or outward
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms can contain viroids, fusarium,
botrytis, aspergillus, any of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're really worried about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, they are the source of all
the new plants in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I the tissue culture shortcut helps
break that because the plants that will
[SPEAKER_02]: become the new crop will have to grow
inside of a sterile tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: For at least three weeks, in which case,
if there's anything there that doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: belong, we can usually see it by eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, the medicinal
genomics gives us tools for being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: PCR test that and know that the material
in the tube itself is also is sterile,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just in the course of three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's that's a good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can label it as a negative and then
follow it afterwards and test it several
[SPEAKER_02]: more times.
[SPEAKER_02]: If for anybody familiar with SEGRA or any
of the companies doing tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: services to clean plants, they will be
doing the exact same things, propagating
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants and testing over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they they usually look for at
least three negatives from subcultures
[SPEAKER_02]: before they kind of give guaranteed viroid
free back to the customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's what does the customer do?
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow another mom plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started all over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put mom in the same room as all the
other mom plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technicians still have the dirty
tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they're cleaning, there's risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just want to kind of break all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides, if I can turn a mom room into a
flower room, I've just made a grower a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more money, sometimes 20
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if the crop gets better from just
vigor, there's another 20, 30,
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 percent from doing nothing else except
selecting on vigor, which incidentally is
[SPEAKER_02]: why we don't have corn that looks like
this anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone went in and said, hey,
that one that one looks a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where they grew next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make a great point about this,
you know, the moms being a bit of a petri
[SPEAKER_00]: dish or an incubator for all these
different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're older plants and they're
constantly being exposed to the air and
[SPEAKER_00]: the elements because they're continually
having their their limbs lopped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of breaking that cycle seems to
make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I did, I had the
pleasure of seeing you present at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Science Conference just recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that was brought up
during that talk was this idea of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: drift, which also seems to be sort of a
problem that emerges from using mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speak a bit about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is actually one of the things
that got the kits popular the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: is because there are a lot of fantastic
growers and especially legacy growers who
[SPEAKER_02]: have been growing plants for 10,
20 years or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are their trademark strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's going to happen in that much
time, especially if it's recycled indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: growth, is it sometimes happens that the
plants are just not yielding like they
[SPEAKER_02]: used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not behaving like they used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not yielding like they used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know it's the same plant because
you do the DNA testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so, you know, what that comes down
to is epigenetics, which is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the expression of the genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why aren't we seeing them and why aren't
they their very strongest?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's usually a couple of things
they can usually be stress related because
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got a really nice indoor
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light comes on at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperature is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we lived in spas, I don't think would
look quite as fit as if, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were outside taking care of the land
like our ancestors, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Though it'd be worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But genetic drift is going to sort of just
be like the plants sort of drop off of
[SPEAKER_02]: what they used to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue culture is a great little tool for
that because it kind of brings back
[SPEAKER_02]: juvenile growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tends to strip off some of the
methylation that has occurred on that DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: in those nice environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, we try to do a two prong
approach anyway, and that is for any
[SPEAKER_02]: grower that's experienced genetic drift is
to try to raise some of the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetatively outdoors in the summer for,
you know, like six weeks or so for that
[SPEAKER_02]: multi spectrum sunshine, the hot days,
the cold nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can even simulate some pest attack with
Harpin protein and material like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, possible real insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insect attack wind, all those things like
that that are actually stimulation to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had several lectures during Canada
Science about stress and so on like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to put the two together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we are going to take tip
cuttings from those outdoor plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: put them into bleach water, which is sort
of our conduit to getting plants into
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is our quarantine to moving
outdoor material back into the grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant cuttings go into the chlorine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We clean the tools every cut, which is how
we are able to take that small piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue and put it into a solution that's
not only cleaning the surface,
[SPEAKER_02]: but preventing thyroid or any other
pathogens from moving between plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another one of the things we'll catch
up on before we get out of here will sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of be the strategy of taking small pieces
to hopefully eliminate and hopefully take
[SPEAKER_02]: material without phyroids and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, no time like the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we've been using your kits.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where this is where the new PCR
has been.
[SPEAKER_02]: I beg your pardon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was mostly for our chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But using your viroid detecting PCR has
been excellent because we're using such
[SPEAKER_02]: small material and we can get smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, two to four centimeters is a good
working size for new users because the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that begin to root are a good size
to go into a rooting plug and begin
[SPEAKER_02]: creating the new plants quickly,
which is what growers want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, as we teach and like our
master class is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll go down to one centimeter,
half centimeter pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can keep going smaller and smaller
because this is the cool thing is once
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got a simple setup and I don't know
your viewers can see, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's behind me, but I've got a simple
laminar hood, which is not even really
[SPEAKER_02]: necessary and a lighted shelf with a HEPA
filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is my grow chamber.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are able to once we've got tissue
culture media prepared, we can do plants
[SPEAKER_02]: of all sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, the premise I have really just
written into a proposal for research paper
[SPEAKER_02]: is that the material, the tips are always
outgrowing viroids or anything systemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the growth is coming from the very
tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, less than a millimeter of the very
tip is the future growth of that entire
[SPEAKER_02]: limb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even before vascular tissues are
produced, so the viroid and so on will
[SPEAKER_02]: move either in the vascular tissues or in
the intercellular intercellular space
[SPEAKER_02]: between the cell walls and the cells
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some will pass into the cells and some
will be shared with the cells next to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's kind of how how cells
communicate, but not quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all passive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as that tip growth is
vigorous, that passive exchange is not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily fast enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there viroid in the cytoplasm in that
brand new growth?
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some of the work that Samir Poonja,
especially as we saw at Can Med,
[SPEAKER_02]: was showed in his presentation is that
viroids and systemic pathogens are not
[SPEAKER_02]: uniform through the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had that one slide of a plant and he
goes, left side has viroid, the right side
[SPEAKER_02]: does not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all the same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where was I?
[SPEAKER_02]: My hand was sky high back there in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, let's talk about that,
because that happens on individual limbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more the plant grows limbs,
the more likely that's the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially the vigorous one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of one thing sort of led to
another in all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your stuff comes in because we can
take a cutting, a small cutting,
[SPEAKER_02]: and actually save a piece of the bridge
tissue, which would be the stem tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: going into that cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I take a four centimeter cutting,
I can use the bottom centimeter for a
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid test and the upper three
centimeters are being cleaned to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we've got your tools for working on
site at that at that location at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment, we can know before that plant is
even cultured if it was negative or
[SPEAKER_02]: positive on the test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of an interesting one that
I talked to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about it at CanMed and I talked
to Kevin is exploring the use of bridge
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue for PCR testing of viroid,
because we shouldn't need much,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially now that you I saw that you
guys have tests with infinitely small
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts of sample, like we can actually
just stab the actual cutting with the tip
[SPEAKER_02]: of a micro pipette, no cutting,
no cutting needed, no washing needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really looking forward to getting
into that because we can now test the
[SPEAKER_02]: piece that's actually being isolated and
grown to be the next crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Negatives mean a lot more if we know that
it's trapped inside of glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a whole lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the talk about using
tissue culture to sort of create a new
[SPEAKER_00]: copy that's that's free of HLVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had always been about meristem tissue
culture, which I think when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking before is that very top tip,
which you're hoping that the viroid hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: had a chance to get to yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like you were just
describing to take a larger cutting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then test the bottom of it where it
had met the larger plant to see if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: anything there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's clean, you assume that the
rest of the cutting is clean as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is totally assuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not necessarily 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't test every cutting, you know,
because if I need if I need 100 veg plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm doing 135 cuts to get it,
that's a lot of expensive testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why it's called sampling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will do some along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've got we've got a whole
strategy for this that kind of involves,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, weaning the viroid out of the
crop gradually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by gradually, it can be 20 or 30
percent a cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those cycles can be eight,
eight or nine weeks apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys if you want to know a little
more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we've gone on, because I do this for
big growers and I did it for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting enough, by the way,
everything that I came up with that we
[SPEAKER_02]: shared was developed for Fusarium first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you all set your set your first
PCR test around with Kyle way back when we
[SPEAKER_02]: were doing gender testing, but you asked
right away, they were like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's the next test we would need?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said Fusarium, because at that
moment I had a massive Fusarium problem at
[SPEAKER_02]: my place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we did this really to eliminate
Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the premise is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And incidentally, it turns out to be ideal
for viroid as well, because they sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to travel and move the same ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you're 100 percent
trying to eliminate viroid in one shot,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where we would take like those half
millimeter meristems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can take a long time to grow a
new plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I discovered was that on a plant
that we might have that might register
[SPEAKER_02]: positive because it was positive because
of where the tests were taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was taken at leaf wharles, you know,
where everything but the pin eight leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: all come together or down in the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are either vascular interstitial
intersections where traffic seems to slow
[SPEAKER_02]: and so they accumulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, of course, the roots are a sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everything kind of goes down
there and stays put.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a testing company, you want to find the
greatest concentration of viroids so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get the result that, yes,
this plant has viroid in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But funny enough, I go to that exact same
plant and do my stuff off of the tips,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if it's if it's been cloned and
it's on the table and we've got vigorous
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we select on vigor, then and this kind
of goes down, the type of research that
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin's doing is that we might have plants
that are naturally resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have a strain of the viroid that
is particularly weak.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have any number of circumstances
that just kind of mean that viroid is not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily a problem, not only in this
particular crop, but in this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the tissue is vigorous, that's our
sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we kind of assume just making up a
number is if we had a positive plant made
[SPEAKER_02]: into 100 clones, vegetative clones,
and we start selecting on vigor on those
[SPEAKER_02]: that taking tops, we're maybe taking off
20 or 30 percent that are absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid free because the viroids will have
not caught up with that tip growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eight weeks later, those same plants
are now are cloned donors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants from the two test tubes that we
topped are the veg plants being topped
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do the same selection on vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we take off another 20 or 30
percent viroid free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we start at a hypothetical 100
percent, we can go down to 80,
[SPEAKER_02]: 62, keep going like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much at the end of the year,
we're in the low single digits getting
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the thing is most of the
growers who have viroids, as your testing
[SPEAKER_02]: reveals, are living with it anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just try to strategically make that
the very best growth that it can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And besides, selecting on vigor seems to
make the entire crop perform better
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mom plants, as growers are using today,
have been selected on vigor anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was eight months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it at eight weeks, we can do that six
times a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, remember, if you're trying to do
breeding experiments, you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: Arabidopsis for plants and fruit flies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you want insects because we
want those generations, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: flip them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is another culture trick,
by the way, is we started doing we started
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting immature embryos, fertilized
embryos at like two days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we fertilize a bud, then dissect the
flower and pull out the fertilized embryo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can put that on culture as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smaller than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you just put it right on the same
medium, you know, a little less sugar,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little less no hormone and give it time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can make plants from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The value being is by just touching the
tip of a scalpel to that little embryo,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can get our DNA sample for that entire
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we can run it through PCR and be
able to see our is our marker pattern,
[SPEAKER_02]: the desirable cross that we were looking
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's how that goes is you do a
cross and your seeds still go all
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be a good deal of
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can test the seeds for the genetics
and then from culture, turn those into
[SPEAKER_02]: whole plants after that selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this is where we work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't veered off a whole different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do what you're doing,
but I want to I want to keep sharing what
[SPEAKER_02]: we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And walk them right up to the edge and
then you take them from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to go back to sort of this this
process of continuing to propagate,
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of get ahead of hoplite and
thyroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I understand it, so is the idea
being that like like like Zamir had had
[SPEAKER_00]: shown in his in his presentation that the
plant typically gets infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes down to the roots, stays there for
a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it kind of proliferates
throughout the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the idea being that like you're
trying to catch those tips before the
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid has had a chance to get there and
then you're kind of constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually moves down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if it's in those limbs,
some of it moves down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The down tends to go down and stay down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could, of course, carry back up because
the asylum, which will go back up to the
[SPEAKER_02]: limbs, is especially active during it's
active early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: For, you know, water and and nutrient
salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, it's primary care carrier
for those in flowering, especially in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets interesting because we have a new
shunt and that is that stored sugar,
[SPEAKER_02]: the wood and carbohydrates we're talking
about in the roots and stems begins to
[SPEAKER_02]: mobilize it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll take complex carbohydrates and
turn it as a simple sugars again and start
[SPEAKER_02]: sending those up asylum, which is when we
suspect that the viroid is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: carried up as well because sugar is
relatively large organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obviously metabolically driven and we
suspect that viroid is involved somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: in gumming up the metabolic process.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first of all, we're doing it in veg
when those things would not be moving
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two is just that all that growth is
coming from the tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like trying to chase a rocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were in its in its in its burn
stream, you know, it's going to be hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what was what was that very tip
growth yesterday is now centimeters or
[SPEAKER_02]: inches higher tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And considering we're talking about things
that are just shared passively sell to
[SPEAKER_02]: sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you get up into growth that high
and in those brand new vascular tissues is
[SPEAKER_02]: they are often missing missed is how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where the testing comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because, you know, I I've done this
for a while and we were sending in testing
[SPEAKER_02]: from tips and we're getting so much more
negative material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's funny is you guys, as a testing
agency, we're saying, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you you should either mix all of those
samples together or let's go for these
[SPEAKER_02]: other high concentrated tissues,
which is great, again, for identifying the
[SPEAKER_02]: presence of the viroid in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would almost go ahead and say it's
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it wasn't viroid, it's something
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, let's if we start doing it
off of tips, there is the greater
[SPEAKER_02]: likelihood that given the plant,
assuming the plant had viroid in it at
[SPEAKER_02]: all, that we're using material that's so
new and it's grown so vigorously that it
[SPEAKER_02]: is viroid free.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we take a cutting with clean tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the part about this I hadn't
mentioned is that to take that top off
[SPEAKER_02]: your hand has been cleaned in bleach water
and tools clean and bleach water actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have a vinyl apron with bleachy sponges in
it and three sets of tools and gloves so
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, from talking to the mirror,
he said, yes, viroid can live in bleach as
[SPEAKER_02]: well, but not well and not for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we you know, it's the best we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is to use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let's we're not going to ask for
trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do our best to eliminate
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that will be cleaning the plant,
cleaning the tools and then taking another
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can, I want to take my sample for the
test from this piece on its way to
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm hearing you correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm a grower and I have a plant that
tested positive for for hoplite and viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe we're assuming that we were
looking at one of those high concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, maybe like the roots or one of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that there's viroid there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think from what I'm hearing is yes,
before you throw it away, you might want
[SPEAKER_00]: to search for a spot on that plant that
doesn't have the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a cutting from that and then try to
use tissue culture to create a viroid free
[SPEAKER_00]: copy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for sure, I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: And above that would be, you know,
taking like a hundred or something copies
[SPEAKER_02]: and testing as many as as you can afford.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have a representative sampling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, again, growers don't need to
freak out because, you know, viroids and
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are shared by plant juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only the juice to juice that's going
to make problems, which is why we clean
[SPEAKER_02]: tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, think of it like HIV or
hepatitis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can you can touch the plants
with your bare hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can move pots around and stuff in the
room when the leaves rub each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily spreading.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know so much about like the
sucking insects, aphids, spider mites,
[SPEAKER_02]: so on like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those things should all be under
control anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea is that I would take like a
hundred and something cuttings and select
[SPEAKER_02]: off a bigger and do the testing on as many
of those as you can afford.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a representative group.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a 30 test, we get 10 positives or 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we'll keep the good 10 and the
other 100 that we go because you're still
[SPEAKER_02]: in business.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the plants that made you tens of
thousands of dollars just a week ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go ahead and grow them again,
always keeping things clean between
[SPEAKER_02]: handlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, you know, we'll test the next
round to where hopefully we'll see,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 12 or 12 or so positives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next time more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, always a valuable part of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would recommend, you know,
testing at least 20 of every 130 or 40
[SPEAKER_02]: plant batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you have a representative sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a process you've used,
you've used in the past and it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, this is one of the best parts
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's why I call and bug you guys all the
time is coming up and saying, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing this thing different and
strategically working out ways to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that we have a suitable sample,
you know, for for the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we'd love to do an application note or
a case study with some of your success
[SPEAKER_00]: stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be a great thing to
have on our website and share with our
[SPEAKER_00]: potential prospects, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's something that you're interested
in, we could do a nice, nice co-branded
[SPEAKER_00]: document.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'll I'll send it to you as I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put in another 800 words yesterday,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get the research done because this
is still we've seen it on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, science is science.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a method and we're going to do it
properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I do enough of these, I may finally
get that degree that I've been seeking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have had a cannabis degree,
you know, if it existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: One hundred and sixty nine credits
undergraduate University of Florida would
[SPEAKER_02]: not be school.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I was growing so I could pay for
those credits and and they were only
[SPEAKER_02]: ninety nine bucks each.
[SPEAKER_02]: So state schools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, everything, everything was
really kind of cannabis, horticulture,
[SPEAKER_02]: molecular biology related.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just one thing right after
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made me leave and I tried to get a
graduate degree, but no one was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: take me because they didn't know what I
was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it went.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really just couldn't marry peas or
beans or corn or something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to get in on with somebody's
good graces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to the ref about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't get you that degree, but we might
be able to get you up on the can med stage
[SPEAKER_00]: if you if you publish that research or if
you send that research to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a decent consolation prize,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also promised to share a copy with Max
Jones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can wrap that all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's in this game together.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Bill, before I let you go,
I want to give you a chance to share any
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that the listeners or the
watchers might be interested in to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more about your process and some of the
research that you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, plug away with any other
ways that people can get in touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And learn more about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I definitely appreciate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I post the I post all the graphics,
links to the videos at microclone dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the videos on YouTube under
microclone 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram is microclone 100, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter X microclone, Facebook microclone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's microclone everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to post little bits and pieces
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can sort of build the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the website is the the very best
direct resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my email is Bill at microclone dot
com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I'll put up resources such as my
appendix or the the index of the research
[SPEAKER_02]: that we've followed, mostly Zameer Poonja,
some of your early stuff on on viroids and
[SPEAKER_02]: detection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And distribution and anything related to
the to the shortcut propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I before when I was getting ready to
talk with you, I did watch some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: videos of the process and you make it look
very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it as easy as you make it look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think maybe in my mind and maybe
other other people's minds, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: like tissue culture seems like a very kind
of daunting process that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to be super clean and super
precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, you make it look very
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when you if you're going to be
full on professional and you've got,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, one hundred, two hundred
thousand invested in it, we'll put up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the the doors and the pass keys
and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally, the whole idea is to learn,
start successfully, get all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do this in that little lunchbox kit
you've seen me carry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have prepared medium in our starter
process usually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: With like an instant pot or a stovetop
pressure cooker to sterilize media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our transfer area is as simple as a
plastic storage bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we work in a little shallow saucer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are cleaned in chlorine water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our choice chlorine is going to be sodium,
dichloro, cyanurate, pool shock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it's ninety nine percent
dissociative chlorine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's free chlorine and it evaporates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we can work in it without rinsing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can make it stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will clean the plants in this
solution and I'll actually put a puddle of
[SPEAKER_02]: it in the saucer so that we're dissecting
the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing is getting on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that gives us a still air box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lastly, will be some sort of a
clear grow area where we can have lights
[SPEAKER_02]: on a shelf and a HEPA filter running
nearby to keep the air clean over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pressure cooker in the kitchen,
a pH meter and some mixing tools and a
[SPEAKER_02]: real simple transfer area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done this at trade shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do this in hotel rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have generally sterilized media in the
microwave right next to the waffle maker
[SPEAKER_02]: in the morning and put plants in that
medium for the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have a little more incidence of
contamination because it's all brand new.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's usually for learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the crazy part is, is we still will
end up with like 50 percent clean plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that the grower will transplanting into
plugs three weeks later.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole idea is that tissue
culture is a grower's tool they can use in
[SPEAKER_02]: the simplest area and can always expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely scalable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got growers who are up to over a
thousand clones a day who started with the
[SPEAKER_00]: same Instant Pot that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just a way to get their feet
wet and get them comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can scale up from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the intimidation out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a grower's tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers innovate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at what the hell we did when growing
was illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, look at what we made work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grow like you have today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You spoiled youngsters.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have had it back in my day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk to school uphill both ways is that we
made stuff from what we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like street light, warehouse light,
whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took it apart, rebuilt it so that it
became a grower's tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had to make that stuff work because
you were not necessarily going to the
[SPEAKER_02]: store to get the answers you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were working in the middle of the
night so they weren't open anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue culture version of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But go to microclone.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see everything that we use and get
started for less than 300 bucks to get you
[SPEAKER_02]: a whole kit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my commercial people can usually get
started for less than a thousand and train
[SPEAKER_02]: several people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm available for consulting by Zoom
or on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure talking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like there's a lot of opportunities
for us to be working together,
[SPEAKER_00]: so excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to see you down in Marco Island
