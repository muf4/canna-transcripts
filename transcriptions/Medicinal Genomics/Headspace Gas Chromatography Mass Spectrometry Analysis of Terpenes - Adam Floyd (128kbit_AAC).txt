[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name's Adam Floyd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a field application scientist with
Perkin Elmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, I'm going to talk about three
of my favorite subjects, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, gas chromatography, and mass
spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk for about 20 minutes,
25 minutes, and then we'll have some time
[SPEAKER_01]: for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've worked in the cannabis industry
about 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of time doing research on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a personal fascination of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that some of the most
interesting chemistry that takes place in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is with the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to begin with, why do we care about
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is this interesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I always liken the cannabis
experience to drinking wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't go out and buy a 200-dottle
bottle of wine because it has 15% alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the longest time in the beginning
of the industry, it was all about THC
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, THC is not necessarily what causes
all of these sort of residual entourage
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not what makes the user experience
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like you wouldn't judge wine by its
alcohol content, you shouldn't judge your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis flower by its THC concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said this very interesting statement
from SC Labs a while ago, where they had
[SPEAKER_01]: tested all of the different winning
cannabis crop strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the winners sort of unanimously had
very unique and interesting profiles,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I thought was pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did all the testing, and across
the board, the THC concentration was
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the winners really had this very sort
of fascinating terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so in the cannabis flower,
there's, depending on who you talk to,
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere from 140 to 250 different
terpenes that are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that there's really
necessarily a consensus about that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I often say 200, because it's right in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get both sides to agree with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The science of testing for really anything
in cannabis has evolved so much in the
[SPEAKER_01]: last 10 years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to see this evolution, particularly
in terpene analysis, is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to go through some
methodologies now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to talk a little bit
about the chemistry of cannabis and sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of the science of doing this testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, terpenes are secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're produced through the MVA and MEP
pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: This also follows the cannabinoid synthase
in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are built from these five-unit carbon
molecules called isoprene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their designation is a monoterpene,
a diterpene, sequestiterpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all indicated by the number of
five-unit isoprene molecules that make up
[SPEAKER_01]: their structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about this a minute ago a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entourage effect, which is sort of the
secondary body high that you experience
[SPEAKER_01]: while you consume cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So people talk a lot about how certain
strains make them feel sleepy or certain
[SPEAKER_01]: strains make them feel paranoid or bring
euphoria about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though because of this metabolic
production, it's not much of a far leap to
[SPEAKER_01]: assume that there is significant
interaction with the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system and these molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there seems to be a lot of strong
evidence that it goes beyond just sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: a flavor experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people really love like this,
you know, purple Urkel is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me feel this certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then why does this other one make me
feel paranoid and negative?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, you know, there's a lot of
research that's being done to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: quantify these specific physiological
responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the coming years,
you're going to see a lot of that research
[SPEAKER_01]: point back to terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to jump into the analysis
of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, this is done by gas
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also do it using liquid
chromatography, but as it's a volatile
[SPEAKER_01]: compound, gas chromatography is really
more appropriate for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the setup that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get into why I love headspace so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for those of you don't know,
this is a headspace sampling system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Middle instruments, a gas chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we use mass spectrometry for
detection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we do any detection,
we got to get our samples ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now those of you who have testing labs in
California and understand the very
[SPEAKER_01]: convoluted ECC regulations, they state
that we have to use 500 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the benefits of headspace is
that you can actually analyze your sample
[SPEAKER_01]: directin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if I take 500 milligrams, of cannabis,
and I put it in a headspace file,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of my peaks are going to be saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to do a dilution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's purely regulated by the state
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the downsides of doing this,
too, is as you well know, every form,
[SPEAKER_01]: every matrix of cannabis that you can
think of exists in some form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because you have a method that
works strictly for flour, like I can take
[SPEAKER_01]: my flour and put it in there, and there's
not a tremendous amount of matrix effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I take oil and put that in a headspace
file and analyze it, there may be
[SPEAKER_01]: significant matrix effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So doing an extraction is beneficial for
all the different types of matrices that
[SPEAKER_01]: you see out in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take these 500 milligrams,
we put it into a sample vial, we shake it
[SPEAKER_01]: up, we crush it into powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use milled beads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or agitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once it's ground sufficiently,
sometimes people will use cryomils,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they'll just shake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we use IPA or methanol, depending on
which solvent you prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we fill the volume to 10 mils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we take a 20 microliter
extraction from that, put it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: headspace file, and we do what's called
total evaporative analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything in that headspace file is in
the gas phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, here's a small example of the
number of matrices that you see out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Butane extract, which people always ask
me, they go, do you have an SOP for
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a look at butter, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's structurally and chemically much
different than a butane extract versus a
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I don't have 800 different SOPs for
sample extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have some general ones that work
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've seen dog treats,
and lotions, and toothpicks, and every
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of cannabis product that you can
imagine has come through our labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditionally, and I did this for 10 years
before I started working heavily with
[SPEAKER_01]: headspace, we would do liquid injection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to do an extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pull out one microliter, whatever your
sample volume is, and you drive it
[SPEAKER_01]: directly into the injection port.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that cannabis is incredibly
dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's over 1,000 compounds found in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have waxes and lipids, THC,
20 plus percent THC, 80, 90 percent THC in
[SPEAKER_01]: certain extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this huge concentration of
other analytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the advantage of using headspace is
that we largely leave most of that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: in the vial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can dictate a specific temperature
at which we're bringing this vial up and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing our injection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything with a boiling point below
that stays in our vial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything with a boiling point that we
want to look at is in the gas phase,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can do an injection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see here, this is
contamination, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually don't even use a glass wool
liner in our injection port.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do liquid injection,
you have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an example of your liner after
seven injections.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're changing those liners a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the maintenance that goes along with
liquid injection can be very problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is certain advantages to it,
but headspace really is hugely
[SPEAKER_01]: advantageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I'm not going to discuss it in
this presentation, you also can do this
[SPEAKER_01]: for residual solvent analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you can run residual solvent
analysis simultaneously with terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which wouldn't necessarily be possible or
practical with liquid injection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an example, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of flower research is done with
direct analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can take a sample, I can put it in
headspace file, bring it up into the oven,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I get all of those volatile compounds
to come off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this technology is used a lot in
environmental analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they look at VOCs in water or
soil, they're able to analyze those
[SPEAKER_01]: samples directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is fantastic, except there's so much
analyte that we want to look at in our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis sample, it makes it very
problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So terpenes, depending on the strain,
you're looking at three to five,
[SPEAKER_01]: six percent by weight of our target
analyte, which is significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to shoot that onto your
column.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to totally overload your mass
spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it is very advantageous for
things like gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or lotion, which are hard to extract,
and that matrix does work well in
[SPEAKER_01]: headspace analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like oils, you can tend to get very
poor recoveries, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: analytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heavy boilers like alpha-bisibolo tends
to not want to come out of these viscous
[SPEAKER_01]: oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did this very cool research project
where we got certified reference material
[SPEAKER_01]: from Emerald Scientific and ran all sorts
of different tests, all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts, to sort of look at the
extraction efficiencies of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: analytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these heavy boilers, we were getting
about 10% recovery from a direct analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did a DMA methanol extraction,
and we were up to 90% recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a slide showing sort of the
theory of headspace analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if we're looking at
terpenes, you can run your headspace at
[SPEAKER_01]: 130, 140 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that has a boiling point above
that is going to stay in your vial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we do our injection from the
headspace of the vial, all that stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: left behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ultimately a much cleaner analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in California, we do this total
evaluation evaporative analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also called total evaporative
technique, where we are doing an
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction and we spike either 10,
20, 40 microliters of analyte into our
[SPEAKER_01]: vial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very useful technique,
particularly because in your headspace
[SPEAKER_01]: unit, you can dictate how long you're
making your injection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can adjust your sample volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I want to inject more sample onto
the column, increase my detection limits,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other problems that come with
that, but it is a flexible methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for a long time, terpenes were
traditionally analyzed using GCFID,
[SPEAKER_01]: so flame ionization detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as sort of the science of cannabis and
terpene analysis has evolved, it sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: creates this ambiguous analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're trying to analyze 140
different types of analytes, using an FID
[SPEAKER_01]: is not necessarily practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people that I know that run it,
their runtime is 60, 70 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our runtime for our 21 terpene method
is nine minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're more than six times more
efficient using a mass spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you're able to get spectral data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is very useful in determining what
terpenes I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I want to look at unusual terpenes,
you've got to have a mass spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, for production style labs,
we do either 21 or 42 of the most common
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because generally there's about 17 that
people really tend to care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in more research settings,
we can add a ton more I know of an
[SPEAKER_01]: individual that runs a 70 minute method to
test for 140 terpenes, which is not always
[SPEAKER_01]: practical, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a production style
environment, you're not going to run 18
[SPEAKER_01]: samples a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tend to step back and focus on these
particular terpenes that people sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see them a lot in labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's a chromatogram from our 42
terpene analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been right around 200 terpenes
identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of sort of cool and unusual ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of time doing research on
terpenes before I started doing this job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were looking at manipulation of
terpenoid production in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is if I could always create
sort of these amazing strains of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be, I mean, that product would
fly off the shelves, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if I could turn $2 bottle of
wine into $100 bottle of wine relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: easily, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could always create these fascinating
and amazing terpene profiles from my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in a consistent way, I would be
hugely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes are very easy to calibrate
and very difficult to truly measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is that they share masses,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're structurally very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all built out of these five carbon
isoprene units.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see very similar masses.
[SPEAKER_01]: 121, 136, 93, 69 is present in most of
these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have coeluting peaks in FID,
you're just going to see a single peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not able to isolate those by mass
and mass ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually do a calibration from about 2
ppm all the way up to anywhere from 500,
[SPEAKER_01]: 1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to be pretty linear across this
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking at rare unusual
terpenes, you can go lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to make just beautiful looking
calibration curves, which is really pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you have to sort of sort through
this massive amount of data that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really a catch-all method
that's easy to analyze for potentially 200
[SPEAKER_01]: analytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the problems, too, with running
these kind of analysis is that you get all
[SPEAKER_01]: these matrix effects like we talked about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talked a little bit about a research
project that I did looking at these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the oil seemed to be particularly
problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some chemistry in which they love
to bind to these heavily boilers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get beautiful recoveries from the
first part of your run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end, they just drop down
to nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've run through those of you in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anybody's going through
validation right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is not a particularly fun
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone through validation a couple
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple times with different labs and
doing with terpenes and residual solvents,
[SPEAKER_01]: but focused now on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they typically include running
precision accuracy, matrix spike recovery,
[SPEAKER_01]: LOD, LOQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this stuff is, terpenes tend to recover
pretty well, particularly with flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, a little more problematic with
running oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have ways around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, here's some data that we ran for
precision and linearity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we run these two different writers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we run a spec standard, 42 terpenes,
and a ResTech standard, which is 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then depending on the lab and their
needs, sometimes they will add in
[SPEAKER_01]: individual terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get this question all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how many terpenes can you analyze
for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how many terpenes do you want to
analyze for?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many calibration curves do you want to
analyze for?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many calibrations do you want to have?
[SPEAKER_01]: That number goes on as long as you want it
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in closing, headspace, gas
chromatography, mass spectrometry really
[SPEAKER_01]: is the cleanest, most effective technique
to analyze cannabis products for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had customers run for multiple years
without cleaning or changing their
[SPEAKER_01]: columns, which I suggest that you don't
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it certainly can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of a testament to how clean this
process can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some digital copies of application
notes relating to this that are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after the presentation, if you want me
to send you one, I can give you my card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any questions or comments
after this, if you don't catch me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can contact me at adam.floyd at
prickenelmer.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a special thanks to the Prickenelmer
cannabis team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Lee and Tom for helping me with all of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I talked a little too fast and
flew through my presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got time for some questions if
anybody has any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you are.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you indicated that in the plant,
you see about 1% total terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're working with commercial vape
oils, what's the range of percentages you
[SPEAKER_06]: routinely see?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in flour, we typically see between one
and five, depending on the spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in commercial vape oil, you see
between 0% and 60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the range is significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at food, so if they
prepare CO2 oil, when you are formulating
[SPEAKER_01]: oils into cannabis products like brownies,
you don't want it to taste like a bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they tend to remove all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just pure isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see in certain extracts,
20 plus percent is not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just one follow-up question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see a difference in the terpene
profile if you extract it by butane versus
[SPEAKER_06]: CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all three of those have different
capacities to solvate terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think is the best way to
protect the terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: So butane extracts tend to be the highest
concentrations from my experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So ethanol is problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pull chlorophyll and a lot of
other things out with ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But due to the hydrocarbon nature of
butane, I think that it preserves what
[SPEAKER_01]: they call sort of the chemivar or the
chemical fingerprint of the plant the
[SPEAKER_01]: best.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wes Burke here from Emerald Scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last round, the spring round of the
proficiency test, the inner laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison component showed quite a bit
more deviation and quantification of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes than we'd like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're especially acknowledging the
importance of these compounds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some conversation and
speculation about what the industry can do
[SPEAKER_00]: to improve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, I think these kinds of
conversations go a long way towards that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious if you think that simple
runtimes versus a lab's profitability come
[SPEAKER_00]: into play in an equation like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this difficult contrast between
doing really, really good science and
[SPEAKER_01]: making money, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So production labs, they have a big
overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the luxury to run a
70-minute method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think that that is partially
problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from my experience with the Emerald PT
tests, they come in an oil-based matrix,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very difficult to efficiently
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that I've done a lot of
research with different combinations of
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there is one that is
generally the most efficient at pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of these compounds out of
this oil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do a strict methanol extraction
in oil, you'll see about a 10% to 15%
[SPEAKER_01]: recovery for the heavier boilers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add a little DNA in there,
it suddenly jumps to 80% and 90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think it's an instrumentation
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has to do with sample prep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell people this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: 95 plus percent of your problems happen
before you put that vial into your auto
[SPEAKER_01]: sampler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: You did 42 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many do you think is possible that you
could do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen 140 that have been run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the problem comes from A, finding
commercial standards, and B, making a
[SPEAKER_01]: calibration curve with 140 calibration
curves, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, as many as you want to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a lot of the commercial guys,
they don't really care about most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about the 17 big terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that people want on
their labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to answer your question, as many as you
want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question is twofold.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, what percentage of the products
you're testing are actually requesting the
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene test?
[SPEAKER_05]: And because the BCC back down on the
industry's pushback from cost perspective,
[SPEAKER_05]: what's being done to bring the cost down
so that terpene profiling can be
[SPEAKER_05]: affordable and we can see that in the
dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_01]: So interestingly enough, I think I feel
like the terpene requests have dropped
[SPEAKER_01]: down significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the feedback, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not a required test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're paying to put something on your
label which can potentially put you in
[SPEAKER_01]: jeopardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to your point, I think that it's very
valuable information.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our focuses is a very quick
runtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another alternative is combining the two
methods, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're always testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For terpenes and residual solids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that really an easier
regulation and faster runtimes can help
[SPEAKER_01]: drive that cost down and promote people
wanting to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to ask about another added level
of complexity in the terpene world is the
[SPEAKER_02]: isomer differences that I'm not sure the
field is really embraced yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know in certain cases, Lanalaol,
I think, has different bioactivities
[SPEAKER_02]: depending upon what the isomer is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beta-karyophylline, we were just talking
at break, has different bioactivities
[SPEAKER_02]: depending upon what the isomer is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think the field should do
to embrace inserting isomer standards into
[SPEAKER_02]: this technology?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do see separation of isomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think education is the key there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people don't know what they want,
they're not going to ask for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And laboratories are not going to give
people information they don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that education really is the
key there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do see like cis and trans neurolytol.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're educated about those and they
request those tests, but they could care
[SPEAKER_01]: less about beta-karyophylline,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that further education helps
to bring those issues to light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the bioactivity of that
is super fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is about pyrolysis studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you have any recommendations if a
lab was to be interested, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: in studying different degradation and
combustion compounds in a smoke medium
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to a vapor medium?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's your take on GC as an
instrument for parsing out some of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's say, the degradation products and
the product cascades that might come from
[SPEAKER_03]: combustion?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's totally a great idea,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a lot of conversations recently,
especially with sort of the vape scares.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have devices hooked up to a GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an appropriate instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a GC triple quad would really be
ideal for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have devices that simulate
smoking, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they use these for cigarette analysis,
what's showing up in cigarette smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to create a hyphenated
system with this technology, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you basically can measure what a single
lungful of smoke from a joint or smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: from, or vapor from a vape pen contains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you would be able to see
the degradation products, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You measure the raw product and then the
vape from it, and you can compare the two
[SPEAKER_01]: and see how much of it is sort of
retaining its integrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is Perkin-Omer looking for any DEA
licensed labs to do these studies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you don't know you're looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
