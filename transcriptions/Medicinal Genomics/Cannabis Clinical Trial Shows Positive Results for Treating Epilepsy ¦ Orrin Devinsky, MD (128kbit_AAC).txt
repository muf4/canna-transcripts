[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Warren Davinsky, the Director of the
NYU Epilepsy Center, and I'm excited to be
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this year's CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some exciting findings from the
GW Epidiolex studies of cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first three randomized placebo control
trials have all found positive results.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, in the Dravet study, the primary
endpoint was change in the frequency of
[SPEAKER_00]: convulsive seizures, and there was a
statistically significant reduction using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol, and in the two Lennox-Gastaut
studies, both of which had drop seizures
[SPEAKER_00]: as the primary endpoint, again,
both of those studies found statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant results with regards to a
reduction in seizures with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, after thousands of years of humans and
doctors using cannabis-based products to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat epilepsy, we now have firm
scientific evidence that the cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of cannabis can work for some
selected forms of epilepsy, and we're very
[SPEAKER_00]: excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
I'm Warren Davinsky, and I'll see you next
time.
