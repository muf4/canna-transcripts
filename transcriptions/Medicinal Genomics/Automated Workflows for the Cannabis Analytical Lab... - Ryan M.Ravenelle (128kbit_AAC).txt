[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to switch gears a little
bit here and talk about cannabis from an
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm Ryan Ravenel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for Hamilton Company, specifically
for the robotics division.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the title of my talk today is
Automated Workflows for the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Analytical Lab, Increasing Sample
Throughput and Data Reliability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm first going to just kind of
introduce Hamilton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise this isn't a marketing heavy
presentation, just so you know who
[SPEAKER_00]: Hamilton is and what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a global enterprise, a global
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were founded in the 1950s by Clark
Hamilton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our flagship product is our syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever done any kind of
chromatography in your life, you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: know the Hamilton syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of our famous product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since then, Hamilton has really grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provide a variety of analytical
products and systems for the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell into a variety of different
industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have robotics, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Devices, consumables, customized
solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also do OEM agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are original equipment manufacturers
for a variety of companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm really going to talk today
about is our robotics division.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's who I work for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think Hamilton robotics,
what I really want you to think of are
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid handling solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really try to drive this home.
[SPEAKER_00]: The simplest way to explain it is if you
are doing any kind of liquid handling in
[SPEAKER_00]: your assay or your workflow, you can
probably benefit from our automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really talking about taking away
the lab tech who's sitting there pipetting
[SPEAKER_00]: on a bench all day long and really putting
that on a robot and freeing up that tech
[SPEAKER_00]: to do other things in your lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have multiple sizes of instruments,
multiple configurations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very integration friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we integrate external devices,
equipment from third party providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And integrate those into our platforms to
really have an end to end solution for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the things that are done in the
assay lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have on deck tools and devices
that we manufacture in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: integrating with third party components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're kind of known in the industry
for leading in service and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of automation
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a new application and a
new market for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have a lot of automation
experience in other related markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get into the nuts and bolts of my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk about why we test
cannabis and what's tested for in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may seem like a silly question to
some.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think anybody here after all
the talks we've heard this week,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no question why we should test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the concerns with cannabis,
some of the concerns and challenges that
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually facing laboratories right
now, and some of the opportunities that we
[SPEAKER_00]: think Hamilton Automation and automation
in general can be a big help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to briefly go over some
preliminary experimental results that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some data that's related to workflows that
are specific to the cannabis testing
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wrap up with some conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start off my presentation
with some really bad examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product recalls are prevalent in many
different industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like you can't open up the paper,
at least with once a month hearing about a
[SPEAKER_00]: product's recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I highlighted two cases because I
think these are relevant to the medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, this McNeil Consumer Health
Care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't remember this,
in 2010, McNeil had a massive recall of
[SPEAKER_00]: children's over-the-counter medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This affected about 130 million bottles of
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you an idea of what was
wrong with these products, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: read the quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the products included in the
recall may contain a higher concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of active ingredient than specified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others contain inactive ingredients that
may not meet internal testing
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others may contain tiny particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it turns out those tiny particles
were actually metal shards from the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment manufacturing line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big deal, especially when
you're talking about children's medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other case that I wanted to
highlight is just from last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys may have heard about this case in
New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a case that affected the State
Police Department up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lab technician there who
obviously lost his job after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he allegedly faked results in a drug
case and drawn into question 7,800
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal cases on which he worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's essentially accused of making up
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was observed writing test results for
suspected marijuana that was never tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean this slide to really be a
scare tactic and have everybody question
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that's on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's important to highlight
that this does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in heavily regulated industries,
so here we're talking about medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about law enforcement,
it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's important to highlight
that automation and laboratory practice
[SPEAKER_00]: are important tools that we can use to
prevent things like this from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: All marijuana is not created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been kind of beat to death during
this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important to keep in mind,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Meery had a great talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been other great talks here that
really highlight that what's in your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis strain, the active components,
makes a huge difference on the condition
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to treat and the effects that
the individual is going to feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to take a pill,
at least probably most of us here
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't, take a pill which you had no
idea what was in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's important to have quality data
out there that consumers can trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the other flip side of it is it's
important to know what's in your cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also important to know what's not
in your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel bad for this guy right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of synonymous now with
pesticides and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the first picture that comes up when
you Google search cannabis and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I blanked out his face there to give
him a little bit of anonymity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel bad for him because it's not
really his fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: The case of using the wrong pesticides in
cannabis, it's an education issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lack of oversight issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys may have heard in 2005,
Colorado actually withheld up to 60,000
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for pesticide contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pesticide that was implicated
there was called myclobutanil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is this is a pesticide
that's used for normal agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: products, everyday products that we
consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's exposed to heat,
it forms hydrogen cyanide gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's something you don't want to
be smoking, it's hydrogen cyanide gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's kind of a knowledge and an
experience thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a real problem out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why are some of these problems and
what kind of issues does a lab have to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's always a balancing act from the
analytical perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one side, you have producers and
growers who have expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want cheap tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want accurate tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want fast tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want product locked up or being
essentially burned or destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it fails tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want their product sitting
around waiting for results so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, you have consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they care about product safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about quality ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about getting the proper
medicine for the condition that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really how do you as an analytical
laboratory kind of balance these needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that automation in general is
a very good tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we can use to kind of satisfy these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of myth busting is that
nothing that's being done in these labs is
[SPEAKER_00]: new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think since this industry grew literally
out of garages and basements, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been underground for so long, that there's
still kind of a lot of tribal knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in the laboratory setting out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of kind of belief that they're
unique and that the things they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: have never been done before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's absolutely not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the things that are being done in the
analytical lab for cannabis is all stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that has been used for a long time and is
very well established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the application's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the methods are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using liquid and gas
chromatography, mass spectrometry,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial contamination, measurement via
whether it's PCR or plating out and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: colony counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is not new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is good news for the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of technology and a lot of
knowledge out there related to the food,
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, and consumer product safety
testing markets, drug discovery markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the information's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is usually done at a cannabis
facility when they're doing testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on what state you live
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the regulations fluctuate
quite wildly depending on where you are
[SPEAKER_00]: geographically in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's look at some of the common
panels that are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moisture content, potency analysis,
terpene analysis, foreign matter
[SPEAKER_00]: inspections, microbial screening,
mycotoxin screening, which mycotoxin is
[SPEAKER_00]: mold, residual solvent if it happens to be
an extract or a shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to probably be smoking an
extract that has a lot of butane left over
[SPEAKER_00]: in it, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy metal screening is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that heavily relies on the type of
fertilizer and the growing conditions that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are in because they're very
good at soaking up what's in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, as I've already mentioned,
the pesticide residue analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones I have highlighted in green
are really amenable to automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little bit more about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the protocols that are
done in a typical potency analysis or
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the workflows are very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The steps that are used are things that
are used in industries all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be grinding samples,
homogenizing samples, adding extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents, vortexing and mixing your
samples in your extraction protocol,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably doing some kind of separation,
whether it's a filtration or doing a solid
[SPEAKER_00]: phase extraction, extracting your analyte
of interest, and then doing an analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are common things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are things that Hamilton has a
lot of experience automating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk specifically kind of
about separation and cleanup or solid
[SPEAKER_00]: phase extraction that's used in pesticide
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some results here, some quick
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it kind of shows, it gives you guys a
flavor for what we do and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions that we have that are applicable
to this market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in separations, we did a quick study
here comparing three different sample
[SPEAKER_00]: matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's flour, edible, and concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is done with one of our partners
in California, a very reputable lab there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is using a device that we have,
an empty little device called our MPE
[SPEAKER_00]: squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a horrible acronym.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you what it stands
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's basically just a positive
pressure extraction module.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're able to do with this
module, as you can see in the little
[SPEAKER_00]: cartoon there, is input a filter plate,
for example, a 96-well filter plate,
[SPEAKER_00]: pull that into the unit, have a collection
plate underneath it, and apply pressurized
[SPEAKER_00]: gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can basically do a one-shot
filtration of 96 samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've ever done hand filtration in
a lab, like, for example, a syringe
[SPEAKER_00]: filter, you know it's a huge pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've got to put a sample in a
syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually a lure lock filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to push it through manually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have something like this,
you can do a full plate in one shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at a comparison between that
traditional manual filtration with the
[SPEAKER_00]: syringe and syringe filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at some samples that we filtered
on our unit and compared them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a table showing the results
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing to take away is if you compare
the mean values that we measured for the
[SPEAKER_00]: analytes with the manual method compared
to the MPE squared, we typically had
[SPEAKER_00]: higher mean values that we were measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know why this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a trend that we consistently
noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the standard deviation
as a percentage of the mean, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had a better standard deviation,
which, at the end of the day, means your
[SPEAKER_00]: data is more reproducible and more
reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things to highlight from the study
are savings on consumables and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this lab happened to tell us that they
probably saved at least 30 seconds per
[SPEAKER_00]: sample going with the automated method and
40% on consumables going with the plate
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot less waste generation,
for example, and a lot less manual
[SPEAKER_00]: intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another highlight of this unit that we've
used for solid phase extraction or a
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanup step in pesticide analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically when you're doing a pesticide
analysis, you add your sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of internal standard,
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're adding in some kind of extraction
solvent, some salts to promote separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spin it down or do a separation step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take that supernatant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that supernatant has to be cleaned up
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically what happens is that
supernatant goes into a tube manually with
[SPEAKER_00]: some resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shake it, vortex it, mix it,
spin it down again, transfer that into
[SPEAKER_00]: your machine for analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case, we ran that normal
standard method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just took a plate that had the
cleanup resin in it, directly transferred
[SPEAKER_00]: the supernatant sample into there,
pushed it through in our device,
[SPEAKER_00]: and went straight to the analytical
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's, again, a table summarizing
the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to note is the recovery,
the pesticide recovery was significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: lower with the automated method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think there's things that can be
done to increase that, but overall not
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the recovery there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what state you're in,
how they set their limit, how they
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate pesticides, the recovery may not
be a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's things you can do to correct
for that, for example, with internal
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing to highlight about this is
the savings on prep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: About an hour over 96 samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this doesn't sound like much to
people, but we'll talk about how sample
[SPEAKER_00]: throughput is likely going to increase
here very soon for a lot of these labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other options that we have on our
instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are unaware of these,
so I just thought I'd kind of throw them
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's companies, our collaborators
called DPX Technologies, that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: offers pipette tips that have resin
prepacked in the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do extractions in the pipette
tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to use other sources
of lab ware.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically pipette it into the tip,
and you can do some mixing in the tip and
[SPEAKER_00]: do a cleanup, for example, just right
there in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are huge time savers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cost savers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they eliminate a lot of manual
intervention and a lot of these workflows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard some awesome talks here about
really the power of genomics and how
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to increase and how that's
going to actually take to the next level,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, cannabis as a medicinal product
when you can dial in strains that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be exactly what you need to treat
your symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've worked with medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also cortigen, you know, and
automating some of their kits,
[SPEAKER_00]: having their kits available on our
platforms to really just, at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, you load up your samples on the
robot and you click go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do some of these genetic
profiling, microbial contamination tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant sex, strain identification,
really walk away solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to wrap up here by kind of
putting it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point of automation is,
you know, really there's a couple points
[SPEAKER_00]: to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: The speed and accuracy definitely are
things to think about from a laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan for demand growth, because I'll just
give you an example in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's estimated that probably like five to
six percent of the cannabis samples are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually tested in labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in 2018, eight months from now,
that's going to be mandated 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a 20-fold increase in sample
throughput.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be very difficult to
handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is automation has to be in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's very important for labs
to consider it now, where maybe not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily they don't have the sample
throughput, but they're going to be hit
[SPEAKER_00]: with it soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to be familiar with the
automation aspect of it now, before you
[SPEAKER_00]: have 4,000 samples backlogged and you have
people screaming at you from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from every end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, some of the things that I
talked about, you know, the dry labbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, the scandals,
when you have automation, you have data
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking, you have validation,
you have things that protect consumers at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day to prevent things like
that from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can go back and have a data trail,
an audit trail, to show that things were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually tested, I mean, you can't fight,
you know, you can't fake that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reproducibility is key in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see a huge demand,
I think, in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hamilton's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the experience and just wanted to
let you guys know kind of who we are and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just end with a quote that I think
really aligns nicely from Joycelyn Elders,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's former Surgeon General of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evidence is overwhelming that
marijuana can relieve certain types of
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, nausea, vomiting, other symptoms
caused by such illnesses as MS,
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, AIDS, or harsh drugs sometimes
used to treat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same theme in the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's very efficient in treating a
lot of things out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, Hamilton is aligned with
the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were concerned about consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're here to protect consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We push science forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can be a part of this whole
movement, we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
Thank you.
