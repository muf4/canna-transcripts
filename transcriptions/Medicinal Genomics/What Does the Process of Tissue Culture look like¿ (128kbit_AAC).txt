[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could you walk us through the process
of tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give you a very brass tacks,
very basic explanation of the tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I have some images from both our
research and also some cartoony ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are a little bit easier to see if like the
screen small like they're watching on
[SPEAKER_01]: their phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the basic process of tissue culture is
first you do a selection of materials that
[SPEAKER_01]: you select a plant and you select the
tissues in question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you take and.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll pull up this cartoon, so you'll take
a cutting from those tissues and sterilize
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so that you only are dealing with
the plants that you wish to deal with and
[SPEAKER_01]: not of any of the pathogens or any of the
other materials you're specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only selecting for like,
say, for instance, you only want Marisam,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like bud tissue, or you only want
leaf tissue, so you just get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you plate the tissues on a media
that has the cell signaling compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's those compounds that I said
beforehand were like the plants saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, look, this happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it grows into a mass of these
undeclared majors of cells like
[SPEAKER_01]: undifferentiated tissue called callus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take and you start giving it
signals to say like, hey, I want you to
[SPEAKER_01]: make roots or hey, I want you to make this
compound or hey, I want you to make
[SPEAKER_01]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for in this micro propagation slide,
what you're doing, what this is doing is
[SPEAKER_01]: we're taking some of the body tissue,
converting it into callus, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: converting that tissue in the callus.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're making the callus grow over
and over again, we're also telling it to
[SPEAKER_01]: make more plant babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's the cartoon version.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of the research pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not necessarily be as clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an example where that upper
left, the white tissue, that was some
[SPEAKER_01]: cuttings that I took off of a economically
threatened plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grew a whole mass of that tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, that amount of tissue would take
about two or three years to grow because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a perennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was grown in months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we convert those tissues into a
special subtype and start making plant
[SPEAKER_01]: babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from our lab currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with some of our partners
and working doing some work for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took some cuttings off of one of
their mother plants and then did a then
[SPEAKER_01]: selected for tissues, plated very small
tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys, what they start doing on
that little jelly media that they grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they they're in, they grow,
they reproduce, they grow, they reproduce,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get bigger, they reproduce and more
and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as they get to a certain size,
they start throwing shoots off and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: cut the shoots off and propagate,
cut the shoots off, propagate until you
[SPEAKER_01]: get basic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably a little bit more easy
for the audience to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like the basic process of tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for watching.
