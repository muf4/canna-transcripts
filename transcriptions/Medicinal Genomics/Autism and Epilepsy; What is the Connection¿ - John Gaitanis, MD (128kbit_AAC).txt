[SPEAKER_00]: Just to introduce myself and why I wanted
to discuss this autism-epilepsy
[SPEAKER_00]: combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a pediatric neurologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an epileptologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I came into this field of
cannabis, because it's almost inescapable
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a child neurologist,
especially if you really focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Dr. Goldstein mentioned,
we're seeing now this growing interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been growing for some time,
but it's almost like Groundhog Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I experienced going through epilepsy
treatment is now I'm seeing the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: develop in my patients with autism,
meaning that the moms are coming very
[SPEAKER_00]: motivated, very interested in getting off
a lot of the medications that have led to
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme side effects for many of the kids
that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think of the different things
that we're talking about here,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the various conditions, the two big
systems that are being highlighted here
[SPEAKER_00]: are brain and the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are systems that evolve over a life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very complex in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's huge individual variation
within both of those two systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so any neurologist is going to have to
become adept at this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll move through these slides pretty
quickly, because I think this is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: well known by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the latest rates from the CDC are that
autism is something that we've seen about
[SPEAKER_00]: one in 59 children now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the trend, when you go
from the year 2000 to 2014, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: from numbers in one in 150 to one in 59.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a major issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually at the point of crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably beyond the point of crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I see every day are the kids,
when this epidemic really picked up,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of those kids are no longer kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're entering a world where there's
nobody to care for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no internal medicine docs to
care for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have living situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have day programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big issues that we're seeing,
the one at the very bottom is probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important, the aggression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So self-injury or aggression towards
others has been a major, major challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a host of issues that we face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So common issues include things like
anxiety, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pans and pandas world.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things are big issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain is a really under-reported concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the kids I see have chronic
headache, chronic abdominal pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not verbal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard for them to express that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, too, sometimes comes out through
the aggression.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to first start by going back
to, it was around 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a mom who brought this whole
idea to me, even before epilepsy really
[SPEAKER_00]: took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to always credit moms for
coming up with all the really good ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the moms out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dads are kind of like somewhere
between a coin flip and a magic eight
[SPEAKER_00]: ball, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you ask a mom, and they're on the
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know really what the right
direction is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their gut instinct is something you
always have to follow, especially in child
[SPEAKER_00]: neurology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a mom who came to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Marie Lee is an author who came to me
with her son.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's written editorials to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the Washington Post, she wrote a
beautiful four-part series for Slate
[SPEAKER_00]: Magazine, online magazine, regarding her
experience using cannabis in her son.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to highlight is that this
started, I forget the year, the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, it was incredibly brave for
her to bring this forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was real fear that child
protective would be at her door,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking her son away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine how that would play
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thankfully, it didn't go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, what occurred is he went
from a child who was having over 300
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive episodes per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: His teachers were wearing Taekwondo arm
pads just to protect themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: To basically having multiple days,
day after day, with zero aggressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went to a school where they would
actually keep a clicker and count all the
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way she described it two years in
was she stated, and she was very open
[SPEAKER_00]: about the fact that this is not a cure,
but it was a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now her son, the most severe
symptoms were alleviated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both her, her husband, her son,
could finally, as a family, heal together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of living in a house full of
screams and destruction, they could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be people who were happy as a
family unit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affected the whole family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an important thing to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a child who's going through
this, no one in that household is
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's an important issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to just highlight it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Goldstein mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is really an epidemic right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a serious, serious concern to the
families that I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't see them all because of the
number of phone calls that we get and the
[SPEAKER_00]: referrals we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of work to describe the
prevalence of aggression in autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost 70% will have behaved
aggressively towards caregivers,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 50% towards non-caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see it as commonly in kids who
have cognitive impairment from other
[SPEAKER_00]: causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually fairly uncommon in kids with
cognitive impairment from other causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reasons for aggression in autism
are very different than in other kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that it's worth noting,
I mean, there have been many trials to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through standard pharmacotherapy for
autism and aggression, 46
[SPEAKER_00]: placebo-controlled trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those, the only two FDA-approved
products for aggression are both
[SPEAKER_00]: antipsychotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not, you know, I mean,
this is what we have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you kind of play it by the book and
you go and you're a child neurologist and
[SPEAKER_00]: you go based on what we have available,
I could put you on one of two
[SPEAKER_00]: antipsychotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is one is they don't work
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just speaking from my own experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second is that they cause a lot of weight
gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just took a kid, and I've had many
kids like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a kid who weighs 100 pounds or 230
pounds who's aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made him weigh 230 pounds and
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see where that leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a serious issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus you have other things like movement
disorders, sedation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even have some kids, the increased
appetite on antipsychotics can be so
[SPEAKER_00]: severe that sometimes that itself is a
cause of aggression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids are so hungry, chronically,
that the food becomes their trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine, again, the families
are dealing with massive social isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just met up with someone I knew in high
school who's been living with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she hasn't been to a movie in 10
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: She hasn't been out to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get babysitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, it's something you feel
like you're trapped sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one mom mentioned in an article that
she describes an unbearable level of
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaustion and almost feeling like she's
in jail for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, we need to help these
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my own practice, one thing I do note,
this is something that's much more common
[SPEAKER_00]: in boys than girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autism itself is more common in boys than
girls, but the aggression in particular is
[SPEAKER_00]: more common in boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these boys had the history where
they were developing normally up until
[SPEAKER_00]: about 18 months and then suddenly had a
regression of developmental milestones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like regression begets
aggression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kids who, what happens is
almost they go through like a second
[SPEAKER_00]: regression in their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little testosterone around 12
to 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to go through adolescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if testosterone is the
issue here, but we're on UCLA campus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we could probably walk by the
fraternity row here on a Friday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we probably could see the
effect of testosterone on neurotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't think it's good for my kids
who are nonverbal either, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a major factor here because it's always in
adolescence when this develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that's interesting,
and this is where we're gonna go with the
[SPEAKER_00]: autism seizure combination here,
is that in kids who have a history of
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy, sometimes the aggression kind of
precedes it or builds up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of them both as sort of a
hyper-excitable state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their brain is hyper-excitable,
and it builds from aggression into
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these kids didn't have epilepsy
when they were younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They developed epilepsy sometimes as
teenagers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the causes, like in all things,
are multifactorial here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a combination of anxiety,
OCD, pain syndromes, sensor integration,
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: List goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for each kid, we have to find out what
their individual triggers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I want to kind of bring up
this epilepsy-autism connection is we
[SPEAKER_00]: might, in the end, be treating the same
thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that cannabidiol works very
well for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're looking at in autism
may really be dealing with many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rates of epilepsy in kids with autism
are very high, and the rates of autism in
[SPEAKER_00]: kids with epilepsy are very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two things go together,
and don't think of them as comorbid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it more like when you have a
cold, you have sniffles, cough,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a fever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't comorbid conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all caused by the same cold,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just different symptoms of the
same thing, and that's more the way I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to view this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you think of the root causes,
and there are many, some disorders might
[SPEAKER_00]: relate to neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example would be Fragile X,
which involves a metabotropic glutamate
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor, M-gluorophive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some issues might relate to growth
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example there would be the mTOR
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: mTOR is a growth regulation pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important for certain types of
tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would include things like
tuberous sclerosis or neuroparamitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these conditions I'm mentioning can
cause both autism and epilepsy together
[SPEAKER_00]: from the same underlying cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have channelopathies, dravasis,
syndrome being a very common one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a sodium channel defect that
causes seizures at a very young age,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also causes very high rates of autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have immunologic factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example there, an extreme one,
would be the NMDA receptor antibodies,
[SPEAKER_00]: where antibodies are binding to these
excitatory neurotransmitter receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that in turn can cause a whole host of
different issues, but in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making a little more complicated,
spike waves, on EG might actually play a
[SPEAKER_00]: direct role in terms of language
regression or autism features in kids with
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an important role here for EG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm an EG-er by trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: EG doesn't really do a lot, but this is
one area where it actually helps,
[SPEAKER_00]: because for most of us it squiggles on a
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at what we have available
now in terms of data for autism,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an area that is going to require a
lot of growth, and it will take off the
[SPEAKER_00]: way epilepsy did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can look at various preclinical
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Fragile X, it's actually a little bit
mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see improvements with either
blockade or enhancement of endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are in rat models, so it's hard to
know if this translates to humans and
[SPEAKER_00]: which one would translate better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's interesting that oxytocin,
which has been long touted as potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: essential treatment for improving
aggression in patients with autism,
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole mechanism probably works
through the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in mouse models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxytocin itself will reinforce social
bonding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think of this as the hormone that gets
released when people breastfeed or when
[SPEAKER_00]: you see a cute little puppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling,
and it drives anandamine mobilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nucleus accumbens as part of the brain
that's important for motivated behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like addiction are actually related
to that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may be some link in oxytocin.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Dravet syndrome, what's really
interesting is in mouse models for Dravet,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you improve the seizures, you actually
improve the autistic-like behaviors,
[SPEAKER_00]: as autistic as a mouse can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mice do show there are ways to grade
social interaction of mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: With improvement of seizures comes
improvement in development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be huge if you could actually
improve the seizures and improve the core
[SPEAKER_00]: features of autism, because many of the
seizure treatments we have may sedate you,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may drug you, but they're not going
to fundamentally improve your social
[SPEAKER_00]: development or your language development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have that would be a game-changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really limited on clinical studies,
but this is where we give a shout-out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Nation of Israel for stepping up in
this area, because we haven't been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do these in the U.S., so I have to
acknowledge that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a few case reports,
but more recently, coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerusalem, there is an ongoing prospective
study, but this was very exciting when
[SPEAKER_00]: this got published, that looking at a
total of 60 patients with autism,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them were low-functioning,
not very verbal, mostly boys, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were treated with, it was a 20 to 1 ratio
that they were using, so something similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to what we would do for epilepsy,
and the dose went pretty high,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it went up to 10 mgs per kick per day,
and I don't go that high in my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my patients don't, I don't think
to go that high, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often they don't tolerate it at lower
doses, but the behavioral, what they saw
[SPEAKER_00]: is those behavioral outbreaks of
aggression had improved in 61% of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like anxiety and communication
problems also improved in a good
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage, and you can look at the
frequency of the actual disrupted
[SPEAKER_00]: behaviors, so these patients, it's not
like the disrupted behaviors fully ended,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in the patients who were having them,
the frequency per day had dropped,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one thing that was noted is that this
is something that was a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: evident in boys, and a little more evident
in kids who didn't fit a specific genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome, so for most kids with autism,
most kids still don't have a known gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: despite the fact that we have very
advanced genetic testing these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: our hit rate is only about 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most kids don't have a known gene or known
syndrome, and those were the kids that
[SPEAKER_00]: seemed to respond well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was noted that there were some sleep
disturbances, irritability, loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: appetite, but based on this, the same
center is gonna launch a prospective
[SPEAKER_00]: double-blind placebo-controlled trial with
120 patients, so that's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the direction we need to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my own observation, I have much smaller
numbers, admittedly, but what I could say
[SPEAKER_00]: from what I've seen, I have about 200
patients with autism and aggression that I
[SPEAKER_00]: follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm an epileptologist, so most of
my practice is epilepsy, but only about a
[SPEAKER_00]: tenth of my patients have moved towards
cannabis-based therapy, but of those 24,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have a little bit of a higher
percentage of girls who've gone towards
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-based therapy, but what we've
seen is the epilepsy in those who've had
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy, I've seen a very high rate of
improvement, which is great, so of those
[SPEAKER_00]: 24, 17 had epilepsy, 14 of which saw
improvement there, and we saw similar
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements in those patients,
so the 24 who had aggression as the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary symptom, so keep in mind,
aggression's not the only symptom that
[SPEAKER_00]: patients are treating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're treating inflammation,
they could be treating abdominal pain or
[SPEAKER_00]: GI symptoms, so there are other reasons
they might pursue this, but of those who
[SPEAKER_00]: had aggression was the primary thing for
those individuals, particularly the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-syndromic boys, about 10 out of 13
from my own practice saw improvement,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of those kids who had a regression,
I'm seeing improvement in about 11 out of
[SPEAKER_00]: 13, so it seems to me if you had to pick
the patients that you wanna consider this
[SPEAKER_00]: in, the typical patient that I think was
gonna respond well, those who have
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy, but the story would kind of
follow like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a child who was developing well up
until about 18 months, had a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: regression, and then now sometime between
about 12 to 14 years of age is suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: having an increase in aggressive
behaviors, and then somewhere around that
[SPEAKER_00]: same time, they're developing epilepsy,
and that's a pretty good patient to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider this as a therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing to counsel patients on,
though, this is not a cure, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna continue to have aggressive
episodes, but this will be just one extra
[SPEAKER_00]: tool in your toolbox to help things,
and the other thing to note, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that what was done in Jerusalem is
different from what I'm using or what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing because their dosing was higher,
but the ratio is also different.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I generally find is that patients
need ratios, when you look at CBD to THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're doing better when you're
getting into a five to one or three to one
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of ratio than that 20 to one ratio,
but no two kids are the same, so I really
[SPEAKER_00]: can't make any broad assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little more, I think Dr.
Goldstein emphasized this well,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of art in this, and you have
to really listen to the feedback that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting, and if we look at setting
up future studies, we have to acknowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a lot of heterogeneity within
our patients, so we have to look at a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of various factors to decide what's the
right therapy, and we have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, think of what are the specific
indications that these patients need help
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing is our kids need
help, and the parents are super motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get their kids better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could set up trials, you'll recruit
like nobody's business, and this is my
[SPEAKER_00]: group at the floating hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Dr.
