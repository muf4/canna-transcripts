[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_03]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we are back to our normal podcast
format this episode, but I hope you
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoyed the conversations we recorded
live.
[SPEAKER_03]: at CanMed 2022 in the CanMed Coffee Talk
Lounge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great to have some face-to-face
interactions with folks, and I look
[SPEAKER_03]: forward to doing it again real soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of doing it again, we are working
hard behind the scenes to get all of our
[SPEAKER_03]: ducks in a row so that we can announce
details around CanMed 23.
[SPEAKER_03]: While I'm not allowed to give too much
away, I will say that next year's event is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be unlike any other event we have
done so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: You aren't going to want to miss it,
and I can't wait to share the details.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you can tune into the podcast
for updates, but you can also sign up for
[SPEAKER_03]: email alerts at CanMedEvents.com and
follow us on social media to make sure you
[SPEAKER_03]: are among the first to receive the
announcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode features a conversation with
TJ Martin, who is the VP of R&D at
[SPEAKER_03]: Abstrax, a company that specializes in
research, development, and production of
[SPEAKER_03]: botanically-derived and cannabis-inspired
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: TJ and his team recently published a paper
that identified a new class of aromatic
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis compounds called volatile sulfur
compounds, or VSCs, which are responsible
[SPEAKER_03]: for that signature skunky, gassy smell
that is so prominent in certain cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a major breakthrough for their
team because, as TJ mentions in the
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation, a common criticism of
botanical terpenes is that they can't
[SPEAKER_03]: recreate the signature gas smell of an OG
or a gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a critique that inspired TJ and his
team to investigate what they were
[SPEAKER_03]: missing, and lo and behold, they found
VSCs.
[SPEAKER_03]: During our conversation, we discuss
Abstrax's process for recreating flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: profiles for classic cannabis strains,
how TJ and the team used multi-dimensional
[SPEAKER_03]: gas chromatography to separate compounds
by molecular size and polarity,
[SPEAKER_03]: revealing additional compounds,
how even though VSC concentrations are
[SPEAKER_03]: orders of magnitude lower than terpenes,
their effect on our taste and smell is
[SPEAKER_03]: much higher, the similarities in structure
between cannabis VSCs and VSCs found in
[SPEAKER_03]: garlic, and what medicinal implications
that discovery may have, and finally,
[SPEAKER_03]: although VSCs are needed to create that
skunky, gassy aroma, it is actually a
[SPEAKER_03]: combination of VSCs and other terpenes
that makes that signature smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to my conversation with TJ,
I want to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_03]: Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Founded in 1999, Advanced Nutrients was
the first to develop a complete nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: system that unlocks the true genetic
potential of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since its inception, the brand has
introduced more than 50 innovations to the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation community and continues to
revolutionize the space through
[SPEAKER_03]: proprietary scientific discoveries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn more at advancednutrients.com All
right, and without any further ado,
[SPEAKER_03]: please enjoy my conversation with TJ
Martin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon, TJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really stoked to be part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too, because today we're talking
all about that stinky, skunky smell that's
[SPEAKER_03]: so potent in certain strains of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a long time, that skunk smell or that
gas was one of the few things cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: users could use to judge the quality of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, today we know that good
cannabis can smell like just about
[SPEAKER_03]: anything from fruit to herbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: TJ, I was hoping you could start and tell
us a bit about what interested you about
[SPEAKER_03]: researching the causes of that skunk smell
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what really interested us over here
at Abstracts, I mean, we're a company here
[SPEAKER_00]: who not only are we, so we're a company
that focuses on cannabis flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas, not only just botanically derived,
but also cannabis derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have one business that's Abstracts
Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do all of our non-cannabis infused
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are directly replicating the
exact flavor and aroma of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but without using any actual cannabis in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a brand who wants to be like
Coca-Cola and have your product in every
[SPEAKER_00]: single state and country in the world,
but have it taste exactly the same like
[SPEAKER_00]: you want, so you own Jack Herr or Gelato
or Runtz or Cushments, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to taste exactly the exact
same in every state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can extract it and ship it to
every state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be illegal, but we can create it in
a botanical format using our research to
[SPEAKER_00]: directly replicate that exact smell and
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now, since it has no cannabis in
it, we can ship it to every state and
[SPEAKER_00]: country in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a brand, now you can start building
that brand recognition and that flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: profile that people know and love in every
single state without any concerns of
[SPEAKER_00]: variability or legality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have our cannabis touching
business which are licensed extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and research facility in Long
Beach where we research and understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what makes each cannabis strain different
and unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does Jack Herr have its own unique
scent that's wildly different from Gelato,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also wildly different from like
OG Cush?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, some of these two of those
have really heavy, gassy, skunky scents to
[SPEAKER_00]: them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But Gelato and OG Cush are wildly
different, not only from when you smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: them and consume them, but also to just
how they taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelato is known to have a really complex
layered flavor profile, and it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus, earthy musk, as well as a ton of
gas in it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas OG is very woody, piney,
maybe some citrus notes depending on which
[SPEAKER_00]: OG you like, and a lot of gas on it as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at that facility, not only do we
create cannabis flavoring extract
[SPEAKER_00]: products, we also research and understand
what makes those things tick, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why they're all unique and different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, so maybe a good place to,
well, first of all, I'm glad that you are,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're an expert on the aromas of cannabis
because I've been, I'm curious,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I think, I was wondering, can you
explain the different types of compounds
[SPEAKER_03]: that contribute to the aromas of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think most people, we like to
think most people are at least familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: with terpenes, and that's what a lot of us
associate with the aromas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But are all the scents associated with
cannabis necessarily terpenes,
[SPEAKER_03]: or are there different classes of those
compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, cannabis produces a wide
variety of flavor compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see everything from terpenes,
sesquiterpenes, terpenoids, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as other flavor compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These may be esters, ketones, albohides,
alcohols, volatile sulfur compounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: the anisulfur compounds we discovered in
our paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole wide variety of different
flavoring isolates and found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you break down terpenes into
things like terpenoids, you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing other of these like alcohols within
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a terpene alcoholic menthol or
linoleal, these are known for minty and
[SPEAKER_00]: more lavender floral scents, as well as
aldehydes like citronella or ketones like
[SPEAKER_00]: Amphor.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just typical flavor isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just different ways of how the
chemicals orient in space, like they have
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen in them, which then gives them more
either potentially pungent or different
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your volatile sulfur compounds always
have sulfur in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those typically tend to be by far the
most pungent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can smell, you know,
when you're driving by a weed grow by the
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky smell, not by, you know,
the minty smell.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, in reading through your
paper, you determine that the the
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds that create the skunky smell are
these volatile sulfur compounds like you
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how did you determine that it was this
new family of volatile sulfur compounds
[SPEAKER_03]: that were creating the smell and not more
of the well-known like isoprene derived
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we didn't know going into it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just we went into the project knowing
that cannabis gas is something that as an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, we don't know definitively what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know skunky gassy smells obviously
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can smell them in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, there was really no
terpene products out there that directly
[SPEAKER_00]: recreated this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no products really on the market
that did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so into the project was, well,
we know there's some strains that have
[SPEAKER_00]: less gas than others or no gas like a Jack
Herrer and some that have a ton of it like
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato and OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just started procuring a lot of
fresh, really high-end genetics because of
[SPEAKER_00]: our extraction facility's license.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the ability to procure from
anybody within the California marketplace
[SPEAKER_00]: and just sort of pulling in lots of
different samples and analyzing them and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for trends to see if we if this
strange smell is gassy another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what are the differences here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is this trend going?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you'll see in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of oriented these from highest
gas to something from like some accio
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato, which anybody's consumed accio
gelato from Scherbinski's extremely gassy,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: By far some of the most pungent weed you
can find on the market all the way down to
[SPEAKER_00]: something that doesn't really have any
skunky smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good, but doesn't have skunky
notes to it like Jack Herrer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really what it's known for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything else in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so tell me a bit more about how
you went about designing the experiment to
[SPEAKER_03]: identify these compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what was novel about your approach
and why hadn't anyone kind of found these
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds before?
[SPEAKER_00]: So your typical testing labs and a lot of
cannabis companies are going to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: like a one-dimensional gas chromatograph
with a mass spectrometer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, I don't know how familiar you are
with it, but GC basically separates based
[SPEAKER_00]: on molecular size in a 1D system and a
mass spectrometer allows you to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: those compounds are, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high throughput, it's affordable,
but it does have its limitations because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're only going to see anywhere from 20
something to maybe cap out at 80 to 100,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how deep you go into your
method development, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas what we have is a custom built out
multi-dimensional gas chromatograph,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows us to only separate based on
molecular size, but also polarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these volatile sulfur
compounds, these oxygenate species,
[SPEAKER_00]: that may come out at the same time as a
terpene, are now able to separate out into
[SPEAKER_00]: the second dimension and make a way better
chemical characterization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have a mass spectrometer on
there and also a sulfur chemiluminescence
[SPEAKER_00]: detector, which allows us to see all those
specific sulfur compounds only on the
[SPEAKER_00]: detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps guide our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really fancy, expensive equipment,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very specialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take a specific science team to
actually run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as easy as a 1D by any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not as high a throughput,
but what you lose on your throughput,
[SPEAKER_00]: you gain on characterization abilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So adding that second dimension enabled
you to get more resolution to see kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe similar weighted compounds that are
different in other ways?
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they'll be similar weighted,
but because they have, say, oxygen in them
[SPEAKER_00]: or sulfur, they're going to separate out
from those compounds that don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen or sulfur in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that one dimensional readout,
it would just look like all the same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a 1D system, if you're running a
typical 1D system, you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously all your peaks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, within one of those peaks,
say at like five minutes, there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: one compound, there could be 20 compounds
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all come out, they all loot out the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no way of separating it into the
second dimension because you're a 1D
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas ours, we pull it into that second
dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's like having, you get a second
layer of separation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm curious, so what other terpenes
kind of come up at a similar time point as
[SPEAKER_03]: these VSCs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were we kind of maybe misappropriating
some of the gas smell to a different
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene just because it has a similar
weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have to look in the data
specifically to see exactly what's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, these VSCs are in very minor
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even on a typical 1D, like you're
talking these VSCs are low part per
[SPEAKER_00]: million, typically in part per billion
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas terpenes are in the percent level,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're talking about the relative
weight to one another, like a mercy,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of strains like an OG is going to be
like, it's a Roma fraction, 60 to 70% may
[SPEAKER_00]: be mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas that volatile sulfur compound is
just your sub percent, your way down
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a typical system, even if you were
looking for it, you're just not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see it because there's such a low
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you have that extra layer
separation, or if you have the right
[SPEAKER_00]: detector to look for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but in this case, a little goes a
long way, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, even if it is,
you know, orders of magnitude lower than
[SPEAKER_03]: those other terpenes, like, that's usually
what breaks through.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the most pungent smell that you
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I mean, just because it has
a lower weight doesn't mean its impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: your sensor is that much lower,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every isolate has a different pungency to
it in sulfur compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur compounds as well as with like
skunk spray itself from like an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: animal skunk itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very pungent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Super, super pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell skunk from miles away at
that point, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things aren't in high
concentrations, but their organoleptic
[SPEAKER_00]: impact how it impacts your taste and
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very high.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, are they more volatile than your
typical terpenes too?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, do they, you know, sort of burn out
fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, yeah, like, like
parenelmarcaptan, one of the main files we
[SPEAKER_00]: detected in cannabis, super volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's definitely more volatile than
like beta-carotene and the sesquiterpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't, I mean, those are volatile,
but they're not as volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't really done extensive
studies to quantify it, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, I'd say, more volatile than
things like kerosene as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that as part of your research
too, you were, you were looking at how
[SPEAKER_03]: these levels of these VSCs change
throughout the plant's life cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping you could talk a bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the paper, we kind of, we also did a
greenhouse experiment where we grew out
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant, monitored the VSC
evolution through from when it was first
[SPEAKER_00]: growing at week, everything from week one
all the way through cure when it was
[SPEAKER_00]: finished curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is around week C weeks,
weeks six and seven is when the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: starts producing these volatile sulfur
compounds, these can of sulfur compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, I mean, we were growing out,
I believe it was gelato specifically in
[SPEAKER_00]: the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, obviously different cultivars are
going to be different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just, cannabis has so many
different cultivars and so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that it's just this wide variety
of potential here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically from what we saw in gelatos
right around week six, seven is when it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then definitely right once cure is
finished, that's when it's at its height.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when there's just so much
concentration of those VSCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Super fresh weed, as you mentioned,
when you're looking for quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically like on like an OG or a
gelato, the fresher it is, the more gassy
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that it tastes better,
has a more perceived euphoric impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a better overall product at that
point and makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that you, you looked also at
the storage conditions for some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers that you got ahold of too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is sort of the optimal storage
conditions to preserve these VSCs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't, we're still looking into
storage conditions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a ton of data on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, if you look at it from,
you're comparing like a mason jar to like
[SPEAKER_00]: a sandwich baggie, two very common,
typical ways people may store cannabis at
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandwich baggies, not exactly conducive to
keeping things away from air, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to off gas a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to leave the baggie because
they're not fully sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas something like a mason jar or any
kind of type of canning jar, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a nice tight seal on it, which
explains why you're able to preserve your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis longer, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what about extracts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the VSCs sort of go through the extract
process?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our paper, we looked at some extracts
because we have an extraction facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some experiments with our
hydrocarbon extractors and we saw that
[SPEAKER_00]: these, these can of sulfur compounds do go
from the flower into the extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're somebody who loves waxes,
whether it be rosins or even hydrocarbon
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts, they're still gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still have that gassy, skunky note to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can smell it there, see notes
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, you know, one part that kind of
stuck out to me in the paper too,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have a nice visualization of this
was the similarity between these cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: VSCs and the VSCs that are also found in
garages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you could speak a bit
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll definitely include a screenshot
or a picture of that visualization that
[SPEAKER_03]: you had, because it's really, it's really
interesting to see just how similar these
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds are.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that cannabis has an extra,
and I'm sorry, I'm not a chemist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it has a few extra lines on there and
I'm sure you can explain what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was actually, we didn't,
this is not something we anticipated at
[SPEAKER_00]: all, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just, we really just want to see,
well, what makes cannabis tick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does this gassy, skunky smell come
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're going through the data,
it was just really strange that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: look as like as a trend from the garlic,
bottle, sulfur compounds, and same as the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis ones, you have very similar
structural motifs going through them all
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as like how the sulfur is oriented
in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has that same thing, but instead
of being an allele, it's a mercaptan
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the extra two methyl compounds
on the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have two more carbon compounds to
it, but the actual sulfur aspect of it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the end, rather it be the terminal bile or
sulfur bonded to a methyl group or being a
[SPEAKER_00]: disulfide or just a sulfide in the middle,
it followed that same trend as what you
[SPEAKER_00]: see in garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these compounds actually in garlic,
like allele files, what's being
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated for its anti-cancerous
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the other files mentioned are
being, have been essentially attributed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cardiovascular beneficial properties
of garlic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that begs the question of like,
does cannabis have similar benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have other medical benefits from
these can of sulfur compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've detected, are they similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more pronounced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this change how cannabis impacts you,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this potentially explain why fresher
cannabis has a bigger impact on the body
[SPEAKER_00]: than say six month, a year old weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any avid consumer will know that and tell
you from, at least from anecdotal
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence, they prefer fresher weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't go to the store and buy eight
month old oregano.
[SPEAKER_00]: You buy, you want fresh oregano for your
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing applies here, but it begs
the question, how does this impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual experience of the product and what
medical benefits are there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a question we don't know the answer
to yet, but love to find out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'd love to find out too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's any listeners who are
looking for something to investigate,
[SPEAKER_03]: to maybe potentially bring to a future
CanMed, this would be a great topic to
[SPEAKER_03]: take on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this really ties back to what you were
saying before too, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where at your business, you're looking to
recreate a lot of the aromas that are
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with these signature strains,
but using compounds that aren't cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: derived.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this a good example of where you
could use some otherwise derived compounds
[SPEAKER_03]: to recreate a cannabis smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so with our research over at
Abstracts Labs, we have our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: license and our instrumentation for
analyzing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our multi-dimensional GC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to see everything that's in the
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's volatile, which attributes
the majority of its flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can take that data and then
recreate it using the same isolates like
[SPEAKER_00]: Prendlemore Captain isn't only found in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be found in other things like when
you look at, say, skunky beers like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Corona, like a Lightstruck beer that has
Prendlemore Captain in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these compounds can be found,
some of them, in other botanical species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can extract these, isolate them
out, and then use them in the same ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: and have the same compounds to directly
recreate that exact same scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Prendlemore Captain, if it's
isolated from cannabis or isolated from,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, hops or some other botanical
species, once you isolate it down in a
[SPEAKER_00]: high enough concentration, it's going to
smell and taste the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just about matching those direct
ratios.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know as part of your paper,
you were trying to reverse engineer some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the aromas of the cultivars that you
were studying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk a bit about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it was interesting that
there seems to be an entourage effect when
[SPEAKER_03]: it comes to aromas as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, with that, we obviously have the
data to know everything that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to recreate it,
isolate by isolate, and see when does it
[SPEAKER_00]: start smelling skunky and gassy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing to see trends in the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole other thing to actually
experience it and confirm this is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take the major terpenes,
things like Miracene, Limonene,
[SPEAKER_00]: Heroxylene, Terpenoline, Pionene,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Start adding those in the right ratios
that we're seeing in, say, Bacchia or
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just kind of going down the list and
adding in other terpenes or flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identifying and noticing when does it
become that skunky, gassy aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just Prenomer Captain by
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Prenomer Captain, as well as some of
their can of sulfur compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: are a huge driver for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also need those terpenes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have those terpenes and
terpenoids, it's not going to smell like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to smell like that
signature gassy scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to smell very sulfurous,
maybe potentially a little bit caddy or
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not like the cannabis gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you would notice in an OG or Gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's what the cannabis community loves
so much, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really what we were doing,
just utilizing that data and just slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: going down and just trying to identify one
by one what's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this with just terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it with just the VSCs, as well as
then adding the VSCs to the terpenes to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what is that scent that we're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you mentioned that it is such a
signature aroma and one that the community
[SPEAKER_03]: loves so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it has to be part of the
reason why, you know, the what is the
[SPEAKER_03]: original skunk always seems to be to come
up on social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just interesting how that skunk
smell has become just so synonymous with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super polarizing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis community loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who don't consume cannabis a lot of
times hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just really put off by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may prefer strains if they're new
consumers in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for something a little bit
fruitier, more like Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But regardless, I mean, mindless research
kind of elucidate potential health
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits to look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously calls out exactly where these
scents come from, but provides guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: for people who are trying to do odor
mitigation or controlling the odor on
[SPEAKER_00]: their on their growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, they're not upsetting the
general community around you, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't lose sight of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, our community really enjoys
this scent, but a lot of the population
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very pungent scent that does
permeate everywhere it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, drive through downtown L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of cannabis grows and you'll
smell just driving on the freeways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you said earlier, I mean,
that is the scent that people associate
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you if you smell a more
fruity strain out there in the wild,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not immediately going to think
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you when you smell that gas,
like there's no mistaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm curious, too, like with your
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, your business is in recreating
aromas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So was there a lot of demand for creating
this scent in particular?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's always been a critique of
botanical terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to shy away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's one of the critiques on
social media is that botanical terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: may capture some aromas of cannabis do
really well, like hazes and Jack Herrera
[SPEAKER_00]: type strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it came to OGs, it was
significantly lacking that it missed that
[SPEAKER_00]: signature gassy, skunky aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And scientifically, I mean, I was just
interested in why.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we kind of pursued this project
and being able to actually recreating that
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and fragrance format allows brands
now to, like I said, take their product
[SPEAKER_00]: across state markets, across state lines,
country lines and have that exact flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and aroma now because we can directly
recreate it using these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm being wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very expensive ton of work, a lot of time
to recreate that exact profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you do, I mean, it's really
rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people who you've created
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the stories I like to show
people or tell people about is when we
[SPEAKER_00]: first started making these discoveries,
when we were reverse engineering and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreating these products, we started
formulating some vape pens at our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did some with CBD, start handing
them out to people and they start smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: through and tasting them compared to just
regular botanical blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they would smoke the ones that
had all the compounds in there from all
[SPEAKER_00]: the reverse engineering work, some folks
back, oh, this is a really nice live resin
[SPEAKER_00]: pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, well, it's not a live resin pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually botanical terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just been able to identify and
really pull in all the different flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates that previously had been
undiscovered in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're able to really recreate
it and make the product taste like live
[SPEAKER_00]: resin, I mean, just as a scientist is just
so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to finally figure those things
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's quite the vote of confidence
to be the seal of approval to get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before we started talking,
you were talking about how it's great at
[SPEAKER_03]: your facility or it's great that
management of your team has this publish
[SPEAKER_03]: first sort of mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, a lot of other folks
who would have made this discovery,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially in your field, may have held
back that information and not made it
[SPEAKER_03]: public.
[SPEAKER_03]: So speak a bit about why you thought it
was important to share this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I'm very blessed here at
Abstracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an ownership team that really
believes in educating the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community and sharing this information
that's so important to the community and
[SPEAKER_00]: that science team as well that really,
really buys into that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we made these discoveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're in a typical privatized
industry, it's very common that most of
[SPEAKER_00]: your work doesn't get published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you get a patent here and there when
it's possible, but the rest gets filed
[SPEAKER_00]: away in the basement and never see the
light of day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the approach here with Abstracts,
our ownership is, A, we have a community
[SPEAKER_00]: that really wants to see this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it really benefits the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as this is a plant that
historically hasn't been researched very
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be due to, you know,
it's pretty difficult to research at a
[SPEAKER_00]: university setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go through a lot of red tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really have access to all the
different cultivars that are on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: like we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we found these cool
discoveries out, we thought, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: the community will really love to see
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to publish it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't discover the gas and not tell
the community about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be, I mean, such a travesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry did not show this information
to the whole world and educate the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the community really loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody fully bought into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at reading the paper,
really appreciated all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully it just encourages more
folks to publish as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as a community, there's not a lot
of science out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the universities can't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, they can research cannabis,
but they can't research cannabis that's
[SPEAKER_00]: grown by like a Shervinsky's or Cookies,
Jack Herr, any of the major brands that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeing in all these states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these are not strains that the
universities can research, but we can as a
[SPEAKER_00]: privatized community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have actual licensed
facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think that we at
Medicinal Genomics kind of share that same
[SPEAKER_03]: philosophy and that's always been our
approach is to publish and get the
[SPEAKER_03]: information out there to benefit the
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's part of the reason why we put
together CanMed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is to bring together these other people or
other companies who are sort of taking up
[SPEAKER_03]: the mantle for getting research going on
this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like you said, there are
universities that are coming on,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're studying hemp, which is very
valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it's going to apply also to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're right in terms of really
looking at these well-known cultivars that
[SPEAKER_03]: are purely cannabis and are not going to
be mistaken for hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really up to the private companies to
do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I mentioned in the beginning
of this big fan of Medicinal Genomics for
[SPEAKER_00]: a while here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love all the work you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great to educate and support
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only helps better serve our community
by having people who are more educated on
[SPEAKER_00]: their products, helps them make buying
decisions when they're looking for things
[SPEAKER_00]: that may house a plant that's going to
impact them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What flavors are they looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer just love to get to a plant
where it's no longer just strained names,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Embarrassing strained names, but actually
how do these things smell and taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do these things impact you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's so many cultivars out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so wildly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, I mean, there's a ton of
work to be done, but that's what makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: so much fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to get beyond just straight
THC values too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was just THC values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would Jack hair impact you different?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, anybody who's an avid consumer can
tell you the difference and how it impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: you, especially when it's fresh,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So winding down here, TJ, before I let you
go, I wanted to give you a chance to plug
[SPEAKER_03]: any social media or websites or other
resources that you think that the
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners would be interested in learning
more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can follow our social media at
abstracts tech on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we post a lot of our product launches,
where our research goes, any educational
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces or collaborative work we do,
as well as our website, abstractstech.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's abstracts with an X, by the way,
not a CT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on abstractstech.com, you can buy all
of our different terpene products,
[SPEAKER_00]: really be typical flavor blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we do create traditional flavors as
well as our cannabis inspired products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on there to republish all of our
white papers and our different PRV
[SPEAKER_00]: publications as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some really interesting ones on
there that your community may enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we did do a white paper looking at
what is the difference between flower
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbon extracts and rosin extracts of
the exact same, exact same cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: same lot, but applied different extraction
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the different flavor and
terpene isolates found in each and how
[SPEAKER_00]: those changed the trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we can, I mean, cause we all know
they do have different flavor profiles and
[SPEAKER_00]: why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went ahead and looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely something to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do publish it on our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will definitely be checking that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
