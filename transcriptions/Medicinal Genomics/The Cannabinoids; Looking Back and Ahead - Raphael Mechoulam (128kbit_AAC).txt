[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, thank you very much indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for getting up so early in the
morning to hear a scientific lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try to give an overview of what we
know in several fields of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: research and I'll be delighted to answer
any questions that you may have at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why my title, the title of the
lecture is Looking Back and Ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well looking back will give us some
background of what's going on at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment and looking ahead is, well let's
hope that we're looking ahead to better
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines, we're looking ahead of helping
a lot of patients in a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this was not what went on many years
ago when we started work and many years
[SPEAKER_00]: means about 50 years ago, I was just
appointed to one of the institutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: a research institutes in Israel and as I'm
a natural products chemist, I was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for interesting projects in the field of
natural products, chemistry and
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacology and one of the topics I chose
was looking into the chemistry,
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacology and later hopefully
biochemistry of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was surprised, very surprised to
find out that while we knew quite a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about morphine which had been isolated
from opium many, many decades previously
[SPEAKER_00]: and the same was true for cocaine from
coca leaves, the chemistry of cannabis was
[SPEAKER_00]: not well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, the active product or
products had never been isolated in a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: form, the structure was unknown and this
is not just an academic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: today it is impossible to do
pharmacological or biochemical or clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: work unless we know exactly what we're
working on, I mean you cannot do a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials and tell a patient take
cannabis and then publish it because
[SPEAKER_00]: physician today and rightly so will not
accept it as data, they want a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically based quantitative data and
they want to know rightly so what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on exactly and so the starting point was,
still is, let's start with the chemistry,
[SPEAKER_00]: elucidate the chemistry and go ahead into
biochemistry, pharmacology and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials but there was completely,
there was no interest at all, as a matter
[SPEAKER_00]: of fact when we started working,
we couldn't get a grant from NOQA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was unpleasant, we had to do
everything, a colleague of mine or a few
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues of mine and myself,
we had to do everything by ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was absolutely no interest
whatsoever, as a matter of fact at the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific institute where I was working,
telling me why don't you work on peptides,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's much more important than looking at a
plant out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now things are different,
when we were asked last year to write a
[SPEAKER_00]: review in Nature, Nature Neuroscience on
cannabis and they had actually four
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews, one after the other on the same
topic on cannabis and different aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, one came out with a history and
background, they put it on the front cover
[SPEAKER_00]: with, as you can see with the brain from
which cannabis is, coming out,
[SPEAKER_00]: well things have changed, I can see so
many people coming here at half past eight
[SPEAKER_00]: in the morning to hear scientific lecture,
it couldn't have happened 30, 40 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why is the interest there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a review recently published by
two NIH scientists, very distinguished
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists and they say, amongst many
other things, modulating endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: activity may have therapeutic potential in
almost all diseases affecting humans and
[SPEAKER_00]: they give a long list of diseases and a
huge number of references which I've taken
[SPEAKER_00]: out and you can see it's
neurodegenerative, inflammatory,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera, psychiatric,
cancer and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do not know any other biochemical
system, biological system which we can say
[SPEAKER_00]: that it has therapeutic potential in
almost all diseases affecting humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is very, very unusual, we cannot say
this for the dopaminergic system,
[SPEAKER_00]: we cannot say this for the serotonergic
system, it is something else entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, even if it is only 70,
80, 90% true, it is still of great
[SPEAKER_00]: interest and I assume that this is one of
the reasons why so many people are now
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in the cannabinoid system from
many points of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try to summarize some of the
things that I see as interesting but let
[SPEAKER_00]: me start back a few years ago,
three, four thousand years ago with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Assyrians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually knew quite a bit and we know
that they knew because they left evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the other tribes that were around,
most of the other nations that were around
[SPEAKER_00]: at that time didn't leave that much
evidence but the Assyrians left the
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence in stone and so we can read it as
long as it has not been destroyed by those
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy people now fighting it there but
this particular one is in London so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they had the name for cannabis
depending on its activity rather than on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant itself and they called it Gansi
Gunu and I had somebody, an Assyrian
[SPEAKER_00]: scholar translated for me and it said that
it is the drug that takes away the mind
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not a bad definition,
probably better than pot or something else
[SPEAKER_00]: but the drug that takes away the mind is
just for the psychoactivity but when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was used for a clinical, when the use was
clinical and we are not exactly sure what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of diseases they were treating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that they were treating
neurological diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it Hazalu and they also used it
in religious rites which I understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: also not unknown here but if we jump ahead
a few years, 2,000 years ahead,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that the Romans and the Greeks also
use it but surprisingly not for the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactivity and I think that it can be
well explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: European cannabis, hemp really,
does not contain THC and therefore they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't see any psychoactivity otherwise
I'm sure that the Romans would have used
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really tried to find ways to enjoy
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Pliny said that they are good for
pain and the Ascoridus said that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: good for inflammation and the Ascoridus
was a major influence over 2,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The book of the Ascoridus on drugs was
really repeated and translated and copied
[SPEAKER_00]: and people used it until the mid-19th
century but if we jump another 2,000 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, the physician of Queen Victoria
called Russell Reynolds used to get
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from India for Queen Victoria
that suffered from migraines and he found
[SPEAKER_00]: that a European cannabis was not good for
her but Indian cannabis was very good for
[SPEAKER_00]: her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under certain circumstances, migraines can
be treated or can be prevented or the
[SPEAKER_00]: activity or the action of the migraine can
be lowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have known a lot about cannabis but
as you are well aware, then interest
[SPEAKER_00]: probably was there to a certain extent but
because of legal problems and because of
[SPEAKER_00]: supply problems, not much was done
although too major groups worked on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the 30s, Roger Adams in the US
and Alex Stott who got the Nobel Prize for
[SPEAKER_00]: work in something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They worked on it but they never succeeded
in actually isolating the main compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: there and therefore work didn't go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got from the police and in all my early
papers, I say thanks to the police which
[SPEAKER_00]: is not very usual in scientific papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a cannabis or hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashish is a cannabis that's grown in
Lebanon and put in small bags and smuggled
[SPEAKER_00]: so we got part of the smuggled material
and we started extracting the smuggled
[SPEAKER_00]: material and using modern methods or at
least methods that were modern at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time, we were able to isolate a huge
number of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is maybe the reason why science
or why chemistry had not developed until
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mixture is so complicated that people
or scientists, chemists were not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify to isolate the compounds in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started isolating individual
compounds and we were surprised to see
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are a huge number of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those of you that remember their
chemistry will see that these compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: are closely related if you wish and we
gave their names depending on the terp in
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it cannabigerol and we called it
cannabicyclole and cannabichromine and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on but although today they are known about
oh, say 50, 60, maybe 80 compounds of this
[SPEAKER_00]: type, two of them have been investigated
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the major ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two of them are cannabidiol,
CBD, and tetrahydrocannabinol and only one
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, the THC, it causes the
psychoactivity so there has been a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of work over the last decade I
would say on THC, somewhat less on CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol because it doesn't cause the
psychoactivity and therefore the people
[SPEAKER_00]: were less interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now nowadays it seems that actually
interest is going on more on cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_00]: because of its therapeutic activities and
not being toxic and not being
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be administered to patients at huge
amounts without any side effects so there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot of interest in cannabidiol and I
hope to have the time to tell you of some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the work we and others have been doing
on both compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what do we, at that time,
what did we mean by active?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we didn't know much about the
activity so we tried it on rhesus monkeys
[SPEAKER_00]: and only one compound, THC, caused
sedation to the monkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have one of the monkeys without
getting any material, very active,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit dangerous to get near it,
it can bite you but the other one injected
[SPEAKER_00]: with about three milligrams total dose of
THC became sedated and my students usually
[SPEAKER_00]: say that, well, that particular rhesus
monkey looks like a professor thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the next nearly 20 years a lot
of people looked at these compounds and we
[SPEAKER_00]: got to know a lot about the mechanism,
the biochemistry, the pharmacology of
[SPEAKER_00]: these two compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that was not known and there was
a mistake in the literature was the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a mistake in the literature,
a group at Oxford in the UK, a major
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacological group decided or wrote or
brought some evidence that THC acts in a
[SPEAKER_00]: nonspecific manner, maybe dissolving a
nerve or dissolving the nerve sheet and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on and that's why it acts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was not a very great interest and
people didn't do much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we didn't think that that's correct
and we found evidence that actually it is
[SPEAKER_00]: not correct and therefore there should be
something more specific, whether it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme, whether the cannabinoids work on
an enzyme, work on a receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: work in some other biological way and a
group here in the US, Alin Howlett,
[SPEAKER_00]: did some excellent work and found the
first receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that receptor was found in the brain
in exactly those areas that are relevant,
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that have to do with movement
control, with body movement coordination,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning and memory, higher cognitive
function, reward pathways and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was exactly the areas of the brain
one would expect a receptor to be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we know that receptors are not found
just because there is a plant out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work that way, otherwise we'll
have a fantastic number of receptors in
[SPEAKER_00]: the brain and it is not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a limited number of receptors and
they're there because we, or animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: produce specific compounds that bind to
these receptors, activate them or block
[SPEAKER_00]: their activity and that's the way
receptors work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to go out and find the compounds
that we produce and these compounds would
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulate or block the activity of the
receptor that Alin Howlett had found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you find a receptor?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not found in great quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally it's found in very small amounts,
frequently like endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're found, they're formed when and
where needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would expect to have absolutely
minimal amounts, not very simple to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how does one do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, one takes a compound that is
very potent and in this case we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: compound that's extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it HU, HU is Hebrew University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took that compound, which is very
potent, labeled it and tried to get it to
[SPEAKER_00]: bind to the receptor, which it does,
and then we tried fractions from the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: that will kick out this particular labeled
compound from its binding to the receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: and those areas that do that, then we can
take them from the particular area of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain and try to analyze it and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to tell about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us two or three years to do it,
a lot of work because it turned out that
[SPEAKER_00]: the compounds ultimately are not very
stable, but after two years or three years
[SPEAKER_00]: of work, my post-docs Bill Devane and
others found, and we were able with some
[SPEAKER_00]: modern equipment to determine the
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the two structures, we found out two
compounds which are present in our brain
[SPEAKER_00]: and in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one we called anandamide,
ananda in Sanskrit is supreme joy and we
[SPEAKER_00]: thought, probably correctly to a certain
extent, we thought that it may be involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in our enjoyment of the effects and we
called it indeed anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one we should have called ananda
ester, but we are not sure at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning that it is indeed a natural
product, so we called it 2-HG and it
[SPEAKER_00]: turned out that both compounds are the
major endogenous cannabinoids in our body,
[SPEAKER_00]: in our brain, and THC in fact mimics the
activity of these endogenous compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have endogenous compounds of
extreme interest, at least to us of
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme interest, and these two compounds
are being mimicked in their activity by
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we had a good basis and it has been
supported by hundreds of papers and there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot of interest in these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those few that remember their
chemistry will see that anandamide and
[SPEAKER_00]: 2-HG endogenous compounds are completely
different structurally from
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrahydrocannabinol and yet they bind to
the same receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're essentially equivalent in their
activity although THC stays for a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: time in the body because it has to be
metabolized and takes some time and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why the activity is prolonged while
anandamide and 2-HG are formed when and
[SPEAKER_00]: where needed, not throughout the brain,
not throughout the body, when and where
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause whatever they have to cause,
lower pain or do something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they are broken by specific
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have now a system which has become
quite complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we have the two receptors,
one of them causes the psychoactivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other one, and I'll try to talk a
little bit about the second one,
[SPEAKER_00]: does not cause any psychoactivity,
but it is a protective enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be a receptor that has to do
in parallel, if you wish, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a protective mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activation of the CB2 receptor is a
protective measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The immune system guards us against
mostly, it does all kinds of other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it guards us mostly against proteins,
microbes coming from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are many things that are not
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular system complements the
activity of the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have two receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two major endogenous compounds
that affect these two receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have enzymes that
[SPEAKER_00]: form these endogenous compounds and
enzymes that break down these endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can work on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we suppress one of them, those that
form the endogenous cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we have lower amounts of those
endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we suppress the enzymes that break down
these two endogenous cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we have higher levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of possibilities,
and this is what happens in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC acts as the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really do not know when and where
cannabidiol works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some indications in many diseases,
in many different physiological states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that particular activity,
how cannabidiol works, but there is
[SPEAKER_00]: something missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still, I'm not sure how cannabidiol
works in all cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we discovered, and many other
groups also discovered that, that in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to anandamide and 2-AG,
there is a huge, huge number of compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: closely related chemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, anandamide is a simple compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a fatty acid, and the body there are
about 20 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a fatty acid bound to amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of, a few changes,
but that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fatty acid bound to amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a few fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can bind to each other, and therefore
we have something like 200 of them in our
[SPEAKER_00]: brain, in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know very little about the activity
of these 200 or 150, 200 compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them present in minute amounts,
some are present in somewhat larger
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are starting to learn about them,
and it turns out that those that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated, all of them, all of those
that have been investigated have some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of activity, not necessarily cannabinoid
type activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have all kinds of other
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the field is becoming very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so many compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why does the body make so many
compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Difficult to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it has something to do with other
things that I have happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it has to do with our personality,
the formation of our personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an endocannabinoid system which
is becoming quite complicated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and changes of this endocannabinoid system
may lead to pathological state,
[SPEAKER_00]: to diseases of one type and another,
and we have to learn that in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: modify the changes which cause the
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after making things very complicated,
I'll try to go into specific diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you wish, but let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do the endocannabinoids do?
[SPEAKER_00]: My good friend, DeMarzo, said,
well, that was almost 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the endocannabinoids call a person
to relax, eat, sleep, forget, and protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can see that out of these five
activities, four are certainly positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: relax, eat, sleep, protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget is not so positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go into a supermarket and you see
500 people there, you definitely don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to remember all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forgetting is also positive,
as long as it is in the right way of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know that it's much more
complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a slide that I prepared some
years, a year ago, and we have a short
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can probably add another 20 activities,
and the endocannabinoid system is involved
[SPEAKER_00]: from anxiety, appetite, blood pressure,
et cetera, et cetera, down to movement
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder, neuro protection, pain,
reproduction, stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is essentially all, essentially all
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there are any changes in the
endocannabinoid system, we can see changes
[SPEAKER_00]: in that kind of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not a very simple situation,
certainly not a very simple situation for
[SPEAKER_00]: a clinician who cannot treat all of these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try to show how specific these
changes can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not go into the biochemistry,
not go into the physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention just one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, a nerve is not a string from
one place to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have breaks in that string,
if you wish, and the break is in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: make possible regulation of the signal,
signal that goes from one place to another
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this break is called a synapse,
and we have the presynapse and the
[SPEAKER_00]: synaptic part and the postsynaptic part,
and the movement, the movement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: signal from one part to another is
chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chemicals that go from the
presynapse to the postsynapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the body does it more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to regulate that movement of
chemicals, dopamine or any others,
[SPEAKER_00]: or glutamate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it regulate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways is by the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoids, when needed,
are formed on the postsynapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move from the postsynapse to the
presynapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bind to their own receptors,
and then they can block the release of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotransmitters from the presynapse to
the postsynapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to the activity,
their own activity, the activity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids to the presynapse,
they also regulate the activity of many
[SPEAKER_00]: other neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they have so many
activities, because they have activities
[SPEAKER_00]: of their own, and they also regulate the
activities of quite a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are becoming very complicated,
but I will not go into that part of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid research, but we'll go and
speak about specific situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical situations, like neuroprotection.
[SPEAKER_00]: My good friend, Esti Shohami, she's a
specialist in brain trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the levels of one of the
endocannabinoids after brain trauma in
[SPEAKER_00]: mice, and we saw that one of the
endocannabinoid, the 2-AG, goes up nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: tenfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: After brain trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that just because the brain has been
traumatized and doesn't know what it does,
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it just a reaction of the brain in
order to lower the damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red thing you can see here shows
the level of 2-AG after the brain trauma,
[SPEAKER_00]: after four hours, quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought, well, let's see whether
it's a protective mechanism so we
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesized enough 2-AG and gave it to
traumatized mice, and went on to look
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the damage that has been done on
the brain goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, I will not go into great
details, we did all kinds of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we gave these brains to the
histologist, and they were surprised to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out that those brains, the brains of
mice that had been administered 2-AG had
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% less damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the damage, the white part in
the brain, those that received 2-AG have
[SPEAKER_00]: much less white part, that's a damaged
part, that's a dead part, if you wish,
[SPEAKER_00]: than the controls that didn't receive
2-AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was done several times,
that was published in Nature quite a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we believe, we strongly believe
that these compounds are neuroprotective
[SPEAKER_00]: after brain trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why this has not advanced to clinical
trials, although we completed quite a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of work on that, and other people have
done also work on that, I have no idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is something quite general.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of interesting data in mice,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has not progressed further,
although brain damage contusions are of
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, not nowadays, they always have
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about actions that go through the CB1
receptor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those clinicians here, or general
public knows that cancer chemotherapy,
[SPEAKER_00]: although it may be very valuable at times,
causes side effects, again, at times,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are very, very unpleasant,
and we decided to try THC in cases of
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer chemotherapy in children.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in close touch with a colleague of
mine, heads of department of pediatric
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer in one of the hospitals,
and of course, she was telling me about
[SPEAKER_00]: the tragic situation of children getting
cancer chemotherapy, being crying most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, and feeling terrible,
and it was a tragic for them, and for the
[SPEAKER_00]: families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we do something?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to try THC and do a double
blind study.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of the children will get a placebo,
50% will get THC, in addition to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer chemotherapy, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a week, she came back to me and
said, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly who is getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe double blind, or triple blind,
or four times blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly who is getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that are getting the THC do not
vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that are not getting it,
feel terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she did an open study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ultimately published it, and we found
that, indeed, THC given to those children
[SPEAKER_00]: in olive oil, under the tongue,
helped essentially 100% of the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very strange, because one doesn't see in
clinical trials 100% of activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's what she found.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published it, and I believe that it's
being used here and there, but not enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's innocuous, and we can help children
suffering from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't move the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we tried something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that feeding, eating, eating,
is affected by cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pups were injected with an antagonist
to the system, to the CB1, and we saw that
[SPEAKER_00]: the pups did not go to the mother and did
not suck anymore, although they obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: should have sucked in order to remain
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sat around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their brothers and sisters did that,
and continues growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that didn't just sat around,
and after a week or so would die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the cannabinoid system is
important in sucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, if we block it, they don't
suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we, in the middle, after two or
three days and see that pups are not
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking, we give them THC in large
amounts, they will start again and go
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, it's a very important factor
in child feeding and sucking in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a company looked at that,
and they also saw that in cases of AIDS,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, if AIDS are given THC,
the patients remain at their weight for a
[SPEAKER_00]: much longer time than those that got
placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the company, Sanofi, had an antagonist,
and they gave it to overweight patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they knew that that's a huge number of
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: in most of the western countries,
and they'll have a huge number of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make a lot of money, and they
developed this particular compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: called it remonabant, and they put it on
the market, and after just a few weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: they took it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that was they didn't
think enough about the other effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoid system has to do with
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lowers anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you give an antagonist,
it not only blocks appetite or lowers the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of food one takes, but it also
enhances anxiety because we block the
[SPEAKER_00]: system, the system which has to do with
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite a few patients became anxious,
and I believe that one or two wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: commit suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard rumors that this was so,
and they took it out of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so we have to know quite a lot
before doing something of that sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they should have told the patients,
if you're anxious, don't take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyway, remonabant was taken out of
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another effect that we worked on,
and this was a small clinical trial on
[SPEAKER_00]: Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are quite a lot of patients with
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had about 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were soldiers who had been
involved, and maybe a friend of theirs was
[SPEAKER_00]: killed next to them, and they went into a
post-trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two women that were raped.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two men and a woman,
I think, that were involved in a traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started giving them THC,
five milligrams a day, twice or three
[SPEAKER_00]: times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clinician who did that work,
Dr. Roitman, a psychiatrist, he,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I said, gave them five milligrams per
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at a lot of the effects,
and there are all kinds of clinical things
[SPEAKER_00]: that people that are involved in PTSD have
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wrote them down and looked at the
frequency of nightmares, the sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, the global symptoms, severity,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, he found that there were
positive effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't see any complete elimination of
the PTSD, but he saw a great improvement,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: These patients frequently cannot sleep or
are afraid to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are afraid that they will
recall the effect that caused,
[SPEAKER_00]: the trauma that caused this effect,
whether it was a rape or whether it was an
[SPEAKER_00]: accident, whether it was a person killed
next to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that it can be used,
it should be used, in a way that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: help PTSD patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the CB2 receptor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is more interesting, because the CB2
does not cause any side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I said, I believe that the CB2
system parallels, to a large extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can do a lot of things in which
external proteins are not involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, there are long lists of
effects which certainly show in that
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that the CB2 system,
the research on the CB2 system,
[SPEAKER_00]: will lead us to a lot of information
showing that the two systems together,
[SPEAKER_00]: the immune system and the CB2 action,
work together and are of major importance
[SPEAKER_00]: to what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we have prepared synthetic
compounds which act only on the CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these compounds do not bind to the CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the numbers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, the fact is they do not bind to
the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bind only to the CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, they can be used,
hopefully, as drugs in the CB2 system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And work that has been done at NIH by a
group has shown that one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, which we call HU910,
attenuates inflammation, lowers damage
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with hepatic reperfusion,
injury, and does all kinds of positive
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that the CB2, specific CB2
action will be of considerable importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite a few, both academic labs and
industrial labs, are looking at the CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of its lack of side effects,
it has been shown to act in Crohn's
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, in inflammatory bowel disease,
in asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this is in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, no clinical trials,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important or most interesting,
most advanced thing is actually work on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, no, cannabidiol does not cause
any side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not bind to the receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen that it acts on anxiety,
very good action in anxiety in many cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen that in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mice are anxious all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're afraid of cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're afraid of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If positive, they stay in a dark part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is something called the elevated
plus maze, which is a meter above the
[SPEAKER_00]: place where a mouse can be in the dark,
or it can get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount of time it gets out of the
dark place shows the lowering of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that work in
psychopharmacology are using this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that, indeed, cannabidiol,
as well derivatives cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lower the anxiety of mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we well know, cannabidiol also
lowers the anxiety in humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we don't have many clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have just one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inflammation, a good friend of mine,
and together with a group in the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: the person that did the work in the UK was
in London at that time, and now he's at
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that, indeed, cannabidiol
lowers rheumatoid arthritis in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we saw something which seems to
be quite typical for cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's at, okay, 2.5 milligrams per
kilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: At five milligrams per kilo, which is the
red one on the bottom, yes, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very positive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't explain how we get a clinical
score, but we get a very good effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if we go to higher doses,
we get less effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have something which is a
double phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, nothing at a very low level,
quite a bit of activity at a somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: higher level, but then the activity
disappears if the concentration of the
[SPEAKER_00]: drug has gone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not very simple to lead us to
clinical trials because we have to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of material that will be
relevant to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it should be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this particular disease, arthritis,
is an autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body attacks its own body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, okay, if it works on this kind
of arthritis, maybe it will work in
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes type 1, which is also an
autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body attacks the cells that produce
insulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although there are drugs that work in
diabetes type 1, insulin by itself works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can have a new type of drug,
which will be very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, when we gave cannabidiol to a
strain of mice that all of them develop
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes type 1, we saw extremely good
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started giving the drug after the
mice were already developing the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is to say they are during the 12th or
13th week of their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start developing diabetes type
1, their body attacks the cells that
[SPEAKER_00]: produce insulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally, 80% to 100% of these mice
get the disease and they die from the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we give cannabidiol at relatively high
doses, we see that only 30% of the mice
[SPEAKER_00]: get the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here, really, it is open to clinical
trials because the disease in this case is
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a simple model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a situation which the body
attacks the cells that produce insulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what happens in diabetes type 1 in
human patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to do a clinical trial
essentially at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, although we published
that quite some years ago, it has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very unfortunate because I believe that
here we have an open situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look, don't forget everything
else, just the percent intact islets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells that produce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The controls, only 8% of the cells are
still intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we give CBD, 76%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 77% of the cells that produce insulin are
intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have a good explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see no reason why it shouldn't
happen in humans as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shall have a lecture on epilepsy later
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's try to tell you of something
that we did more than 35 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: After looking at animals in animal trials,
we decided to go into epilepsy in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took 15 epileptic patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing was helping them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were separated into those that got the
placebo and those that got the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of those that got the drug,
we gave them for four and a half months
[SPEAKER_00]: pure cannabidiol at very high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that was not simple because I had to
prepare in the lab about 400 grams,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost half a kilo of pure cannabidiol,
which it's not very simple for an academic
[SPEAKER_00]: lab to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got the 400 grams, sent them to
South America and they did that and found
[SPEAKER_00]: that four patients out of eight remained
almost completely free of seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three had a partial improvement and
one showed no improvement, which was what
[SPEAKER_00]: one would expect in a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the placebo people continue
to have their seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, 35 years ago, well here we
have a small trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be expanded by a clinical group
or by a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can have a new anti-epileptic
drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that not all epileptic
patients are helped by the drugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: exist at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 35, for almost 30 years, nothing
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody bothered to repeat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody bothered to go ahead and give it to
adults or children.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then parents that had epileptic
children, nothing was helping them,
[SPEAKER_00]: learned of this paper, learned of
observations that showed that,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, some cannabis strains with a lot of
cannabidiol help, let's try it because
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing else helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been a lot of individual
cases in which patients, parents have
[SPEAKER_00]: given the drug to their children and it
has helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there has been quite a lot of noise
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular, and therefore two years ago
a clinical trial was started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand the results are quite
positive at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Israel, cannabidiol strains,
cannabidiol containing strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: are officially allowed to be administered,
to be given to children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are quite a lot of children that
get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is also happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it shouldn't have waited 35 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been done 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why it didn't?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much that an academic lab can
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the situation with quite a few
of the things I am describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schizophrenia, slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have shown that in individual cases
cannabidiol, very high doses, helps with
schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a German group did a relatively major
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at schizophrenia and they
found that indeed cannabidiol is
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent to one of the major drugs that
are being used today in schizophrenia with
[SPEAKER_00]: one small difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the results were the same between
the drug that is being used today and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol, the drug that is being used
today has side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these drugs have side effects,
strong side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabidiol had no side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, they compared CBD with
Ami-Cell-Pride and they found that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same type of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sincerely hope that cannabidiol will
be used in schizophrenic patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't heard of any additional
clinical studies, although the German
[SPEAKER_00]: paper was published about four and a half
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will end, because of lack of time,
with graft-versus-cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a man-caused disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many patients with certain cancers have
their bone marrow transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this causes serious side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the patients are very sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the disease is basically, again,
a disease in which the body attacks its
[SPEAKER_00]: own body.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the body attacks something
that we have transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the transplant itself attacks the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on is that the person is
very sick in cases of children,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen children that have transplanted
bone marrow and they're in a terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, one cannot stand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was found that it lowers the
effects by nearly 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 100 patients that served as control,
we had 46% with GVHD, with a disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: and only 12% in those that got
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those that really had a bad,
bad case, this is called a three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: grade of GVHD, we lowered that from 10% to
5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now a further clinical trial is going
on with many more patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think that I have to stop here
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have quite a few other things I would
have liked to tell you, like new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol type compounds and some
regulation vasodilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just mention one thing, the
endocannabinoids like anandamide,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are additional compounds,
as I mentioned, first was I said at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, quite a lot of additional
compounds which do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top, you can see anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom, you can see a compound
called arachidonoid serine, which are not
[SPEAKER_00]: very different structurally, but they do
completely different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that investigations will go on
with these compounds and we shall know
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a lot about them within the next few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to summarize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoids are involved in a
large number of physiological processes
[SPEAKER_00]: with both THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are those compounds which I didn't
have enough time to discuss that are fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: acids bound to amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to learn a lot about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they're extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, we know very little about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that specific CB2 agonists will
lead to new types of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank the collaborators in
Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on the left, people that
worked in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collaborate with a lot of colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab is essentially a chemical lab,
but I collaborate with people that work in
[SPEAKER_00]: bones, in traumas and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work with a large number of
colleagues abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Pertwee in the UK and you can see
bone and the Czech state and many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: They visit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I visit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we drink a lot of coffee together and
we enjoy exchanging information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've visited all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy going to their labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to all of them except one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Maslov in Siberia had a meeting a few
months ago in February and he wrote me
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you don't have to worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's minus 35 centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's only 25 centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a few minutes for questions,
folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you'd like to ask the doctor a
question, please step up to one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: mics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions at all?
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to have a few questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm clear, you're saying we have found
anandamide, these endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: and now we're finding 200 more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're sorting out that code to all
those endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there being a correlation made just the
way anandamide correlates with THC?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we seeing or are we studying the
correlation of all those other
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoids and associating them with
the action or chemical structure of all
[SPEAKER_04]: the other endocannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: From what we know at the moment,
anandamide or THC mimics anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mimic the other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body is lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it knows how to make anandamide,
it makes a lot of other compounds going to
[SPEAKER_00]: the same enzyme system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the compounds that are formed aren't
necessarily endocannabinoids in their
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do all kinds of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is known throughout our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the steroid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the body knows how to make the
steroid, by making small changes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: steroid, you get different type of
compounds, estrogens that work as female
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have compounds that have nothing
to do with estrogen, again with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: basic structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the same basic structure,
an amino acid bound to a fatty acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has completely different
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we have 150 compounds of that type,
who knows what they're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, yes, anandamide that is being
mimicked by THC, but we also have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other compounds of which we know just a
tiny little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One compound that I may discuss this
afternoon is a compound which we found
[SPEAKER_00]: that has to do with osteoporosis,
and it blocks the destruction of bones
[SPEAKER_00]: after a certain age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have something completely
different, and yet it goes following the
[SPEAKER_00]: same chemical system, because the body
knows how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to make a correlation, you've
discovered this endochemical that affects
[SPEAKER_04]: osteoporosis, and then would there be a
logical jump then to CBG, or another
[SPEAKER_04]: phytocannabinoid that is known as bone
growth stimulator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the answer is yes, probably yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question for you, Dr. Mishulam,
is how much research are you doing
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically with terpenes, and terpenes
in conjunction with cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I mean by that is Dr. Sue Cicely,
who is studying PTSD with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: she's not permitted to study terpenes with
her research, and we all know that the
[SPEAKER_03]: D-lemonine is what causes PTSD patients to
have bad reactions, whereas linalool is
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of the opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much of your work is devoted to
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the cannabis plant contains a large
number of additional compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that are not cannabinoids,
like terpenes, flavonoids, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many years ago, we found that there is
something we call the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it entourage effect, meaning that
compounds that by themselves are not very
[SPEAKER_00]: active or not active at all change the
activity of other compounds, in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, this has been seen by many
people taking cannabinoids, saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, the total plant works much better
than just plain THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is an official drug in this country,
but not a particularly successful one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant is, and it seems to be that
there is a major thing going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's this entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, in addition to our own
paper quite a few years ago, there has
[SPEAKER_00]: been very little work done on the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it exists, but it has to be
much more investigated, and it has not
[SPEAKER_00]: been investigated, which is a pity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's one of those lacunas,
if you wish, that have to be looked into.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Valeria, and I wanted to
ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, thank you for a wonderful
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, I wanted to ask you to share
your ideas about the role of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and the transmission of the pain signals
in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I ask is that I went through
the literature and I found out that many
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers indicated that THC and
cannabinoids, they do not have profound
[SPEAKER_01]: effect on the severe pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have some effect on the local
pains, and I know that the recent studies
[SPEAKER_01]: performed in the United States by the
combination of CBD and THC in the cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: pain didn't produce any hopeful results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to hear what you think about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I believe you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that a mixture, in the case of
pain at least, of CBD and THC seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: better than THC alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we had more information of the
amounts of the types of pain, and not
[SPEAKER_00]: every pain, of course, is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids do not work on acute pain,
but they work on neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to know more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, chances are that it's better to have
both CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are that it's better to have THC
and maybe some of the other compounds than
[SPEAKER_00]: to rush compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the data in the literature is
unsignificant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have time for one more question,
and then
[SPEAKER_05]: you get a chance to meet him after we
break here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sir?
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, thanks for speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was mind-blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to say, I just wondered,
when you're talking about the CB1
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor...
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hear you well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're talking about the CB1 receptor
and how you had that whole program for how
[SPEAKER_02]: the synapses work, I was wondering,
what were the obstacles that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: facing with the CB2 receptor?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you were saying, we don't know a
lot about that one compared to the CB1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I didn't get what you asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the difference between studying
the CB1 receptor when you had the nerve
[SPEAKER_02]: synapse before compared to the CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there should be investigations in
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CB1 is acted upon by THC by both ends
of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CB2 is also acted on by THC and both
endocannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the activity is dispersed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the way we and many others
are going ahead by trying to have specific
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 agonists is very promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having the activity only in the CB2 and
this way eliminating any possible
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, there isn't a single drug
on the market which is CB2 specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I understood you well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
Thank you.
