[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for coming at 8.30 in the
morning to listen to some really,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we'll dive into some hazards
analysis later on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first of all, thank you to the
organizers of CanMed for inviting me and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving me this chance to talk about some
contaminants and how we approach
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my talk today is going to be about a
hazard space analysis for building and
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive analytical testing program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've spent most of my life in the
analytical world in the food industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've, for close to 30 years now,
been working with pesticides and other
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants or things that you don't want
in your food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or any product that you consume or you use
on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've often been called the pest
lady, because that's what I focus a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: on, pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember the names of pesticides at
times when I forget the names of my
[SPEAKER_00]: children.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much I work on pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so, and currently I am with,
I work with Eurofens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know if many of you familiar with
Eurofens, we're a global network of
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 800 laboratories across the
globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I promise that's the only pitch I have
for Eurofens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, like we said, we're going to be
talking about hazards analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the background for this, I kind of
borrowed it from my background in the food
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2011, the Food Safety Modernization
Act was signed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually when we talk about health and
safety, we focus on the microbial risks,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the effects are immediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And contaminants and chemical hazards are
usually forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are important for the safety and
quality of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2011, Food Safety Modernization
Act, FISMA, included contaminants,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically chemical hazards,
and added that requirement for the food
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they required a risk-based hazard
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that, the verification
of ingredients and suppliers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of specifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is usually a challenge when you have
a product and you have various ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: in a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know what you want in it,
but the challenge is sometimes what we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want in it that could affect the
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, the safety,
but also the value of your business,
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketing value of your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys remember a while back,
Dr. Oz and heavy metals in apple juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wanted us to label our apple juice
with a sign that this could be
[SPEAKER_00]: carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who would want to drink apple juice
that says this could potentially expose
[SPEAKER_00]: you to cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so borrowing that, the background for
this is the process that they required is
[SPEAKER_00]: you identify your hazards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You figure out how to control the hazards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You manage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you verify that your managing of your
hazards is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then usually if you have various
ingredients in your product, that your
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain is following all the controls
that you're wanting to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been working with people setting
up analytical quality monitoring programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, for close to 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the three, well,
there's really four.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three questions that I get asked more
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I test?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I test?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do I test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and by the way, I only have this
amount of money to spend for this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the risk-based hazard analysis also
helps you get the most value for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: budget you have for your testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we had the limited budget,
we could test every lot, every ingredient,
[SPEAKER_00]: every time we open a packet of supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we have, we could just test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could get very costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this, based on using the hazards
analysis, it enables you to rank your
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients or your products and
categorize them as low risk, medium risk,
[SPEAKER_00]: and high risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a limited budget,
you focus on your high risk, then a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit on the medium, and maybe alternate
some of the low risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, we do testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, we don't and all that good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or use our data and figure out where we
can mitigate risk without having to do
[SPEAKER_00]: actual testing and spending money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the chemical, I'm sorry
that my slides are kind of like off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look fine when I send them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the chemical risk assessment,
this is the chemical risk assessment
[SPEAKER_00]: process that we follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phase one, is the hazard
characterization and ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then determination of exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that step involves a lot of data
review, document review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the food world, one of my favorite
reading, puts me to sleep at night,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the FDA import alerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that tells you what's being held
and detained at the ports for illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: substances or for violative substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not getting allowed to enter
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a whole long list of them,
and it's quite interesting reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at this phase, you identify your
risk factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phase two, you classify them as you
rank your ingredients, whether they're
[SPEAKER_00]: high, medium, or low, and then you follow
up activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that involves all these
ingredients to your suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your verification or testing
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your suppliers are very key for
you to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: You being able to have a high quality and
safe product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so going back to cannabis slash hemp,
we can do the, we can apply this,
[SPEAKER_00]: borrow what we've done in the food
industry to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we start off with assessing sources
of contamination from ground to shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we start from soil all the way
to when we put the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shelf and look at every phase of
that and see what our potential exposure
[SPEAKER_00]: to hazards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the risk factors that is always
part of a hazard analysis is the inherent
[SPEAKER_00]: risk related to that product or
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we use that thinking is we ask
this three questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How likely is it to occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: How likely am I going to remove it from
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Processing and are there multiple hazards
occurring at one time?
[SPEAKER_00]: This three questions I cop, we copied as
we were creating this tool from the codex
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, but usually it's about how
likely is it to cause death?
[SPEAKER_00]: How likely are, and so, but we've applied
it here for, so the likelihood of
[SPEAKER_00]: occurrence of that chemical or that
contaminant or that hazard in that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular product or ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I process it, would I remove it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would I concentrate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when you're making apple
juice concentrate and you have heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals, let's say lead in your product,
in the apples themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you extract them and you make your
concentrate and they go with your,
[SPEAKER_00]: but your extraction process, they carry
over, you will in fact concentrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of lead in the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's soluble in the final juice
that you have, and sometimes lead does
[SPEAKER_00]: carry over, or a pesticide that's water
soluble that, for example, methamidophos,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is for a while a problem pesticide
in the food industry because it is water
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble and when you do use your
concentrate, it does concentrate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then multiple hazards occurring at one
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, vegetables or cannabis could
be exposed both to heavy metals and to
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to other stuff that it will pick up
from the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you have this series of
answers, so if it's likely to occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't remove it from processing and
multiple hazards occur at one time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a very high risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the inherent risk becomes three.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, we just categorize it from one,
low, medium, high, so one, two,
[SPEAKER_00]: and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if it's unlikely to occur,
and even though you can't remove it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not likely to be there,
anyway, and then there's no possibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple hazards occurring, then there's
very minimal, little or no risk to that
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's apply and borrow this for our
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, when we look at cannabis,
we're only looking at one material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with a plant, just a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to call it, it's considered a
rack, raw agricultural commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to consider it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go and we look at the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that previous graph I took you
from soil to shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with soil and then the plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know cannabis is a phytoremediator,
so it will absorb things that are on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the soil, usually the biggest
risks that you have are usually heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2019, I partnered with a company and we
did testing of about 300 soil samples and
[SPEAKER_00]: tested it for pesticides and for heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the other end, we tested the
product that came out from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested about 700 biomass samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found, this is actually a
poster we presented at AOAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're interested to look at those
numbers, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your, and I'll send you the
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did translate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, one pesticide,
chloranthranilipro, was in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: already because it was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it was applied during planting,
but it was there because of the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: crops that were used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came through to the final mass,
the final plant material, about 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we found some DDT in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, DDT did not translate to the
product, so it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are some of the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same trend with heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the heavy metals, it's very
difficult to predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no linear correlation from soil to
the actual plant material itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, because during the
plant growth, although we know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't usually apply pesticides as you're
growing your crop, but depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighboring crops that you have,
they may be applying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're allowed to apply pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an adverting drift that we
call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're spraying up in the air,
and the wind is just the right direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right strength, and the right speed,
it could land on your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, some of those, if they're just
surface, they could be removed by washing
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing extraction,
they will probably go through all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the risks that we've determined,
asking all those questions about inherent
[SPEAKER_00]: risk, is at this phase, heavy on heavy
metals and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fertilizers, some of them also fall
into the categories of the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do pesticides screening,
there are some fertilizers included in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, or fertilizer type structure
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we move on after you harvest it
and you store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the issues that we look into,
and this is how we, after we did inherent
[SPEAKER_00]: risk questions, asked asking them mold,
bacteria, and once again, pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the reason for pesticides during
harvest and storage is sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've encountered some of this where we had
a problem on some cranberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the supplier swore no pesticide was
used in that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't come in contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing was used as it was growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the crate that they used,
for storing their, and transporting their
[SPEAKER_00]: product, was sprayed with a wax that had
some pesticides in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those little cranberries absorbed the
little pesticides, and we saw them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to blame it in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, your results are wrong,
you're not correct, you're not doing your
[SPEAKER_00]: job correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even sometimes, another example is
coffee, which is you're, we're importing
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee and they're on the barges and all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they do clean those barges,
and they do spray cleaners on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and coffee likes to absorb when there's
the oily outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it adds to the flavor of the coffee,
I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, you could pick it up from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the mycotoxins, of course,
are directly related to the molds and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that it could be produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mycotoxins stay, and they are a
health hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we move on to processing,
and then manufacture, and then all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you take your plant material
and you extract it, so you expose it to
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mycotoxins are still there,
because sometimes they're being stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the mycotoxins have already formed
and they're there, there's a big chance
[SPEAKER_00]: that it will carry over to your extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to store them properly,
which is, I think, everybody's goal as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pesticides and heavy metals,
where they come in is when you add
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start to make your complex
products, or you add flavors, or you have
[SPEAKER_00]: some olive oil as a carrier, or I may be
using off-the-cuff examples here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the idea is that the more you have and
this is where another level of risk-based
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis is good to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you have ingredients and you
have exposure to pesticides and heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals, especially if you're importing
ingredients from outside of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States to add into your products,
the risk goes up because the regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: for pesticides or for contaminants is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's usually a different difference in
the different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the geography is a source of risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one example I always like to give is,
I worked a lot in apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in South America, I used to go to
South America every year to look at apple
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for pesticide, diphenoconazole is
allowed for use in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it carries over when they make the
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also dimethylate and dimethylate,
which has been revoked here in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it carries over to the concentrate,
totally allowed, perfectly good in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they go on the tanker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FDA gets a hold of them and tests
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, diphenoconazole, and like I said,
dimethylate, dimethylate's been revoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pesticides are perfectly legal in
Brazil, are now violent in the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes the product unusable here in
the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our differences in regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy metals is not as simple because the
US does not have regulations for heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have levels that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And FDA has a trend to zero for heavy
metals, especially with the recent baby
[SPEAKER_00]: food concern for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those two are a concern and adds
for your contaminant risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on all of this, we've come up
with the contaminant pro using the
[SPEAKER_00]: risk-based hazards analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is familiar to all of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a contaminant profile that's
really good to apply to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to test for all of them
in all phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, like for example, you don't need to
test your raw plant material for residual
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents because there would be no
exposure or risk of exposure for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use those questions than my four or
five slides before, you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine what phase you want to test
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually, though microbiology is
there in the profile, I won't speak to
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology because I may be giving you
incorrect information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will focus on my contaminants and my
pesticides as we do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've gone through the risk
hazard thought process and then we have
[SPEAKER_00]: our contaminant profile, this allows you
to take you to testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will take some of my time to talk
about testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not all testing is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And methods and procedures and all this is
important to be aware of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take you through some testing and
advances in testing for the contaminant
[SPEAKER_00]: profile for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will start with the residual
solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the exposure of your product is when
you do your extraction, this residual
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents are usually from the extraction
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most that we see usually is
ethanol, butane, propane, and methanol in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharma industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we get asked to do methanol as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then supercritical CO2, which usually
will not leave a residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the reason for the concern for
residual solvents is after you've
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted it and you think you're removing
all those solvents that you've used for
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, sometimes they don't all quite
go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: The list that I have there is the BCC list
of solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other regulations ask for the full
USB 467 list of solvents, which is about
[SPEAKER_00]: five times more components than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a compendial method for USB,
usually used in the pharma industry for a
[SPEAKER_00]: full length 467.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the kind of testing that
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And residual solvents is usually tested by
headspace, which makes sense because you
[SPEAKER_00]: want a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take your product and you add your
solvents to it and seal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you seal it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the lab, we make sure it's sealed
because you heat it a little bit so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you release some of those residual
solvents as they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all this are done closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have that big tea thing on
top is your autosampler, pretty fancy
[SPEAKER_00]: autosampler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more expensive than the GC system,
the autosampler, because your analysis is
[SPEAKER_00]: very dependent on that autosampler that it
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does what it does and delivers whatever
residual solvent to the instrument that
[SPEAKER_00]: measures it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at a quote last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GC was, I think, I don't know,
40k, they told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the autosampler was 80k.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, hmm, I may be able to hold
the GC, but the autosampler, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, you do need that set up though
to give you your precision and your RSDs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good autosampler is very important in
the residual solvent testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next one we go to is mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And though there are, as you can see
there, there's about 12, 16 mycotoxins
[SPEAKER_00]: that are commonly tested for.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cannabis world, most of the
regulations only focus on the five,
[SPEAKER_00]: the AFLAS and Okra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I work, we also work with infant
formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the limits of the cannabis
world, because they're significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than infant formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wouldn't say easy, but a little
bit simpler to get to than what we try to
[SPEAKER_00]: do for infant formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mycotoxins are a highly toxic natural
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're allergic to it,
it's not very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have, I don't know, a peanut,
a nut that's sometimes a little mold in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, some mycotoxin, and you eat it,
and your body doesn't like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have issues in your mouth after
taste, or you could actually get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every now and then, you could see it in
the food come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are not easy to destroy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't heat them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The molecule is very persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to test them, we do use a very simple
extraction and do LC-MS analysis for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the LC-MS allows us to get to the
action limits that most of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: state regulations offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go to heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, the heavy metals is the
testing involves a digestion with some
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, nitric acid usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you transfer it and send it off
to your ICP-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we do it ICP-MS or other detection
systems that you can do, although they are
[SPEAKER_00]: less sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we also do MS-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do tandem MS, because like I said,
in my lab, we also work with infant
[SPEAKER_00]: formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And infant formula, they want zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, which is not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go to one PPV.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want PPV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in cannabis, I think these are
limits of quants for the samples that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five, 10, lead, five, arsenic,
10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's total arsenic, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although for those of you in cannabis that
are concerned with Prop 6, Prop 65 looks
[SPEAKER_00]: for inorganic arsenic, which if your total
arsenic is below what the threshold is for
[SPEAKER_00]: inorganic arsenic for Prop 65,
then you can have a good safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel good that you are under that
inorganic arsenic threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cadmium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this limit of quants are actually well
below many of the state regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy metals analysis is not an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's good quality, and there's many
labs that can do it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very established system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you still need to have a good quality
control in your digestion and your blanks
[SPEAKER_00]: and controls to follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's generally tested using ICP-MS,
acid digestion and ICP-MS spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go to my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is, nowadays, is a very big
question in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cannabis world, in the hemp world,
because of many regulations, each state
[SPEAKER_00]: has different sets of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: What pesticides do you test?
[SPEAKER_00]: And which list are you going to go
through?
[SPEAKER_00]: What limit of quants do you want to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in Colorado, that is the
biggest challenge you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the limit of quants that Colorado
requires for the certification is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the compounds are low,
but you can get to it if you work hard
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a general background.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's transferred to hemp-based
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the risk, how it could get
into there, at the soil and during your
[SPEAKER_00]: planning and exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But currently, there are 1,600 parent
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's really over 6,000 registered
pesticides in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think there's a synthetic
pesticide that's registered for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some biological pesticides that
are registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the last time I checked, there was not
a synthetic pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's allowed for use in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means any pesticides you detect
could be considered violative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily, states, from state to state
to state to state, they have what they
[SPEAKER_00]: call action limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you try to fall well under the action
limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, Colorado is the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because their action limits or their
limits of quant requirement is quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then their list is also very
extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same with Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also an extensive list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people always ask me, do we really need
to test for pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really not a law that tells you
you have to test for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike micro, you're required to test for
micro and some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aflatoxin, there is a regulation that
tells you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason that you test for
pesticides is it's actually codified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it falls under the definition of
adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take your final product,
your cannabis, put it into food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's deemed adulterated and subject to
enforcement if it contains either a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide that's a level greater than the
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's no tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any pesticides greater than the level
of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that's what it is, a pesticide for
which there is no tolerance, exemption,
[SPEAKER_00]: or food additive regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is considered adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is not legal to distribute
adulterated food, at least in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, EU, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the shea, if you're in the
dietary supplement world, the shea tells
[SPEAKER_00]: you the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's adulterated, it's considered
misbranded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do not want misbranded products
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there really is a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's codified.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be concerned about pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least be aware of what your
pesticide profile is of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so no surprises for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, as I mentioned already,
there are many different sets of analyzed
[SPEAKER_00]: lists and then action limits specific to
individual states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Colorado has the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Florida is a close second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Washington, the state of Washington,
is not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also has a long list of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're similar, but sometimes two or
three compounds different enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily, you can screen for
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for here, the pesticide residue
analysis is the most complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of all the contaminants that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because unlike, for example, mycotoxins,
there were only five components we were
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In heavy metals, there were only four
components we were interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In residual solvents, maybe 12 to 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the most, maybe 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticide residues usually screen for
about 500 compounds to be comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are so many pesticides out
there to pick from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two approaches that we kind
of define the approaches to pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: residue testing as the classical approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with a classical approach 30
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you actually do liquid-liquid
chemical separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use a ton of methylene chloride,
acetone, put it in a safe funnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's those pictures of scientists that you
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we actually do chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This solvent chemistry to separate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then now they have the modern
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advent of technology of LCMS and GCMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the classical approach,
the reason for all those mixing with lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of amounts of acetone and methylene
chloride is to clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take your hamps, like green,
and those colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those compounds sometimes interfere
with analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you do a lot of the
extraction, methanol or acetone,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can shake them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can separate the organics from the
pesticides that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up with, if you did it your
job right, a colorless liquid at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because our instruments don't like those
highly colored stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they mess your instruments up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, because of concerns for the
environment, and we want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible, in the last 15, 20 years,
they did away with a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used only a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went from 100 mils to about 5 to 10
mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, for those of any of you guys
here in the pesticide world, the advent of
[SPEAKER_00]: LCMS and then catchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in our lab, what we like is,
dilution is the best manner of cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't use chemicals and all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way we're able to do that is
if you have a GCMS, or if you have the MS,
[SPEAKER_00]: or 10 MMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they call the modern
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is very, very dependent on the
instrument that you use at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the classical approach is
dependent, your ability to screen for
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, dependent on the first part.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how good you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how good you separate it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a multi-residue method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, there's 500 plus compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's labs in the EU that can do 700
compounds at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's mind boggling to look at the
data, the chromatography, that comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also optimized for analysis of
complex samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're doing pesticides,
it is really best, if you want to cover a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide range of components, to do two
platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: GCMS and LCMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often in the cannabis world, we see where
we tend to only use the LCMS platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you only use one platform,
it puts you at a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are compounds, pesticides,
that are not amenable to LC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the GC to get them out and have a
recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them, I see some head shaking
in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of them, really the recoveries,
they don't make it quite through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you have both of them,
when you're using both of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can immediately do a confirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see a positive, and if it also
comes out in the GC, you can look at what
[SPEAKER_00]: the GC transitions are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they match, then you have immediate
confirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a GC, and it also works in LC,
we have about 235 analytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think 90% of the lists that are in
the list for the states for the pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have, 90% of those do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fall into where they can be done by either
GC or LC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's just a few of them enough that
you have to use one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use GC.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them, and I'm pretty sure I'll have
people disagree with me, is bifentrine as
[SPEAKER_00]: an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bifentrine is one of those compounds
that show up in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's best on the GC-MS-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can survive with LC-MS-MS,
but your recoveries could be low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the accuracy is not quite there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because cannabis is such a complex
matrix, you do have to validate so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the analyte you want in the
presence of other components and the limit
[SPEAKER_00]: of quant that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can assess the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the terms that we need to
define when we validate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How selective the method is, what our
limit of quant, what the accuracy,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the precision, and the robustness is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The robustness that we do, we have a very,
because we also have to meet the SANTE
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement for the EU when we do our
validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over three days and two to three
analysts that we have to repeat the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process and look at the RSTs between our
analysts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And method validation takes quite a lot of
effort to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does, at the end, give you a
confidence in your method, that your
[SPEAKER_00]: method is doing what it's meant to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that what you're seeing is your
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not seeing any pesticides,
you're confident that there really is no
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide in there because you validated
the method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the validation, you define
criteria for acceptance of your analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for pesticides residue, we have to do,
this is just an example of what could go
[SPEAKER_00]: on in the lab because, like I said,
cannabis hemp is a difficult matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use the base as the catcher sample
preparation, which is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take your matrix, you add a little
nitrile, you add salt, and you shake them
[SPEAKER_00]: for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take them through a solid
phase extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have a clean extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the layer on the top,
you take it, you shoot it to your machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are different combinations that
you could use for cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just vary the salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you have, depending on the
structure of the pesticides you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: capture and what you want to focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes, to meet the Colorado
requirements, we've had to use at least
[SPEAKER_00]: three of those combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you often have to go back twice to meet
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we keep putting difficult sample
because it is a difficult matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the things how we get
away with false positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, actually, this is the cheesy part,
which is this is for matrix interference
[SPEAKER_00]: that we do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do a split purge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of really deep into the
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a technique that we use into
separating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do the purge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the bad stuff that we don't want
goes to the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good stuff that we want goes to
the guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, you need a guard column before your
column when you do chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't ruin your actual analytical
column.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the guard column is usually,
I don't know, maybe, just as an example,
[SPEAKER_00]: $50 in your analytical column could be
upwards of $500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a tennis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the guard column absorbs a lot of the
gunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just in case you want to set
up your own best side test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very simplified diagram of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a lot of experience that's in
the back of that when you're interpreting
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is the one you do besides
your MS, which is you have transitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I try to describe MS, for those of you
that are not really familiar with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is you have this little compound,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you send it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like having daughters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you take it further,
you have down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their fingerprints are very specific to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is when we do our LC or GC,
you have a compound in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has what you expect the transitions to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the ratio or something is not right
based on the criteria that we've set,
[SPEAKER_00]: it triggers another transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you end up at the end with more
transitions to confirm your compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is simplified here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the standard below and then the
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, second, and third squares,
they all kind of look the same until you
[SPEAKER_00]: go to that final step, where the
fingerprint, I call them fingerprint,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't match anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take them further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am not an expert in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have quite a few experts in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just understand the surface of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any questions about it,
send it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will send it to the proper people to
answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of all of that,
to give confidence to your testing or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a lab or in-house lab or you're
looking at other labs, there's always the
[SPEAKER_00]: accreditation that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the accreditation, if you can read
that, it just demonstrates the competence
[SPEAKER_00]: of labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically standardizes labs for the
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a systematic approach to
documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the only thing that's important
to remember is that the accreditation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ISO accreditation, is there's a
general accreditation that you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: for a site, but more importantly,
the methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are method specific, the ISO
accreditation, and often can go down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the matrix that you have for your
accreditation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an added layer of confidence
that you have, that there's a consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: in the practices of the lab and the
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have an in-house lab,
if you want to have your own, it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to help you be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went through the risk base and
that's important to understand what your
[SPEAKER_00]: potential hazards are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is important that you test your raw
materials or at least know the baseline of
[SPEAKER_00]: your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the budget doesn't allow for every lot
or everything, at least get the baseline
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand when it's related to your
suppliers, where you're sourcing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to test them every day or
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have an understanding of your
baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because of the complexity of the
hemp matrix and the hemp extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the isolates that we get from them,
we need to sometimes go look for
[SPEAKER_00]: technology to help us into figuring out
those contaminants, knowing what the
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants are in our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really important to use validated
methods or the term fit for purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know that what you have is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the ISO accreditation adds
another level of confidence for STEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have a little bit of time
for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed your presentation, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love to get a copy of that study that you
mentioned at the beginning of your talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a poster, AOC poster, and I can
send you a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I publish a lot in the field of heavy
metals and cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's compelling evidence
out there that we need to be expanding the
[SPEAKER_01]: elemental panel beyond the big four.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information in the public
domain, how the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_01]: approached that, using a risk assessment
strategy, which to me is guidance to the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, but it's convincing the industry
that they should think about expanding the
[SPEAKER_01]: elemental panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can publish and I can talk about it
in your conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a talk this afternoon at 3 o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd just like to get your thoughts and
input, how we can convince the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that they need to be expanding
that elemental panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To date, actually, if we go through to
follow the pharma industry, we are
[SPEAKER_00]: currently doing a validation study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has 17 elements in it included.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for the release of their product,
which is the trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going from four, I do agree with you
that there are some elements that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to add to the four.
[SPEAKER_00]: But currently, though, the regulations
only ask for the four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be once state-to-state
regulations move to adding more elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we would definitely have to take a
look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, the heavy metal methods are
easily extended to include more elements
[SPEAKER_00]: in the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a big jump to go from four to
a few more compounds, except for maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: selenium and molybdenum and some of that,
which you may need a different mode of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe your talk is at 3 PM this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested to hear,
learn more about heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 PM this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the next part is coffee
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we should go and get our coffee
break early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
