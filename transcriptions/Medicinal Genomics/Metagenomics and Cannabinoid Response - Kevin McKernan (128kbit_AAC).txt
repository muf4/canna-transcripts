[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to speak about metagenomics
and cannabinoid response, and it's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: reach right now, but hopefully by the end
of this, I'll convince you that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over a decade ago, we started
sequencing the human genome across the
[SPEAKER_00]: river.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few people in this room were involved in
building a robotic field to basically
[SPEAKER_00]: construct two football fields worth of
robotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in East Cambridge because the real
estate was cheap, and that's an important
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that took us several years to build
the robots, but in 10 months, those robots
[SPEAKER_00]: finished sequencing 40 million E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli clones, and we spent painstaking
efforts to make sure there wasn't any
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial contamination in the human
genome reference, and that was important
[SPEAKER_00]: so that after the human genome was
complete, we could then study the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of microbiomes on human health,
and we needed a human reference to screen
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everyone's probably familiar with
the mice transplantation experiments,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can actually transplant obesity
from one mice to its twin by moving the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very clear that this has a
profound impact on human health,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we need to understand these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more microbial genes on your
body than your own, but they're different
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a lot of exon intron
splicing going on, so they arguably don't
[SPEAKER_00]: produce as many proteins, but there's
still nevertheless more cells that are
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial on your body than human.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to pay attention to the
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, fast forward to 2000, oh,
I think I've missed a particular slide
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but if you fast forward to actually
2010 to look at cannabis genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna step in here and see if I
can resurrect that, you will see something
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't look as if it is that modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if this surgery will prevail
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, what we see today, if you saw
the picture behind this, it was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: two people in a hotel room purifying DNA
in Holland, because in 2010, we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: need a football field full of robotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could actually purify DNA from a
species in a hotel room and get to its
[SPEAKER_00]: genome just by moving that DNA to a
sequencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in the process of doing that,
a few years later, we've been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually throw some of these robotics out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the problem, and Ryan Lynch is
going to be showing where these robotics
[SPEAKER_00]: actually lead to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got it going right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you saw the tour yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this thing is basically running around
sequencing dozens of cannabis genomes to
[SPEAKER_00]: get us a better phylogenetic tree,
and there's a good reason for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of this effort is actually to
drive it and understand the genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: drive cannabinoid expression and terpene
expression and perhaps a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, perhaps flowering rates and oil
and how quickly these plants might grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can perhaps tag those things to
genetic variants and track them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're particularly excited about the
changes that have happened since 2000,
[SPEAKER_00]: even the year 2000 when the human genome
closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis genome is not nearly in as
good shape as the human genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the human genome probably down to
only 100 gaps right now, and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genome is far harder to sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the hardest genome we've
ever sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a billion bases in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 65% AT, which is a nightmare to
sequence just from a chemistry standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, it differs by about
one in a hundred bases, whereas humans
[SPEAKER_00]: differ about one in a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the equivalent of having chimps
being able to mate with humans and still
[SPEAKER_00]: have productive offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a real challenge to sequence
and only recently have new sequencing
[SPEAKER_00]: tools emerged to help us on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing we did learn from the first
time we sequenced this genome was that the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC synthase region of the genome was at
8x higher coverage than the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stood out to us as perhaps being a
gene replication event that was
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for secondary metabolite
expression and maybe was also responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for bringing us more THC synthase
throughout the selection and prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, we actually couldn't
properly sequence this because we only had
[SPEAKER_00]: 700 base pair reads and the gene was about
1600 bases long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we needed to know the perfect phase of
this gene, which meant we needed to know
[SPEAKER_00]: which variants were resting on the
maternal chromosome and which were on the
[SPEAKER_00]: paternal chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two copies of every chromosome in
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know that and the gene
happens to have lots of variation in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be very difficult to call the amino
acid sequence that's resulting from these
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew there was gene expansions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know what they coded for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was naturally a question,
did these other genes code for these other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we really only see two genes in
the genome that can code for cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD synthase and THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast forward to today and we now have
these single molecule sequencers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can luckily sequence 40,000 bases at
a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge is they only have 85 percent
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get the accuracy to a place where we
want it to be, we can play some tricks
[SPEAKER_00]: with 40,000 base pair read lengths as we
can actually clone this DNA with some
[SPEAKER_00]: hairpins, and they call them smart bells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this thing can then run around like a
hamster on a wheel and sequence this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: around and around and around like a circle
and give us an error corrected sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call a circular consensus
sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does this with these zero mode
waveguides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those of you who are familiar with
microwaves, you may see a screen in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of that microwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is to basically make sure the
radiation, which has a larger wavelength
[SPEAKER_00]: than the diameter of the hole of that
screen, doesn't emanate through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it does do is it leaves a little
finite, zeptalite volume of a radiation of
[SPEAKER_00]: that wavelength at a pinpoint in the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pinpoint is so small that a
single polymerase can fit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can watch that single polymerase
incorporate DNA signals in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just due to the nature of loading
these things, about a third of them only
[SPEAKER_00]: get loaded with a polymerase that can
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, there's millions of these
holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can read basically the THC synthase
sequence of dozens of cultivars at a go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as we run it around 20 or so
times, we get the accuracy up to a point
[SPEAKER_00]: where it is acceptable to understand the
amino acid sequence of all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we've done this on a many drug
type cultivars, what we find is there's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a lot of copies of THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we know the amino acid sequence of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can determine which ones are active
and inactive and which ones are still
[SPEAKER_00]: question marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of inactive copies that
are getting replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have frame shift mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they probably don't code for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of other ones that have
single amino acid changes that might have
[SPEAKER_00]: a different efficiency of folding the
precursors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they may actually have other side
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might result in these other
cannabinoids folks have seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lo and behold, we still only see two
major synthase-like compounds in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: their relatives, which we could argue
maybe can account for about 10 of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and their derivatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't explain where all the other
ones are coming from with just this alone,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless the side product thing is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other literature that's out there
are that microbiomes potentially transform
[SPEAKER_00]: these things by hydroxylating different
parts of the side chain and maybe even Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: McChulham was recommending that they might
hydroxylate some parts of the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: precursors that would change the way that
these things fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Albeit most of these papers suggest it's
at very, very low rates and yields that
[SPEAKER_00]: this occurs and that they can't get enough
of the material to do any type of clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: study with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, this is very different than
what we see in the terpene synthase
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene synthase pathway in plants
looks a lot like a plant or vertebrate
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has lots of introns and exons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get all types of alternate
splicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's perhaps this alternate splicing
that might, in fact, be governing the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that we see in terpene in
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do THC synthase come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a berberine bridge domain in this
gene that we see in poppy, which folds
[SPEAKER_00]: opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see it up and down the
angiosperm line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's some very weak homology to
bacteria and fungi as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of looks like a microbial
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a start and a stop, and it's a
single exon, which is very interesting to
[SPEAKER_00]: us considering some of the work that Dr.
Machulam's published on quorum sensing
[SPEAKER_00]: with these compounds and that they,
in fact, might be antimicrobial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these compounds look as if they are
communication vehicles to the microbiome
[SPEAKER_00]: that might sit on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be very important to us
when we're trying to understand this level
[SPEAKER_00]: of complexity of terpene expression that
can occur with these multi-exon genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can understand a few genes
could do this if they had all types of
[SPEAKER_00]: alternate splicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harder for us to imagine 100
cannabinoids coming from just two genes
[SPEAKER_00]: with the diversity that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe that's what's, in fact,
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to know the microbiome,
then, of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we set out to do is design a test that
could be used in many of the states that
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing mold testing and bacteria
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're mandating mold and bacteria testing
in almost every state that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized in.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the techniques that we're using
to measure this stuff do not really
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what bugs they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just count colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about 100-year-old technology
known as a petri dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, culture is a very interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting things to culture has maybe only
70% or less of the microbes are cultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some argue it's maybe even lower than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, it's not very
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon sources don't give you the type of
information that DNA does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we designed a test that actually
operates off of the ITS region of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the genomes that puts
you on the tree of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're highly conserved regions in the
ribosomal DNA operons that you can land
[SPEAKER_00]: primers on to specifically amplify one of
these genre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing so, there's information
inside of here that, if you were to
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence it, would give you high
specificity in exactly what genre and
[SPEAKER_00]: species you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we designed PCR assays that target this
region and give us quantitative
[SPEAKER_00]: information as to how much microbial
content is present on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we have that, if there's any
questions of one that happens to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: high in signal, we can then go in and
inquire what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that by sequencing these PCR
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives us a little microbiome idea
of what's going on in these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have a nice picture of all the
bugs that might be on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can go through and itemize them and
ask, OK, we see some aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some fusarium and some botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's one Girl Scout cookie that has
a tremendous diversity and a long tail of
[SPEAKER_00]: different microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these ones are a little bit older
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they seem to be dominated by just a
couple of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them stood out, however,
because these ones we were not finding on
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone's radar in terms of being a problem
in health care or on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are penicillium species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't grow very well in
traditional contexts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need different temperatures and
longer time for these things to emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lo and behold, when we look at these
microbes and we try to grow them,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a very difficult time growing them
in just a couple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are 3M Petri films that didn't grow
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are BioLumix cartridges that didn't
grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are yeast and mold things from
SimPlate that didn't grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can readily see the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This naturally evokes questions whether
the bugs are alive or dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to go and confirm that we could,
in fact, grow these in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if you ran the sequencing before
and after, you could actually see a shift
[SPEAKER_00]: in how these things were growing over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they happen to produce these
interesting compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whenever you do ITA sequencing,
it's standard to go back and confirm that
[SPEAKER_00]: with a secondary assay that it's really
species specific and you've got the bug
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we targeted the Paxilene gene that
actually makes the Paxilene and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Citrinum gene that makes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole genome sequenced those genes after
we amplified them and proved that they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we don't know is how much
they're expressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an important point is these all look
very lipophilic and they would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: co-extract with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also happen to be, this one in
particular, is a nanomolar drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a small percentage contaminant of this
can actually have a bigger impact than CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: alone because it's a potassium channel
blocker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been published to have
contraindications with CBD in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another one here, Citrinum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one actually is known for disease
called rye grass daggers on farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some cattle can eat rye and have some
of this penicillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll stagger around with some type
of ataxia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is more of a nephrotoxic agent
that's actually involved in a pathway that
[SPEAKER_00]: we know about from Roger Pertwee's lab and
Duncan Ryan's paper suggesting CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: actually targets this region in the VDAC1
receptor in the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Citrinum seems to be playing some role
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know what role it is,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this set us on a mission with Digipath
to try to see if we could detect whether
[SPEAKER_00]: the compounds are actually there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing to show the genes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to show that it's actually
expressing the compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very difficult in the cannabis
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started with Paxilin from Sigma and
started spiking that into cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: matrixes to see if we can pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first sight, what we can see is
that we lose about five to 10-fold signal
[SPEAKER_00]: in trying to detect this if we use the
ULIG method that was described using an
[SPEAKER_00]: LC-MS-MS spectrum of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we spike this in, we lose about five
to 10x signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still working on how to do this
with the samples that we detected in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: slides prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we now have an assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Sydney's group that can detect
this, we just have to make sure we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the sensitivity to pick up stuff that
might be nanomolar in concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to summarize some of this
microbiome work, what we have here is
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen that the culture-based systems
are basically screening things on any
[SPEAKER_00]: number of colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not a very accurate system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're quite concerned about this
because we don't know what microbes are,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we mentioned before, 99% of the
microbes in your body are commensal,
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic, and harmless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't want to screen those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need to get specific about the
ones that are a problem and target the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that are actually human health risk
and not just start screening out microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our fear in screening out microbes the
plant might need is very analogous to if
[SPEAKER_00]: you had to live on antibiotics,
you might screen out microbiomes that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may create an enormous genetic
selection against certain genetics in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that can't make it through this very
grotesque screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we want to do is dial in and get
much more specific with the DNA and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully fail less material and only
point out the ones that have health risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we've seen to date is we can
already tell that most of the yeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: mold assays out there, when we see
colonies on them, we grab those,
[SPEAKER_00]: we sequence them, and what we tend to find
are bacterias, bacteria that are native to
[SPEAKER_00]: humans and are not harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see staph.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see acne, propion bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are some pseudomonas we need to
worry about, originosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen that on occasion on some
cannabis samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, it's a ubiquitous form of
pseudomonas that's not a concern,
[SPEAKER_00]: likewise with the acne samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to be aware of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flip side of this coin is that a lot
of bugs do not culture at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had samples that are totally
loaded with mold that you can see with
[SPEAKER_00]: your own eyes, and they don't grow at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA certainly picks these things right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this was published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to some people in the audience,
John McPartlin really deserves to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: author on this paper because he gave us
such an incredibly constructive review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like this mechanism of
publication because of that, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: reviewers really actually do strengthen
the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a paper where you can review a
lot of this work and see what we did to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare this to a variety of different
culture systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to flip this over to human
genetics, which is 5.5% of the human
[SPEAKER_00]: population are going to develop a genetic
disease at some time in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could go as high as 60% over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to understand those
genetics because if we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: applying cannabinoids and perhaps some
mitochondrial transformed cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: onto humans, we want to understand the
genetic diversity in the patients that
[SPEAKER_00]: this might apply to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in doing this, we primarily have been
focusing on mitochondrial dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have some inroads into the ECS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason this is a very productive
place to start sequencing in the human
[SPEAKER_00]: genome is that most of health care is very
skeuomorphic, in that it is designed
[SPEAKER_00]: according to anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have cardiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have nephrology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have neurology.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all organ systems that we've
built health care silos around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're dealing with a dysfunction
in the Krebs cycle, it is very agnostic to
[SPEAKER_00]: which organ it is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can bounce between any of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that creates an enormous expense in
the health care system that likes to
[SPEAKER_00]: specialize based on organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So patients that have this type of
dysfunction can sometimes take 60 years to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a diagnosis and an enormous number of
bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this leads into seizures
because your brain is 2% of your body
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, but 20% of your energy
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a mitochondrial
dysfunction, it actually can find its way
[SPEAKER_00]: into pain, into GI issues, into seizure
disorders, and into ASD and developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've developed a lot of these panels
to target these different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be spoken on a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the really exciting work that
we're seeing, and this is published by
[SPEAKER_00]: Bernard a few years ago, is that we are
seeing a lot of CB1 localization to the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria in neural cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 15% of the CB1 receptors sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely connections,
and there's something going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why do we want to know this genetic
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know this genetic information
because we're finding a continuing growing
[SPEAKER_00]: list of genetic contraindications or
indications for particular genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sodium channel 1 mutation is
probably the most well-known in this
[SPEAKER_00]: audience because this is one that
signifies Dravet syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although people in the past used to
avoid sodium channel blockers,
[SPEAKER_00]: this might be a signature to actually move
on or go directly to Epidiolex or CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: because these patients are responding the
best in those studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have glucose transporter variants
that are indicative of a 90% response rate
[SPEAKER_00]: with a ketogenic diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have that variance, you might as
well go right to a diet change,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that may help with the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these polymerase gamma variants
that you want to avoid with vulprog acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have this variant in your given
depakote, you can destroy your liver,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you end up with a $500,000 liver
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important thing to find
out, and you want to know about it before
[SPEAKER_00]: you jump onto depakote.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other indications with GABA
receptors and stereopental and calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: channels changing this, but I think the
one that probably resonates the most you
[SPEAKER_00]: may hear later is that there's a vitamin
B6 form of epilepsy, that if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation in this gene, you can treat the
patient with vitamin B6, and you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: very good response rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a form of epilepsy that if you
treated it with CBD, you might actually
[SPEAKER_00]: just mask the problem for six months and
honeymoon out of it and realize you should
[SPEAKER_00]: have had B6 six months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one that's on our radar quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you went on the tour yesterday,
won't spend much time on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically have been sequencing panels
and exomes, predominantly panels first in
[SPEAKER_00]: pediatrics just due to the fact that when
you sequence whole exomes, you can uncover
[SPEAKER_00]: a great deal of information about people
that never consent to being sequenced,
[SPEAKER_00]: in other words, their relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you find APOE variants or BRCA
variants in these pediatric patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: that implies some other family members may
have some risk as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ACMG prefers that you dial this
into panels first and expand to exomes
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most important part of the
technique that we're running up there
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the analysis that goes on is in
the laboratory, it's a very condensed
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory because every patient that we
sequence, we hydroxymethylate their DNA in
[SPEAKER_00]: the act of amplification so that DNA is
ephemeral and gets just self-destroyed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the process of sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's needed so that we never
contaminate someone else's DNA with
[SPEAKER_00]: another and it makes the lab footprint
half the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been published in Nature
Biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some implications for gene patents
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, the progression we
tend to start with is maybe 500 to 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that we'll sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to dial this into just the genes
that are in the literature that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: are connected to the particular phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't find anything there,
there's a possibility of expanding to
[SPEAKER_00]: exomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between panels and
exomes is just the size of the box that
[SPEAKER_00]: you order these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things put out 250 gig in a shot,
and these do about 10 gig in a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, inside this panel, there happens to
be 39 different genes that we know are
[SPEAKER_00]: tied into the ECS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have many of the sodium channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the VDEC1 receptor in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see CNR1, CNR2, pho, magl,
dagl, mTOR, and a lot of these other ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the P450s that are of
importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think the list is probably about 175
long, but we're not sequencing those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the genes right now,
because it's tough to find any clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation with a variant in those genes
to an actual human patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in time, that will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do this, I want to touch just
briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the P450 system here, it is well known
now that CBD is effectively like a
[SPEAKER_00]: grapefruit juice warning on a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and
2C19, which means if you have drugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: have grapefruit juice warnings on them,
grapefruit juice has bergamot in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that actually goes through CYP3A4.
[SPEAKER_00]: CYP3A4 inhibits it.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD will slow down the metabolism of other
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clobizam or ONFY is one that was seen in
the Epidiolex trial, that this can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually escalate that in the blood,
and this is a prodrug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you change the metabolism of
prodrug, you're slowing down the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion of the drug into the active
form, and it can lead to some
[SPEAKER_00]: complications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same is true with carbamazepine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these drugs, I would caution just
to make sure that you have your HLA-1502
[SPEAKER_00]: variant sequence, because they're both
known to actually trigger Stevens-Johnson
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome, which can have 30 percent
mortality rate if you're not careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very frequent in our population,
very frequent in Asian and in the PACRM
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So P450s are important, because to know
this helps you understand how all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs are going to bounce around with one
another, and most patients with epilepsy
[SPEAKER_00]: are on three drugs, if not more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we provide these tables
of drug-drug interactions, that if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: on CBD, what of the other drugs are going
to go up and down in the blood according
[SPEAKER_00]: to the known literature, and, of course,
which variants are involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism of these, whether they're fast
metabolizers or slow metabolizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this may help guide treatment
optimization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we also sequence the entire
gene, and that's important, not just
[SPEAKER_00]: nailing these SNPs, but when you sequence
the entire gene, you might find frameshift
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations in that gene that are going to
basically reverse the, if this is a fast
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolizer, genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a fast metabolizer if there's
actually a frameshift next to these SNPs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that can be important information
to capture with whole-genome sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do see that stuff on the panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm just going to wrap up with
what you can do when you get to a pace of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing about 1,000 patients a month,
like we're doing up in Wilburn,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that serendipity will have it,
that you'll sequence some patients that
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually in current clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we tried to organize this a little
bit better than serendipity, and we called
[SPEAKER_00]: up Orin Dawinsky, and we called up Eric
Marsh and a few others, and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, can we sequence the patients in your
study, hopefully to get to a common
[SPEAKER_00]: polymorphism that might predict response?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been great success with Epidiolex
out there, but there is a small subset of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients that get worse, and when they get
worse in epilepsy, they can be intubated,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can end up in the ER, you can end up
with status epilepticus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very expensive, and so we want
to see if we can dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have found to date is only 55
patients have been sequenced to date,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with those 55 patients, we're starting
to see some signals, although I will
[SPEAKER_00]: caution you, and David Goldstein would
chime in here saying anything to 10 to the
[SPEAKER_00]: minus 4th could be a synthetic
association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need more patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, the SNPs that are coming
out of this are implicating a handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that may have a predictive value on
the response to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's interesting is the ones in
yellow up here have some published links
[SPEAKER_00]: to anandamide, and that is actually
enriched next to everything else that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the panel, that the genes that are falling
in as the top values here actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: published links.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very interesting, but we need to
do more, and we just started on this doing
[SPEAKER_00]: more with MGH.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an IRB study approved to sequence
55 more patients, and MGH, interestingly,
[SPEAKER_00]: at Elizabeth Thiel and David Friedman down
at NYU, has been doing some work showing
[SPEAKER_00]: this N-desmethylclobazam escalation with
CBD is real and traceable in the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't yet know if it's correlated with
those genotypes, and that's what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get at by sequencing these other
55 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another 50 patients that
we're bringing in from an IRB from
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Alabama, Birmingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe some of them are here in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have an IRB that's also grant
approved now from CHOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just received another grant to
sequence 50 more patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, we'll have another 155
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, that will be enough patients to
decide whether this is real or synthetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we may have a marker that can help
predict cannabinoid response and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: teach us a little bit about what's going
on with the esoteric nature of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to do this correctly, you need a team
of genetic counselors, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something on the X chromosome about
genetic counselors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to require a bigger study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without these people, we would never
get any of this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tremendous team up there that has a
real interest in personalized medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of external people as
well that have been helping us on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: including internal people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have some callouts to Digipath
and Cindy Orsner.
[SPEAKER_00]: She developed that LC-MS-MS technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's going to be some
presentations a little bit later from Ryan
[SPEAKER_00]: Lynch talking about the work we're doing
with the list exchange and genotyping a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these plants to get a better
understanding of the drift in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, I want to call out Doug
Smith, who's been doing a lot of the work
[SPEAKER_00]: on the GW study with Oren, Eric Marsh,
and Russell Senato, Peter Doherty with
[SPEAKER_00]: Roberto, who's been doing work on getting
this to the market, Jessica, Yvonne,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Wendell and Leigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all here doing work on various
aspects of exome sequencing and microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christina and Adrienne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adrienne did a lot of work on CBD synthase
and single molecule sequencing with us
[SPEAKER_00]: over the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christina's been helping on exomes as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, John, and Vichist as well have all
chipped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And likewise, some of our friends at SC
Labs have helped us getting very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting genetics to sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I will leave it for
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have time for just a couple questions,
and then we'll break for coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we could take a couple questions
for Kevin, if there are any, please just
[SPEAKER_01]: go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will be available at the coffee break
as well to answer any questions you might
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sir, over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great presentation,
Kevin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you speak into the mic a little bit
more?
[SPEAKER_02]: I will speak into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Michael.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the interaction of the microbiome
and its potential pathogenic nature in
[SPEAKER_02]: some cases, do you anticipate remediation
or sculpting or remodeling of a microbiome
[SPEAKER_02]: for a particular cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's early days, and we're hoping it may
help in just perhaps biomonitoring in
[SPEAKER_00]: growth rooms and to understand if anyone
has particular infections or blights,
[SPEAKER_00]: that this will be a helpful tool just to
understand that domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is definitely literature on using
bacillus to knock out botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bacillus is harmless, and that's
interesting to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's an important point,
because when you look at food,
[SPEAKER_00]: we take these tests and we go into the
supermarket and start testing cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you get a lot of CFUs from cheese,
but it's not harmful to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically one big ball of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we have to be rethinking
the colony forming system, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not giving us information with any
specificity about what to do if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: high CFUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's still early as to doing
what you suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hopeful we can figure that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fred Vogelstein at Wired.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's it cost to have your genetic test?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genetic testing costs can vary
depending on whether you're just doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial sequencing up into whole exome
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say the gamut can spread from
some tests that are $500 up to $15,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how many genes you're
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are insurance reimbursed,
usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, there's some limits on
how much you can ever get back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient due to out-of-pocket expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
