[SPEAKER_02]: Just search for CanMed events.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, enough with the shameless
self-promotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about our guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leilania Debois and Daniel Hendricks are
longtime Humboldt County residents who are
[SPEAKER_02]: working to preserve the unique culture and
cannabis genetics that have developed in
[SPEAKER_02]: the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along with other collaborators,
they have created the Humboldt Grace
[SPEAKER_02]: Legacy Project for the purpose of working
to protect, authenticate, and validate
[SPEAKER_02]: legacy cannabis genetics through
collaborative design.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leilei is the founder and board chair of
Humboldt Grace, whose mission is to
[SPEAKER_02]: empower the community in rural Northwest
California through education, events,
[SPEAKER_02]: and projects that promote and share the
culture of the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leilei grew up in two worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was with her father on the Southern
California beaches, while the other was
[SPEAKER_02]: with her mother in a home dead deep in the
heart of the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was with her mother where Leilei
experienced much of the trauma associated
[SPEAKER_02]: with the drug war, including raids,
family homelessness, death, kidnapping,
[SPEAKER_02]: and abuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: That experience was enough to make her
want nothing to do with cannabis as an
[SPEAKER_02]: adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that all changed in 1999 when Leilei
sustained a life changing spinal cord
[SPEAKER_02]: injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leilei began to implement the alternative
healing tools her mother taught her after
[SPEAKER_02]: Western medicines failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: She now believes the cannabis plant is a
large part of her ability to thrive and
[SPEAKER_02]: sees it as a vehicle to help create
positive change in her community that has
[SPEAKER_02]: been oppressed by the drug war.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel is the CEO and co-founder of
Hendrix Farms, which holds an annual
[SPEAKER_02]: California cannabis nursery license,
providing compliant, clean cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics to the licensed cannabis
producers in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel's journey and passion for cannabis
began at an early age in 1999 in his
[SPEAKER_02]: hometown of Arcata, Humboldt County,
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Affirmed by the scientific process,
community relationships, and sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: practices, these opportunities have
flourished.
[SPEAKER_02]: With his own special focus on genetics and
breeding, this unique plant aided in his
[SPEAKER_02]: personal growth and mental health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leilei, Daniel, and I discussed Humboldt
County's unique culture, the Humboldt
[SPEAKER_02]: residents experience with the drug war and
feelings towards cannabis legalization,
[SPEAKER_02]: the valuable cannabis specific knowledge
that legacy growers have and why they need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be connected with cannabis researchers
and academics to move the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: forward, and the legacy projects mission
to preserve Humboldt County's unique
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis genetics and create greater
access to the market for legacy growers
[SPEAKER_02]: through auction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation,
with Leilei and Daniel, I'd like to thank
[SPEAKER_02]: this episode's sponsor, Hendrix Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rooted in Humboldt County, Hendrix Farm is
a craft cannabis nursery that specializes
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis breeding, phenotype discovery,
and nursery production of elite cloned
[SPEAKER_02]: plant starts, seeds, and seed starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recognized for premium quality,
scientific process, and community ethics,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hendrix clones can be reserved by
businesses and home growers via special
[SPEAKER_02]: request at Hendrix.farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's H-E-N-D-R-X dot F-A-R-M.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Leilei
[SPEAKER_02]: DuBois and Daniel Hendrix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Leilei and Daniel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you guys are both proud
Humboldt County residents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think most people in the industry
are familiar with Humboldt or the Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: Triangle or have at least heard of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those listeners who are not
familiar with Humboldt County,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you could start by
telling us what makes that area so unique
[SPEAKER_02]: and so iconic in the greater cannabis
community?
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe Leilei, you can start.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think, you know, you kind of have
two people that grew up here in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my perspective, and I imagine
Daniel will agree with some of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's really more about our culture than
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The culture is what brought the plant here
and we utilize the plant to support our
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I think really makes us unique is
that we did build a culture kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: different than the rest of the world in a
lot of ways that evolve around
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability and engaging with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was taught to eat with the
seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew all our own food except for grains
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was raised off the grid with we built
our own solar power systems, our own
[SPEAKER_01]: energy systems, water heater systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really was to bring the world back
to nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people call it the back to
the land movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear the word the off-gridders these
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these communities and other
communities like it across the world
[SPEAKER_01]: really utilize cannabis to build that
utopian lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that's what sets Humboldt
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've managed to stand up against major
timber companies and change policy around
[SPEAKER_01]: logging.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've managed to protect our folks from
war in one of our towns.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made it so that if you were running
away from the, what is it called Daniel,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're enlisting, that you would be
protected in the city of Arcata.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really were able to take our views
of freedom and build them here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very engaged with our government,
which I really appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's that kind of back to the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we build a better world that
created the culture here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that my answer would reflect
the exact same principles where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental, you know, land stewardship
is at the core principle, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that hunting and fishing and farming are
all like a core part of everyone's
[SPEAKER_03]: operational function, that organics and,
you know, acceptance of race, religion,
[SPEAKER_03]: sexual orientation are all principles that
are like baked into the Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, persona, you know, and it ties
to like the kookiness and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: easiness of, hey, we accept the plant,
you know, we have, except nature,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have, you know, people like Julia
Butterfly in the nineties living in a
[SPEAKER_03]: Redwood tree, hundreds of feet,
you know, above the ground through all the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to show how much she and the
community care about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just, yeah, it's this weird
tapestry of like cannabis and openness and
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, artistic expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, the culture is what brings the
plant and the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you ask almost any dinner party,
have you ever been to Humboldt County,
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody there has passed through and
experienced some of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's the tourism, you know,
they're here for education at Humboldt
[SPEAKER_03]: State University or actually just wanted
to see this mythological place for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is mythological.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what year or when it was,
but when Mount Lassen last exploded and it
[SPEAKER_01]: hit the ocean, it created all these plates
that created all these really heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral deposits that have a lot of energy
coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at, it's called the
Klamath Knot is what is it's mystical
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it impacts the water, the environment
and all sorts of things around here that
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute to our biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very magical, geological
anonymity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that right, but you know the
word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going back to cannabis specifically,
though, and you can correct me if I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong, but sort of before before there was
really a legal market in California,
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt County and the Emerald Triangle
was really sort of the epicenter for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis culture in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think where we got in our history was
during during the 80s when camp came in
[SPEAKER_01]: and where we have a unique experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of cultures that
utilize cannabis in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways throughout history as we're slowly
unfolding.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I think is a little unique to
Humboldt and the Emerald Triangle is how
[SPEAKER_01]: our culture, how we were impacted and how
we navigated the drug war.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we really did have military
helicopters chasing us out of our gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that creates a lot of trauma,
but it also creates a lot of resilience,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what I love so much about our
communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's so valuable for the rest
of the world to understand and learn is
[SPEAKER_01]: how we do build resilience out of
hardship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, Humboldt County has
definitely it bears the scars of the drug
[SPEAKER_02]: war for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I don't want to speak for you
guys, but I think when, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization came through, there was a lot
of hope that, you know, the farms and the
[SPEAKER_02]: folks in Humboldt could could prosper from
that and really take advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I'm curious, you know,
if you could talk about what is the
[SPEAKER_02]: current state of, you know, local growing
in Humboldt County and has it really lived
[SPEAKER_02]: up to the expectations of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that, OK, so to make sure you
don't answer for us in that sense that I
[SPEAKER_03]: would say that there is a lot of division
in their opinion of whether or not the
[SPEAKER_03]: state of California or, you know,
any government agency was going to come in
[SPEAKER_03]: there and fix the medical freedom of
growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was a lot of doubt that that
would work and that specifically Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt and Southern Humboldt,
they were diametrically opposed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like Southern Humboldt voted down
the concept of legalization in California
[SPEAKER_03]: repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Northern Humboldt maybe supported it
the second time around.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think there is a lot of
doubt that that the taxation and the state
[SPEAKER_03]: of California would come in and
bureaucratically fix something like the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that the people might say that
they all saw this, you know, coming in the
[SPEAKER_03]: sense that it invites in big business and
it invites in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, heavy taxation is a problem because
it comes at every single level of
[SPEAKER_03]: government for a cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really strict from a federal level.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really strict from a state level.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got any entity in the state can can
tax you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of levies against it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people that want to do it
ecologically sensitive and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: make it like the smallest footprint they
can, which is the typical Humboldt small
[SPEAKER_03]: farm, they run against a lot of obstacles
that are just kind of baked into the
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think there's a ton of surprise
where we're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that, like, some people are
finding success and some people are
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, I told you so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Daniel and I come from that
resilience part of the trauma of knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: that things get really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you work hard and you persevere,
they get really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just like nature, everything
evolves and cycles and change is scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it can be really scary for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have a really long way to go
before we are normalized, meaning that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have policies that actually support a
successful and sustainable industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have a really huge gap between
folks like Daniel and myself and other
[SPEAKER_01]: folks that have this legacy of experience
and knowledge around the plant and new
[SPEAKER_01]: science and technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these mistakes are getting made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of what we're trying to do
with the legacy project in Humboldt-Grace
[SPEAKER_01]: is how do we get those two conversations
to talk more and connect and support each
[SPEAKER_01]: other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we know the magic behind this
plant, but we haven't broken it down into
[SPEAKER_01]: all the words and the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need that help to build a stable
industry, let alone a sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably a great segue for you
to talk about the project that you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: are building out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: To address some of these issues with the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Lele, I was hoping you could tell us a
bit about the legacy project and what
[SPEAKER_02]: problems is it really hoping to address?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Humboldt-Grace Foundation was
really created to help and empower and
[SPEAKER_01]: heal the communities that have been
impacted, like we discussed earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, nature always tells you
that you really have to start at the core
[SPEAKER_01]: to create any solutions or the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And personally, what my experience around
this plant has taught me that if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand your plant, it's really hard to
measure any of the other variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we as a community know that our
microclimates are unique because we have
[SPEAKER_01]: this amazing redwood curtain and so much
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that our processes are unique
because we've been working with this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know someone who's been working with
this plant for six generations in this
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have very unique understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the Daniel and I also told
you, the people and the culture are so
[SPEAKER_01]: unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the legacy project is a way to
start with that seed, with the genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we have volumes of genetic
diversity in these communities that has
[SPEAKER_01]: not even been touched for so many reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, there's very little understanding
that that's there and there's very little
[SPEAKER_01]: data to show that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, trust, you know, these some of these
genetics are considered, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the hope diamond in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people have put a lot of their
lives into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do we bring those together?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this event and this concept and this
vision was an idea to not only start
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing those things out, but to empower
all those small farmers that are being so
[SPEAKER_01]: impacted and they can't get through to
switch the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's grow right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's really know how our genetics are
curating in those microclimates,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we know a lot of us know that when
when Daniel grows skunk in his backyard
[SPEAKER_01]: and I grow skunk in my backyard,
they can come from the exact same mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're going to be slightly different
medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we really want to keep healing
people and we really want to utilize this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to what it's able to do,
then we have to start having the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation around the genetics,
the processes and the climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know and have seen already that as
the market grows and the consumer becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: more mature and product developers become
more mature, the only way to really have
[SPEAKER_01]: that product efficacy and create that
consumer loyalty that every brand and
[SPEAKER_01]: every company needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics are also a part of that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want our farmers to be growing all
those special things just like they used
[SPEAKER_01]: to not hurting, not negatively impacting
the environment and innovating,
[SPEAKER_01]: helping you, helping the industry
innovate, because we do have generations
[SPEAKER_01]: of knowledge, genetics and processes
around this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the legacy project is a way for all
us all of us to come together and start
[SPEAKER_01]: solving problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also a way to educate through the
vehicle of an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: In marketing, why these things are of
value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel, anything to add there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, my my motivation that's
intertwined and all that is, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the preservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, that's the, you know, one of these
great vehicles that the legacy project
[SPEAKER_03]: offers is people to come out of the
shadows with these genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a 40 year head start.
[SPEAKER_03]: In creating these local land races and
genetics that are critical to genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity in this like amazing plant,
which, you know, aids in cancer research
[SPEAKER_03]: and it aids in autism research and it aids
in wellness and self care in a time where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that's a really important factor
in how we manage our daily lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the diversity that exists there,
if we look at any other crop, that's grown
[SPEAKER_03]: in this kind of fashion, genetic diversity
becomes critical 50 years into the crop
[SPEAKER_03]: production where you need some diversity
to fight a pest or a pathogen or the
[SPEAKER_03]: stress that the environment is going to
incur over the next 30 years as drought
[SPEAKER_03]: sets in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, diversity is not just like
it's so critical and the legacy project
[SPEAKER_03]: and the awareness around cannabis genetics
is critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I look to Humboldt County is,
you know, this great wealth of genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really hope that everybody,
you know, is able to like access this
[SPEAKER_03]: resource that we all have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we've been privileged to
for many decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the more cultivators or
folks who are studying cannabis genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: each time I talk to them, they talk about
how a lot of the products we see on the
[SPEAKER_02]: shelves and dispensaries and everything,
the diversity is just not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all kind of, you know, high THC sort
of strains and it's all sort of the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if you could speak a
bit about some of the diversity that these
[SPEAKER_02]: legacy growers may be sitting on that we
might get to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the trend right now, you know,
if you make it simple, is high THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a certain kind of terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I don't want to pick on any
strands, so I won't name names,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, you know, the most popular things
that move up the leafy chain sometimes are
[SPEAKER_03]: the very same that like I'm a daily all
day smoker and I am not affected much by
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them give me a headache.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know which ones do and I know which
ones don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know which ones are going to keep me
up and which ones are going to help me go
[SPEAKER_03]: down and which ones before I play
basketball and, you know, which one before
[SPEAKER_03]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that people get, you know,
they're missing out a lot of like the
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's kind of painful to see,
you know, it's like, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you reduce everything to a data point
and all high THC sells faster and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, purple sells faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really locks you, you're locking
yourself out of experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, cannabis isn't about the
visual and it's about the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, the diversity is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, what won the Emerald Cup
this year came from Canada country for the
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeders Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a low THC, high fruit,
bred by one of the legacy farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, I happen to know Cherimoya.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is an old land race, which was one
of the influencing genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the best of the best and what is
reviewed the best when you have these
[SPEAKER_03]: competitions is not the highest THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not what's available in most
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you want to have the best
experience, you're going to have to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: connoisseur and people just, you know,
it's going to take time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And until then, we just kind of get to
enjoy these privileges firsthand,
[SPEAKER_03]: us, you know, up here in the sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also when you're talking about
business is people are going to want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get, you know, have a very
particular experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your brand represents something,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a hip hop show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a field of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But consumers are going to have that
expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like blunts and I got a blunt the other
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to, it was named by a very
feminine jeweler company and I bought that
[SPEAKER_01]: blunt and I expected like something that I
enjoyed and it was like skunky,
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky, like, or more gassy, probably like
a heavy OG, but they had named it this
[SPEAKER_01]: very feminine name.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get away with that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was really good weed,
but in five years from now, the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be so much more mature that
you're not going to be able to get away
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so brands and product makers,
we see them calling us calling our
[SPEAKER_01]: communities and saying, Hey, I really want
this experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we know is that this microclimate
does really high CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: This microclimate does, you know,
really high CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how can we help curate those for you
with what we already have here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of our breeders have been
testing in ways and working with this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in ways that they can tell you that
before that plant is fully developed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what are those strong traits
going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can actually happen a lot quicker
than people expect these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If folks are, I mean, if the market's
finally going to mature, we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get some more diversity on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to access more diverse plants
and that's where you guys can play a key
[SPEAKER_02]: role.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe that's a good segue into
talking about the auction that you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: are looking to put on and how a mechanism
like that can help sort of empower these
[SPEAKER_02]: legacy growers to protect their
intellectual property and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe get some recognition and some
compensation for all the work that they've
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Daniel mentioned the Emerald Cup and
folks who win the Emerald Cup get a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they get recognition.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of marketing that comes with
that that isn't on the way of that
[SPEAKER_01]: producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead of doing a contest,
we wanted to create more access to the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we already have seed
auctions and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we wanted to do was create a
way to promote and educate on more complex
[SPEAKER_01]: markets than just selling your seeds or
your plants, which are licensing
[SPEAKER_01]: agreements.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a cosmetic company could want a
certain genetic for just their skin care
[SPEAKER_01]: and another company could want the same
one for their drink line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a diverse market for a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two different licensing
agreements that they could create.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we feel there's a lot of power for
these small communities around those kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of that kind of market keeps everybody
small, keeps everybody innovative and
[SPEAKER_01]: curating around the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then then the big can go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really wanted Daniel and I have
been in these conversations around these
[SPEAKER_01]: particular this kind of licensing business
for, I don't know, about four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just always seemed like a really
good way to empower the high quality small
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer, which is really what our culture
was created around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet also educate the market on the
value of the genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so an auction, an event, I like
throwing hype events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like educating through those kind of
platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just thought as an opportunity,
we started with just saying, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: who wants to come?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're at a place where we have an
amazing blockchain company called
[SPEAKER_01]: Canopyright that has created a platform
that all breeders can engage in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for free, it doesn't cost unless you
start invoicing it through the through the
[SPEAKER_01]: metric system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is that allows anybody
to create a digital archive of ownership.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if their genetics get out into the
market without their knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have the first step to saying this is
mine, not yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really couldn't ask people to come
out of the, you know, start throwing their
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff out in the market and licensing
agreements unless they could protect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we wanted, you know, a lot of people
like to say, oh, we're the best in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is full of smoke screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to be authentic in what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really wanted to find a way to
authenticate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we chose we were we were
given the opportunity to use the pre 96
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk one as a beta test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we chose that is because it
does have so much controversy and
[SPEAKER_01]: notoriety.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just wanted something that we could
build authentication and validate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because there's so much controversy,
it's not going to be easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that means anything that follows,
it will be much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is it's our beta to help protect,
help authenticate and help validate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the auction is really an event as a
tool to make it exciting and bring it all
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, skunk is a lightning rod for
controversy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that component of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think like last week, you know,
they're circulating and calling each other
[SPEAKER_03]: out on Instagram, which is just like a
great WWF match sometimes you're watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're there, you know, signaling
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it about skunk that that is so
controversial?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is fake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets people's attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some of my favorite accounts are
responding to each other and have opposite
[SPEAKER_03]: views.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so I think the skunk is in the
same sense, mythological, where you're
[SPEAKER_03]: never going to get back to the original
skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just can't because there's no way to
prove it anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that building all of these
different skunk variations that are out
[SPEAKER_03]: here and tying them together and tying it
for what reasons is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the skunk's really interesting from a
scientific perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's scientifically, you know,
has something happening right now where
[SPEAKER_03]: they're tying the thiol, which is like a
unique component, constituents that
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't been tested for traditionally in
cannabis that, you know, a humbled state
[SPEAKER_03]: professor at one point was the first to
discover this compound in actual skunks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these different thiol variations,
you know, can indicate different skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the first tests that were,
you know, being published this year are
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of supporting that there's
associations here with these thiols and
[SPEAKER_03]: the smell of skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really exciting just from all
angles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you layer DNA and you layer
cannabinoids and you layer, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: popular opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's irresistible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to go meet an eighty four year old
archaeologist after this call who was a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of a group that took a pack of skunk
seeds that were brought back by a Karuk
[SPEAKER_01]: woman who's still alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's also in her 80s and they hid it in a
cave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to go talk to see if maybe
he wants to go pull him out of the cave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, those skunk seeds pre-exist these
other skunk seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're very old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's fun about it is because of all
the controversy, it's bringing up more
[SPEAKER_01]: information, more stories, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about is this mill, Frank,
pre whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about how do we honor those legacies
that brought it before us and how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: protect those and keep those that move
forward honor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because many more genetics are going to be
created.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all living up here for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know how much we like to make new
fun things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the science, people are going to
really be able to hone in on that more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just want to show that it's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's authentic and that it's worth the
value that we we're going to our
[SPEAKER_01]: validators are going to say it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to come back to something you
touched on before, Lele, when you were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about sort of all the generational
knowledge that's been accumulated in
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt and the Emerald Triangle over the
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sort of marrying that with sort of the
the new wave of research and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, I get excited at that because,
you know, at CanMed, that's that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're trying to do is trying to bring
people from different parts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry together to sort of collaborate
and sort of move the industry forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And typically, it's been sort of having
the health care providers talk with the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators to talk about, you know,
the cannabinoids that they're interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in to maybe inspire the cultivators to to
grow something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's another component,
too, right, where it's the legacy growers
[SPEAKER_02]: talking with, you know, the academics to
where there might be examples of things
[SPEAKER_02]: where I mean, you guys know just from
experience that, you know, when the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: looks a certain way or it's a certain
point in its development, you do X.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you might not understand really why
that is the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we if we can work together,
we can maybe determine why that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then even optimize from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes beyond just the science of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into just practical applications,
whether it be you're giving a lecture and
[SPEAKER_01]: you talk to someone in the legacy and they
can give you a perspective that you never
[SPEAKER_01]: had before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like it's like I look at it
as we are a region of Einstein's around
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant that have so much experience
that everyone who's engaging should want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Einstein is a part of that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've I am I'm trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trained as a nurse before my spinal
cord injuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little science background,
but not, you know, heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet I've been a part of an art to
artificial intelligence projects just
[SPEAKER_01]: because they wanted that understanding of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been a part I I helped influence
Dr. When a Dr. Mackey's talks on
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction just through a conversation
that he felt really impacted that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we got to bring those two
together to really make this industry as
[SPEAKER_01]: transformative as it can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to that point, the fact that you that
there is so much generational knowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: and experience up there in Humboldt and
the Emerald Triangle, how has there been
[SPEAKER_02]: any recruiters that have come up there and
tried to, you know, hire people to go work
[SPEAKER_02]: for, you know, a big corporate grow or
something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, would that even be something
that the folks up there would be
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we I have friends that are all over
the country right now helping people
[SPEAKER_01]: develop their growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't ever like to tell someone how to
live their life really, you know,
how to live their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And personally, I feel like we have to
integrate to educate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really supportive of legacy
operators going and working for larger
[SPEAKER_01]: companies or different companies to help
them not just learn about the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but learn about the values of our culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll carry it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But traditionally, we are definitely a
NIMBY society.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we definitely have shut people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think as this market evolves and as
our community transitions, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing that those are real opportunities
for them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I hope we do have more people come
up here recruiting and looking for support
[SPEAKER_01]: from from these areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you see it failing on the other end.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see it failing definitely in places
that aren't traditionally cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Locations, but maybe have experience in
agriculture in California and seeing them
[SPEAKER_03]: bring in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, we don't name names,
but big managers from other companies that
[SPEAKER_03]: are from the produce industry and are from
the cut flour industry and seeing what
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't convert and how that without that
cannabis experience, that it's definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: a recipe for failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're definitely seeing people come,
you know, after kind of making some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: worst mistakes and that they should save
themselves probably a lot of trouble and
[SPEAKER_03]: start by integrating the, you know,
the right kind of legacy cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: operator, somebody with, you know,
20 years of experience that still has
[SPEAKER_03]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've talked about how
genetically diverse this plant is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that genetic diversity means how it
responds to its environment, its food,
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you don't have someone that
understands those subtleties in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden, it can be a huge loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have someone that understands
those subtleties helping you with that
[SPEAKER_01]: garden or product making or whatever that
is, you end up being ahead of the market
[SPEAKER_01]: in that because there's so many shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean regulatory shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really just understanding of knowing
how to navigate with the plant and work
[SPEAKER_01]: with the plant that your company will
save.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to be mindful of your time here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before I let you go, I want to give you
an opportunity to share more information
[SPEAKER_02]: about the legacy project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can people learn more about it and
stay up to date with everything you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can go look at our website,
www.humboltgrace.org backslash legacy dash
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we meet every Friday we're going to be
meeting every other Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is a public meeting because we're
breaking out into working groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really anybody who's interested or
sees value for themselves and wishes to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring value is welcome to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost we're right now in the
process of getting ready to really launch
[SPEAKER_01]: the white paper around the whole vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll happen by March.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until then, anyone can reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can find us at the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: www.humboltgrace.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Daniel, why don't you let folks know
where they can find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he's he's he's the home of the
skunk right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hendrix dot farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We spell it uniquely with out the so many
vowels H E N D R X dot farm F A R M.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'd love to chat about genetics or
anyone had any questions, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we go on and on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can't wait to see you guys out in
Can Med in May.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's it's going to be a great
event and excited to have you guys out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and we'll talk about genetics out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, looking forward to it.
