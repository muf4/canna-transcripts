[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Amir Punja, and I'm pleased to
be here today to be able to talk to you
[SPEAKER_00]: about these amazing, interesting and
fascinating trichomes that are produced on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'd like to do is show you some
incredible images that if I can use the
[SPEAKER_00]: words awesome and incredible and beautiful
and so on, I'd like to be able to share
[SPEAKER_00]: this information with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to have your cell phones ready
in case you want to take photographs of
[SPEAKER_00]: these amazing display of images that I'm
going to be showing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's a developing cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant that's been grown
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the focus of this presentation,
of course, are the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the flowers that are produced at
the terminal ends of these of these
[SPEAKER_00]: particular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, when plants are grown
indoors, as you see here in this
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment with lighting,
the cannabis flowers are produced in large
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be ready for harvest in a very
short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it's these cannabis flowers
that bear all of these trichomes that I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to spend the next 28 minutes or so
talking to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work that I'll describe was conducted
on plants that were grown in greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: and greenhouses such as this, where you
see very controlled lighting, controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient regimes and controlled growth
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants are basically going to be
ready to be harvested in about seven
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to illustrate how the cannabis
flower matures, starting from when the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are switched off to give a 12-hour
photo period, over the course of three to
[SPEAKER_00]: four to seven weeks, these particular
flowers or inflorescences develop quite
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically, as you can see here on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: From about week three onwards,
they increase tremendously in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We refer to these as flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct terminology is inflorescence,
which is also used by some individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: just as flower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what they are are individual
flowers that are clustered together on
[SPEAKER_00]: this main stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you an image in the next few
slides of these individual flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not true flowers in that they
don't produce petals, but they have these
[SPEAKER_00]: bracts and they have the stigmas,
which are part of the female flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so taking a closer look at the
inflorescence or the flower head of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant, you see these stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the female structures that are
going to be collecting pollen if there was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you a scanning electron
micrograph of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this cannabis flower is pretty much a
cluster of individual smaller flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these stigmas then, as you see here,
have these hair-like projections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to place pollen grains,
as we did in this experiment, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen grains terminate and they will
fertilize this particular stigmata.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the plants that I showed you
earlier in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is week seven, ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the stigmatic structures that are
formed here on the surface of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at harvest or after harvest,
these are dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this manner, hung upside down for a
period of about five days, at which time
[SPEAKER_00]: then the flower buds will be removed and
they'll be ready for packaging and
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping off for use for medicine or
recreational or extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the flower buds are removed
prior to drying and they're placed on
[SPEAKER_00]: these trays and put into a drying room
where then they'll be dried for five days,
[SPEAKER_00]: at which time these are then ready for
packaging up and shipping off to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we refer to as the buds,
which is the essentially broken down
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence that I showed you early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when the cannabis flower approaches
maturity, those stigmas that I showed you
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier take on sort of an orangey-brown
color, which indicates they're ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly than that,
you notice these trichomes, these shiny
[SPEAKER_00]: pinpoint-like structures that are covering
the surface of the inflorescence leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the material then obviously that's
going to be manufacturing and containing
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the cannabinoids, the THC,
the CBD, and the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the focus of my study,
is to study the development of these
[SPEAKER_00]: various trichomes on the cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the cannabis bud in its glory.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is obviously ready to be used for
recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the dried up stigmas here,
these orangey-brown structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course are the trichomes,
which you'll see close-ups of here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the focus of my work,
is to study in detail what these trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a light microscope image.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see again these spiny projections,
these other trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're produced on these stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see close-up images of these stalks
when I go through my slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most producers will have seen this as
they examine their plants over a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're quite obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are quite obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we wanted to do was to use the
scanning electron microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a piece of equipment that actually
magnifies these trichomes considerably.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the images on the screen,
they're probably magnified over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows you to really study
detailed structure of what these cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the scanning microscope is used as
shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the large equipment, various parts
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sample is inserted into this chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the images that are being produced can
be captured here on these computer screens
[SPEAKER_00]: and then downloaded and saved and used in
presentations like the one I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what a scanning electron
microscope would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the machine itself is the
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tiny piece of brach tissue that
has trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We coat this with gold or palladium,
very, very fine layer to allow these
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons that are produced to be
scattered and emit images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the electrons originate from an
electron gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually what happens is the
electrons that are released are detected
[SPEAKER_00]: in an electron detector or images are sent
over to the screen where we can then
[SPEAKER_00]: visualize what's going on in this
particular chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you a couple of images done
by other researchers where they looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are pollen grains of different plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice the very, very fine detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: These spine-like structures, the size,
the shape, all different in these various
[SPEAKER_00]: different plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But notice how clear and three-dimensional
these particular images are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, if we use red blood cells,
the red blood cells in your body and my
[SPEAKER_00]: body, these are the platelets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see sort of a pancake-shaped
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are magnified many, many,
many times to show you the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance of red blood cells in the
electron microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to use this technique to
study not just trichome development,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to look at things like trichome
density, maturation, and quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how potentially these various features
could be used to assess things like THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBD that may be produced in this
particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, this is the inflorescence,
the entire structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at very, very small pieces,
as you see here, magnified over on the
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these tiny spicules that you see here
are the trichomes that we're now going to
[SPEAKER_00]: magnify in the scanning electron
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the first image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the trichomes, the glandular
trichomes that are born on stocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the surface of the bract or the
leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mid vein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how these trichome glands
or trichome heads appear under the
[SPEAKER_00]: scanning electron microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's another image.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows you a different trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the non-glandular trichomes,
what we call the hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the background, these structures,
these little smiley faces, these other
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata, these are involved in
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the plant takes up carbon
dioxide, releases oxygen in
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are other types of trichomes called
bulbous trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes that I'm going to focus on
here, these large glandular circular
[SPEAKER_00]: structures that we'll spend more time on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you a few close-up images of
these hair-like structures, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cannabis leaf that has many,
many of these non-glandular spines or
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see they do have a protective
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will protect against insects and
various other forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But notice too that the leaves do have
these globular round structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are also the sessile trichomes that
we'll speak to in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A close-up, if you are an insect,
this would be a pretty dangerous territory
[SPEAKER_00]: to enter into because of these various
hairs that are meant to protect the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: from attack by various types of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the glandular trichomes that
we'll spend some time studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the spiny projections that we
just saw that are most likely serving a
[SPEAKER_00]: protective function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these trichomes, the heads of these
trichomes, you can see here in this image
[SPEAKER_00]: that is of a dried cannabis flower or a
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how nicely they're
distributed over the surface of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very uniform, very nice and circular.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sample that has probably the
optimal amount of THC and CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a close-up of these mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are magnificent trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see they're surrounded by a
cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are individual trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you a close-up of the
trichome head sitting on the surface of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bract of leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can almost visualize these
miniature hot air balloons, if you wish,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are starting to accumulate THC and
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this manufacturing is occurring
within the trichome head itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The various enzymes are produced and are
working here within this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a magnificent site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next image that I'll show you is
even more magnificent because it shows you
[SPEAKER_00]: now this particular trichome head is
raised on a stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these stalks are very important in not
only pushing the trichome head above the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the leaf, but also it's
associated with maturation and
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation of various types of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those of you working in the medical
field, those of you using cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: various purposes and using it to make food
or produce various types of extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the image that I want you to
visualize of this magnificent trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: head that's sitting on the surface of a
stalk that's manufacturing all the
[SPEAKER_00]: materials that this particular conference
is all about, the THC, the CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: various cannabinoids, and of course,
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make an analogy of that
particular trichome head to a lamp,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lamp that's been powered by electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the larger, of course, the size of the
bulb that you place in here, the larger is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be your amount of light that's
emitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy in a cannabis trichome comes
from the bottom of the plant, the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis that's being pushed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the size, of course, of the
trichome head is going to illustrate how
[SPEAKER_00]: much light or how much THC you're actually
going to be producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much so that an artist that I met a few
years ago was able to draw out these
[SPEAKER_00]: particular trichome glands on a stalk such
as this and visualize the light source
[SPEAKER_00]: emitting from a trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be the cannabinoids,
the THC, and the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a wonderful sight to see these on
our streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is again, these magnificent
structures on these stalks, these other
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome heads then that are going to be
producing these various types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the small bulbous trichomes that
I talked about that we don't really know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to spend most of our time
now focusing on these structures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2005, there was evidence presented
that the enzymes involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture of THC and CBD and various
other terpenes are actually produced
[SPEAKER_00]: within that globular structure,
which I'm referring to as the trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a miniature factory,
if you wish, that's synthesizing these
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very important chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much so that you can visualize as this
trichome is being developed, the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming from the epidermis and other
cells in the plant is being used to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: the manufacture of these cannabinoids
within this particular glandular structure
[SPEAKER_00]: that's shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I mentioned, there is a stalk
that develops and this is very much
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost visualize this mushroom
gland starting to form and the stalk cells
[SPEAKER_00]: are derived from the epidermis,
the layers of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see it pushing itself up
and as it gets larger and more mature,
[SPEAKER_00]: these stalks continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow upward as the flower matures and
over time they get fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get fairly large as you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the cells of the epidermis
of the leaf cells that have been used to
[SPEAKER_00]: form the stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the large glandular head that's
now accumulating various types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite an impressive structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a closeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now the fully formed trichome head
that contains all of the THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and various other things that
we want to use for medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the stalk and you can see it's
attached here to the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the development of these
stalks and the size of the trichome heads
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the flower matures going from three
weeks to six weeks, what you see,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, is an increase in the length of
the stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also see an increase in the size
of the head that's being formed on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maturation is associated with an
expansion of the stalk and an expansion of
[SPEAKER_00]: the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of like that hotter balloon that I
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to summarize then,
these trichomes that we talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're called capitate trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're found on both sides of the bracts,
the upper and the lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're circular in shape, surrounded by a
cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the flower matures, these stalks
begin to elongate and the size of the head
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a slide that illustrates there's
way more trichomes on the underside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bract than there is on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what the significance of this
is, but you can see clearly there's way
[SPEAKER_00]: more of these trichome heads here than
there are on the surface of the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some experiments where we
actually monitored and counted how many of
[SPEAKER_00]: these trichome glands are actually being
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are two different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everywhere we see these dots just
signifies the location of these various
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's differences
between strains in terms of how many
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes are being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this data is illustrated in a graph
form here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the number of trichomes over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the flowers mature, the number of
trichomes goes up, as you see,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a maximum at about seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just illustrates here,
the underside of a trichome, of a leaf has
[SPEAKER_00]: way more trichomes than the upper side,
as you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a pretty significant
difference on whether you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the upper surface or the lower surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are some of these trichome
stalks that are absolutely crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one that is humongously long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really sure what the significance
of this is, but you can see it's a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome stalk compared to some of the
other ones in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether there's a significance to this
or not, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the importance of the stalk is that
it's an indication of maturation of those
[SPEAKER_00]: particular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhat so that this important study that
was published three years ago by
[SPEAKER_00]: Livingston and others demonstrated that as
these stalks get longer, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and the amount of cannabinoids
that are produced in the actual heads
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves is increased significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a significant increase in the
manufacture of these terpenoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids as a result of elongation of
the stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that as the
trichome stalks begin to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: so do the number of secretory cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of secretory cells that you see
here at the bottom of these trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: heads, the numbers go up so that as the
stalks begin to elongate and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes that are maturing, you have more
of these secretory cells that are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing all these cannabinoids,
which is shown here in this light blue
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the THC and the CBD produced
within these glandular structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are the stalks that we looked at
a few minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite a fascinating developmental
change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that happens as the
trichome heads mature is that you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: a difference in fluorescence under UV
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you shine UV light here on the
right, you can actually pick out where
[SPEAKER_00]: these glandular heads are, as opposed to
where you have normal visible light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that these
trichome heads, of course, contain
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, which fluoresce at a
wavelength of around 430 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can actually pick out these
individual trichome heads as shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was also demonstrated in this
paper that I described by Livingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a close-up of one of these
trichome heads here, the secretory cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're pumping out these cannabinoids
that are accumulating in this hot air
[SPEAKER_00]: balloon as it starts to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here the stalk that the
head is attached to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the base of the, or the top
of the actual stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, this is where the
trichome head was attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the next image, I show you a
cross-section through this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: stalk that shows you it consists of these
various cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the cells that make up the
stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the nutrients,
the photosynthates, are going to flow
[SPEAKER_00]: through the stalk up into the trichome
head to provide energy for the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing of these various
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite an amazing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the underside of the actual head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the trichome stalk would
attach to the bottom of the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was illustrated quite nicely in this
paper that was published a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It indicates where the stalk is actually
being attached to the underside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see right here the point of
connection where the stalk ends and the
[SPEAKER_00]: head is starting to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can show that in this schematic
representation where you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome head with the cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the secretory cells that we
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers go up as the length of the
trichome stalk increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this balloon structure starts to
increase the accumulation of various types
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an underside view of the
secretory cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all secreting various
cannabinoids that are filling this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular balloon or cavity over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a dried cannabis trichome
stalk, as you see here, with the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome head still attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, you can almost visualize
the contents here, which is obviously all
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these things do become detached.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you know that you can collect
these various trichome heads and use it to
[SPEAKER_00]: make things like hashish and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the point of attachment of the
stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's another illustration where it's
come off from the stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got your entire trichome
head that contains all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, very similar to a hot air balloon
that's become detached.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to summarize, the stalk
development is an important part of
[SPEAKER_00]: maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these stalks start to develop,
you start to see tremendous increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: the accumulation of these various
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: What causes the stalks to elongate?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are some stalks longer than others?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why do we have more trichomes on the
underside of a bract as opposed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: upper surface?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still a lot of research that
still has to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try to resolve these various aspects of
trichome development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the heads do dehist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of the glands coming off is
called dehistence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you harvest these things
and cause damage, then these trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: heads can break off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of a good sample,
a sample that's well preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the trichome heads are
still attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dried cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a flower where there's been
some abuse or not well taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see where all the heads have
broken off, leaving much less THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabinoids in this particular
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have to be careful when we handle these
cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last thing I'd like to talk about
is the maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a phase where the trichomes
literally undergo a maturation or
[SPEAKER_00]: senescence process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is accompanied by the
accumulation of a brown color within the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome heads themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to study this under the
electron microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the mature trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see little droplets of
exudate starting to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where now the resin is starting to
become pushed out of the trichome head
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can actually see that because what
happens is that when the resin comes off,
[SPEAKER_00]: it causes the surface of the trichome head
to become sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these little heads start to stick
to one another, as you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those of you that have handled
cannabis flowers that are developing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the sticky residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's being secreted out of those
trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a closeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bulging, this is the resin that's
being actually pushed out through the
[SPEAKER_00]: head, through the cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see actually the exudate
actually dribbling down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pouring down from the actual trichome head
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite an amazing view when you look
at it here under the scanning microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens of course is because of
the sticky nature of the surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have what I consider these hot cross
buns.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trichome heads sticking together as
a result of the resin that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here again, you get these large blobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all because of resin that's come
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trichome heads have stuck to one
another to form these blobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's another indication of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are large structures that are caused
by the exudation of that resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happens at maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just a low power shot to show
you the sticking together of the trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: heads as a result of secretion of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that happens of course is
there is this process of senescence,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I consider aging.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right is a trichome that's starting
to age.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left is a trichome that's still
fairly young in the developmental process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take a look at these aging
trichomes, the actual heads themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you notice there's a wrinkling of the
surface of the cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost like a sort of a prune shaped image
as you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very, very high powered
magnification picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what happens over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resinous material starts to condense.
[SPEAKER_00]: To form this cakey like substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time, it looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a completely senescent or aging
trichome head that has the resinous
[SPEAKER_00]: material just completely sort of collapsed
and baked down on the surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this close up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This entire wrinkling is all the resinous
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cuticle has broken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an older, aged, mature
trichome head that's shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take a low power image of
this particular view, what you do see is
[SPEAKER_00]: that these trichome heads that have
senesced or old can be seen here as
[SPEAKER_00]: they're shriveled up images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just to summarize, droplets of
resin are released from these trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: heads, causes them to become sticky,
and it results in the formation of these
[SPEAKER_00]: various blobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the resin then causes these particular
trichome heads to collapse, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the last phase, which is the
senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of a good sample on the
left where the trichome heads are all
[SPEAKER_00]: intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right is a sample that isn't
processed very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichome heads have broken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very few of them left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scanning microscope can actually show
you differences in quality between a good
[SPEAKER_00]: sample on the left and a poor sample on
the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that can be done,
something we're looking at now before I
[SPEAKER_00]: end, is using computer-assisted technology
to determine the numbers of trichomes on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flowers and the various types of
maturation phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done here is circled the
various trichome heads, whether they're
[SPEAKER_00]: mature in the red, whether they're
immature in the white, and then the mature
[SPEAKER_00]: ones in between, which are the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so using these computer-enhanced
systems, we can almost tell where these
[SPEAKER_00]: various trichome heads are and how many
they are in a very, very short period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we'd like to
work on to demonstrate how
[SPEAKER_00]: computer-assisted technology can be used
to assess maturation of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll end here with some images that are
generated through this computer-assistance
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: These circles illustrate where the
trichomes are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the differences between these
two samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another image generated by the
computer that shows you the various types
[SPEAKER_00]: of trichomes that are found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, this one that
illustrates the senescence, mature
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome glands that are shown in brown
compared to the previous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this image analysis using
computer technology is going to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: important for us to decipher trichome
numbers and maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, trichomes are fascinating
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I've shown you some amazing images
to illustrate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of things we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What initiates their development?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there effect of light, other signals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do these trichome stocks develop to
various extents?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we use this kind of technology to
assess trichome development and optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: time of harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be very, very important from a
commercial perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Various individuals have contributed to
this research, various funding agencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and various people have helped me with
collection of these various images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope what I've done with this
presentation is show you some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectacular images of cannabis trichome
development and the various things that go
[SPEAKER_00]: on that I think are going to be
commercially extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I wasn't able to attend the
meeting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this presentation will give you
some ideas for thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions, please send them
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be at my computer right now
as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be happy to take questions,
answer these either right away or anytime
[SPEAKER_00]: when you've had time to digest this
particular information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your attention and I wish
you all the best in the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
