[SPEAKER_02]: I think one thing that CanMet does so well
is it demonstrates that this field is
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a ton of research in different
aspects of the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's well funded and there's a lot of
scientific interest and that this is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't just anecdotal data.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is real scientific evidence and a lot
of valid interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's real open.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy to get out and speak to
people one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already seen more cannabis science
here and I've been in cannabis science for
[SPEAKER_00]: six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen more of it concentrated here
than anywhere else before.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my first CanMet and I'm so
impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been able to sleep for three
days because of all the information and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's stimulating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my second year here and it's
always full of information and it's really
[SPEAKER_04]: important to participate in this
conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to get many minds involved to
solve really complicated problems and you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to take a very distributed approach
so that you push innovation to the edge of
[SPEAKER_03]: networks and allow for this type of
permissionless innovation.
Thank you very much.
you
