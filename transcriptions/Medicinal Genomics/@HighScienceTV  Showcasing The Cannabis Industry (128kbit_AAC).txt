[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for a lot of us in the industry,
we take a lot of this information for
[SPEAKER_00]: granted and assume that it's common
knowledge, but it really isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a show like this that's more
accessible to the general public so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can start understanding what we
already know is very powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran up against that one at the History
Channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we first took over History,
there was a lot of criticism that we were
[SPEAKER_02]: showing shows that weren't really about
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, well, everything we do is
about history.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we did find was that television
is a wonderful means of expressing
[SPEAKER_02]: emotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a terrible means of giving
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I say, it's a great emotional.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like, you see a cotton commercial
and you cry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it triggers people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the most successful thing we did at
History was that it wasn't so much that we
[SPEAKER_02]: were just reciting a historical
encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got people excited about history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as they got excited about history,
we went from the number 34 network up to
[SPEAKER_02]: number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people knew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get them excited about American
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go onto the internet and they learn
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, if we get people excited about
cannabis, they'll start doing their
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll come back to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll find you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rather than having to go to their
conference, they'll be doing their own
[SPEAKER_02]: research because of their passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll find you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other beauty about the show,
a lot of people think that these
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurs are just sitting back making
boatloads of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fighting for their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: The millions and millions of dollars that
it takes to build a growth, an indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, the amount of money that it takes
to open a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only the regulations, you've got
federal, state, county, parish,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending where you are, which is changing
daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stick around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll change in the next 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like banks close you down for no
reason because we don't have safe banking
[SPEAKER_01]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you work in a cannabis industry,
you can't go buy a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't buy a house because you're using
federally illegal money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's the same damn money that's in
my pocket that's in yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the list goes on of what these
poor guys, men and women in this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: are fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we touch on all of it in the show to
show people that, hey, it's not all
[SPEAKER_01]: champagne and pop and corks.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are actually busting their
butts because they believe so much in this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're willing to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what high science is all about,
is showing all of it.
Thank you.
