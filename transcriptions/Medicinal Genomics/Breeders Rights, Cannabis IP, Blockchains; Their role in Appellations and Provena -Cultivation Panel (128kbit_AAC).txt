[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to spend some time just opening
up some of the background behind this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So as I had just mentioned, we have been
doing a fair amount of sequencing and
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to de-risk what has been,
I think, effectually termed lately,
[SPEAKER_09]: surveillance capitalism, where we're all
finding our data is getting harvested by
[SPEAKER_09]: other entities that might house that data
and sometimes being used in ways that
[SPEAKER_09]: we're not all excited about.
[SPEAKER_09]: This certainly has happened in genomics
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen this with 23andMe.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen this with a variety of
companies.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes it's completely voluntary
and the terms and conditions are really
[SPEAKER_09]: clear about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's actually some informed consent
that goes on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And other times there are very long terms
and conditions that people click through
[SPEAKER_09]: and don't realize what their data is going
to get used for.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we thought this would be a helpful
discussion in light of what we've seen
[SPEAKER_09]: recently in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've certainly seen a few companies in
the space collect data from people under
[SPEAKER_09]: the intent of helping them, only to then
turn around and compete with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this got a lot of discussions brewing
about, well, should we be patenting our
[SPEAKER_09]: work and should we be putting it open
source and which models are going to work
[SPEAKER_09]: for the cannabis industry as we see
different types of capital investment come
[SPEAKER_09]: into the field.
[SPEAKER_09]: Traditionally, we do see a lot of capital
investment coming in that works on the
[SPEAKER_09]: paradigm of patenting things and getting
things through the SEC and being publicly
[SPEAKER_09]: traded.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that does change.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very different than the cannabis
industry that has been around for the last
[SPEAKER_09]: 80 years, where there's been a lot more
sharing going on and sharing cuts and
[SPEAKER_09]: sharing genetics and everyone working off
of the shoulders of somebody else.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to spend some time just at
first just to introduce the panelists here
[SPEAKER_09]: and let them each introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get an understanding of the type of
people we've collected to discuss this
[SPEAKER_09]: topic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I'll start with my left here
with Trevor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Trevor Witke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the executive director of the
Calaveras Cannabis Alliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a second generation cannabis farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been growing for my entire adult life
for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my primary passion through the entire
time that I've been cultivating has been
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was handed marijuana botany when I was
16 years old and given that as my
[SPEAKER_05]: introduction into cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when Kevin extended an invitation
to come down and talk about the future of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis genetics and the implications
that it has in terms of cultural
[SPEAKER_05]: resources, genetic resources, and how
that's going to impact traditional
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I jumped at the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm grateful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the invite.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot going on in this space
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that this is really cannabis
genetics, as Kevin just pointed out,
[SPEAKER_05]: are incredibly plastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a unique genome that we're
working with here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is very under understood.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a limited knowledge base here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think before we rush off and start
tinkering with it, starting with things we
[SPEAKER_05]: should sit back, understand what we're
dealing with, and understand the long-term
[SPEAKER_05]: implications for the genome and for the
people who have produced this plant and
[SPEAKER_05]: have dedicated their lives to it for
decades and generations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Janine Coleman, and I'm the
executive director and founder of Origins
[SPEAKER_03]: Council, which is a nonprofit organization
devoted to establishing legal geographic
[SPEAKER_03]: indication protections for cannabis in
support of sustainable economic
[SPEAKER_03]: development for cannabis-producing
regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to take the opportunity to offer
a brief introduction to geographic
[SPEAKER_03]: indication systems for those of you that
are not familiar with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: GEIs are a legal standards-based
designation that are awarded to products
[SPEAKER_03]: of place, products that you're familiar
with that wear geographic indications or
[SPEAKER_03]: champagne, Bordeaux, Parma ham,
tequila.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these designations recognize and
codify regional intellectual property
[SPEAKER_03]: rights of producing regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these intellectual property rights are
tied to region-specific agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: practices and product quality standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a number of deliverables tied to
geographic indications.
[SPEAKER_03]: First and foremost, they're a regulatory
framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the designations are awarded by a
regulatory agency and therefore carry the
[SPEAKER_03]: authority and the enforcement capability
of a regulatory agency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're very strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a lot of legal strength.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the associated standards are framed
around product quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore, they are very strong in
building consumer loyalty and can be very
[SPEAKER_03]: strongly leveraged for market
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the designations are place-based,
there's a number of deliverables to the
[SPEAKER_03]: region with respect to standards
protections for the environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as building the renown and
reputation of the region, which can drive
[SPEAKER_03]: economic development opportunities such as
agritourism.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geographic indication systems have tiered
designations.
[SPEAKER_03]: In California, we have two designations
that have been created in state law.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have County of Origin for cannabis and
Appalachians of Origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to give you a sense, County of
Origin is technically a indication of
[SPEAKER_03]: source.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's really no standards
associated with it other than it was
[SPEAKER_03]: produced in the designated region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appalachians of Origin, by contrast,
have a lot of standards associated with
[SPEAKER_03]: them because the designation is really
awarded to products that can prove that
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a essential link between the
quality of the product and the place,
[SPEAKER_03]: inclusive of environmental factors,
and also the practices of the farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as Trevor spoke to, they're an
enormous tool to really protect genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: resources as well as cultural resources of
the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very excited to present today and
talk about how this ties into protections
[SPEAKER_03]: for cultivars in particularly
legacy-producing regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank you all for having me here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a plant scientist and a patent
attorney.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I founded a law firm earlier this year
called Plant and Planet Law Firm.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm here because I know about
patents.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's why I was invited.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have worked in, well, a little bit of
background.
[SPEAKER_08]: My bachelor's degree is in botany,
a master's in genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did a PhD in molecular and cell
biology studying seed development.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I went to law school because I knew
by then I didn't want to be a professor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And since I finished law school,
I've worked in a few different law firms
[SPEAKER_08]: representing plant breeders, among other
different kinds of companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: In connection with the work I've done with
plant breeders, I have helped them
[SPEAKER_08]: identify appropriate strategies for
protecting their genetics and for
[SPEAKER_08]: commercializing them all over the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've probably done
commercialization agreements and protected
[SPEAKER_08]: intellectual property in at least 20
countries, probably closer to 30 over the
[SPEAKER_08]: 23 years that I've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got into the cannabis industry by being
asked if I would consult on legal topics
[SPEAKER_08]: for a group that was looking at IP policy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it related to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then since then, I have gotten more
and more involved in the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now consider that the work I do with
plant breeders is probably the,
[SPEAKER_08]: well, it's definitely the most exciting
work that I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I consider it the most important work
that I've done.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that, and I may elaborate this
on this later, but I believe that the kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of old school self-trained plant breeders
that are passionate about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_08]: that each have their own collections of
genetics they've developed and seeds and
[SPEAKER_08]: plants that they have collected and
received from others.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that constitutes the greatest
army of R&D that the world has ever seen
[SPEAKER_08]: in terms of really meaningful developments
on the frontier of medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's one of our challenges to
figure out how to tap into that army
[SPEAKER_08]: instead of having it become left behind in
the industrialization of cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_08]: big money aspects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's become sort of a cause for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's also something that I'm very
excited to talk about and write about.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm glad to be here with the rest of
the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Christian Saussier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the founder and principal consultant
at CryptoTech.Guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this panel, I'm the only one who
doesn't know much about genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here for information science.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what we've heard even this
morning when we were talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: need for more information, more clinical
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just mentioned all the little farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have information right now that could
save lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just don't know how to aggregate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My expertise over the last five,
six years has been to apply what I'll call
[SPEAKER_00]: this peer-to-peer consensus protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it has blockchains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply these technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These new formulas to reach an
understanding between people who don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the magic of it in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Applying that to other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the more successful space in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Applied it to fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having sensors in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following the product all the way to the
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using these technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fisheries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could be applied to many
things, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis is, I believe, one of the
most exciting opportunities for the
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the growing industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis industry has a need to
better share or share information in
[SPEAKER_00]: better ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do that, we also want to make
sure we recognize where the information
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two generation farmer, the lawyers,
the labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of players.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just can't expect there to be
heavy contracts between all the players in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where some of the information
technology that I believe I can bring here
[SPEAKER_00]: to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking forward to speak to you
guys about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's pretty apparent with the
recent vitamin E acetate outbreak,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you want to call it that, that
traceability of products is becoming
[SPEAKER_09]: increasingly clear.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still unclear to me where these
things came from and how they got into the
[SPEAKER_09]: testing or through the testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Testing systems that we have.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of my reasons for wanting to
invite Christian on here with Janine is
[SPEAKER_09]: that this sounds like Appalachians to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know your grower.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what their methods are.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, bringing Dale and someone
who's actually grown a plant here is,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, very important.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the equation to understand how do we
build these things so that they're
[SPEAKER_09]: protectable and that the small farmer does
not, in fact, get squeezed out of this
[SPEAKER_09]: based on the bud lightification of
cannabis, if you will.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dale, do you want to touch on just maybe
the background on the different flavors of
[SPEAKER_09]: IP that are out there that people can
consider?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are someone who has a cannabis
plant or cannabis genetics and you want to
[SPEAKER_08]: protect it, the first question is,
how are you going to commercialize it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there are different forms of
protection available for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_08]: each of which can be completely
ineffective if it's not aligned well with
[SPEAKER_08]: your commercialization strategy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're selling clones, then you
really, really need a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: A plant patent is a form of patent
protection that is like a copyright on a
[SPEAKER_08]: plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It only protects asexual propagation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only infringed by asexual propagation
of a particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're making clones, that's your
form of protection.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the other hand, if you're selling
seeds, a plant patent doesn't really give
[SPEAKER_08]: you any effective protection except
perhaps to give some protection if you're
[SPEAKER_08]: if you have some important parents of
those seeds, then you may well want to
[SPEAKER_08]: protect those parents with a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the alternative is something called a
utility patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: It treats a plant as more of just any
other kind of invention, and it lets you
[SPEAKER_08]: claim protection for the plant by way of
protecting, of claiming its seeds,
[SPEAKER_08]: any kind of its progeny, using the plant
variety in a method of breeding.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can protect extracts of the plant and
so on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for example, if your business is all
about extracts and you've got some really
[SPEAKER_08]: great underlying genetics, you would need
a utility patent to really protect that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So and then for people in the hemp space,
there's a newly available kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: protection provided by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not new to other players in the seed
industry, but it's new for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: The USDA Plant Variety Protection Act
permits protection of seed-propagated
[SPEAKER_08]: varieties, and since the passage of the
2018 Farm Bill, it also protects
[SPEAKER_08]: asexually-propagated varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: The tricky part of that is that if you
want to file a USDA PVP application,
[SPEAKER_08]: you have to submit a seed sample,
and those seeds have to be seeds that the
[SPEAKER_08]: government can legally accept.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's only applicable currently to
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not available for high THC
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_08]: So coming back to that, if you've got
seeds you want to protect and they've got
[SPEAKER_08]: high THC, you've really got to get a
utility patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of all, just call somebody who knows
what they're doing, and they can help you
[SPEAKER_08]: out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do we bring Appalachians into
this?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've grown a plant, let's say,
in Humboldt County or Mendocino,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's a unique terroir.
[SPEAKER_09]: Appalachians aren't necessarily a
recognized form of intellectual property
[SPEAKER_09]: at the USPTO, but they're certainly
legally recognized as something with
[SPEAKER_09]: weight to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: How does one go about choosing each of
these paths?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to take that one?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it a start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a journey with respect to
policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And starting, California has an amazing
propensity to really set the bar with
[SPEAKER_03]: respect to policy reform for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do have in-state law, and the
California Department of Food and Ag is
[SPEAKER_03]: charged with developing a regulatory
framework to support geographic
[SPEAKER_03]: indications for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So working on Appalachians of origin,
and as I mentioned, we have County of
[SPEAKER_03]: origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is case law with American
viticultural areas, which are the GIs that
[SPEAKER_03]: we have in the United States for wine,
that GIs are very strong with respect to
[SPEAKER_03]: the protections associated with them,
and in fact, take precedence over
[SPEAKER_03]: trademarks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some pretty rigorous
protections that we can start to build
[SPEAKER_03]: upon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And policy reform is simultaneous right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's work happening today, in fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the United Nations with consideration
of the World Health Organization's
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations to reschedule cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The World Intellectual Property
Organization is looking at some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: protections with respect to cannabis for
genetic resources, cultural resources,
[SPEAKER_03]: and also cannabis as a traditional
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think between what California is
doing to set precedence around GIs and
[SPEAKER_03]: what is happening on the international
level, there's a pressure that's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: really unfold with the national level of
policy reform.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some bills that have recently
passed in both Oregon and being
[SPEAKER_03]: entertained in California with respect to
trade between legalized states.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how we can start to fold some of
these policies into those types of
[SPEAKER_03]: agreements and really further the policy
pathway for geographic indications for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we've seen also in the same
vein in the food business, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: similar when you look at labels like
organic, fair trade, and the very many
[SPEAKER_00]: labels out there, you never know for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package has a stamp, but really the
evidence is what would prove that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: organic or fair trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, that evidence is very,
very difficult to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's organizations, obviously,
that are defending these labels so that
[SPEAKER_00]: organic still means something to
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even the people in charge of defending
these labels, and I've talked to many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, are a little freaked out because
it's really hard to defend these labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evidence that can be brought to bear,
did I cultivate this plant according to
[SPEAKER_00]: organic or did I transport it in the right
environment, right humidity, and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we need to know about the
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: The information that we need to know about
the product at the end of the supply,
[SPEAKER_00]: that information can be now captured and
moved in parallel with the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good at moving product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, our supply chains can move
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can move product, but the information
gets tampered with in between,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes you buy something that might
not be fair trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a way to defend these is to have a
system, an information system,
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows throughout the supply chain
the ability to capture data that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: seen as evidence that the farmer have an
organic or some other accreditation by the
[SPEAKER_00]: right accreditation body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, that is a piece of information
that could be known if we knew how to
[SPEAKER_00]: convey the information with the product.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what Christian's trying to say,
he may not realize that no one ever
[SPEAKER_09]: counterfeits anything in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: How would you feel about an Appalachian?
[SPEAKER_09]: Clearly, you're in a district that will
probably be one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Janine and I were both on the state
working group, and we discussed with state
[SPEAKER_05]: regulators the rollout of the Appalachia
program.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see this as an opportunity for us to
create intellectual property rights that
[SPEAKER_05]: are community property rights and not just
necessarily property rights that are held
[SPEAKER_05]: by individual corporations or individual
private entities.
[SPEAKER_05]: By having GIs and community-based
Appalachia systems, producers come
[SPEAKER_05]: together, and this is honestly the only
place that California's regulatory system
[SPEAKER_05]: actually gives control and local control
to cultivators.
[SPEAKER_05]: Licensed cultivators get to come together,
establish standards, procedures,
[SPEAKER_05]: and cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people in my county,
in my area, who have been cultivating and
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding for decades and generations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those particular cultivars that they have
bred in these areas are unique and
[SPEAKER_05]: specific to our area.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our job to try to come together and
establish these norms and procedures
[SPEAKER_05]: around these cultivars to protect them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The legislature's done a good job by
giving the cultivators and the licensees
[SPEAKER_05]: the actual opportunity to establish these
standards, procedures, and cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, I think that this is a unique
opportunity for us to be able to preserve
[SPEAKER_05]: and protect the value that we've created
in the preceding decades and generations
[SPEAKER_05]: before legalization came into effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think that what Christian brought
up is incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that we need to do is
establish the scientific basis for
[SPEAKER_05]: demonstrating that there is a unique and
uniform product that we are producing in
[SPEAKER_05]: our particular geographic regions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to differentiate that between our
region and other regions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I live in Calaveras County.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the Sierra Foothills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our environment is incredibly different
relative to the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's much more arid.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost semi-desert.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have very different
outcomes even with the exact same clones
[SPEAKER_05]: than they're going to have simply based on
the environmental effects of our area.
[SPEAKER_05]: A particular clone grown in the Emerald
Triangle versus a particular clone grown
[SPEAKER_05]: in Calaveras County, even though they are
the exact same genetic material,
[SPEAKER_05]: produces two different outcomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are ways that we can, through the
data and through the science of it,
[SPEAKER_05]: doing lab testing, doing genomic testing,
and also collating all of this data and
[SPEAKER_05]: aggregating it within the Appalachia
system, we're going to be able to prove
[SPEAKER_05]: that there are unique distinct outcomes
that are tied to place and that are tied
[SPEAKER_05]: to the cultivars that we have
traditionally bred.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that is going to
essentially, once we move into a much more
[SPEAKER_05]: uniformed commodities market, the thing
that's going to differentiate products
[SPEAKER_05]: within the future cannabis space is going
to be the ability to create value added
[SPEAKER_05]: and differentiation between products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appalachias are going to be one of the key
basis for us to do that, and the science
[SPEAKER_05]: is going to be absolutely vital.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being able to track all of it back and to
demonstrate that this plant came from this
[SPEAKER_05]: place, was grown with these practices,
and we have the data to show that this has
[SPEAKER_05]: actually happened, that's what's going to
create the value added, because if
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody's just producing a clone and not
living up to the standards that are set
[SPEAKER_05]: and established and the unique outcomes
that are tied to those standards and
[SPEAKER_05]: practices, then we're going to see the
devaluation of these unique areas of
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: To my mind, the Appalachia system creates
the most open and communally based system
[SPEAKER_05]: for developing an IP for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It allows the consumers access and
information to the actual data,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it provides the cultivators and the
traditional producers a means and a
[SPEAKER_05]: mechanism through which to demonstrate and
differentiate their products from other
[SPEAKER_05]: products that may be mass produced or may
not live up to the standards.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could comment, as long as we're
talking about the way things could be done
[SPEAKER_08]: in the future, one of the things that's a
real problem right now is the utter chaos
[SPEAKER_08]: around the naming of different strains or
cultivars and correlating that back with
[SPEAKER_08]: anything that's meaningful.
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as we're putting things on the
blockchain, I would love to see some kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of a DNA fingerprint that says,
this is the standard for this cultivar,
[SPEAKER_08]: this is what it really is, this is how you
know that it is what you think it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can picture scanning a QR code and
getting verification that this cultivar is
[SPEAKER_08]: real, some information about the
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are different layers of value.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a genuine genetics cultivated
in a certain place under certain
[SPEAKER_08]: conditions and then move through the
supply chain in certain ways that assure
[SPEAKER_08]: the quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you've got a lot more protection for
the consumer and you can ask a higher
[SPEAKER_08]: price.
[SPEAKER_08]: A premium farmer, premium genetics,
doing everything right ought to get a much
[SPEAKER_08]: higher price.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to add to that because this is what
really reminded me of what Christian was
[SPEAKER_09]: doing at a company called ripe.io.
[SPEAKER_09]: Traditionally, exceed to sell tracking has
become this dirty word now in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's mainly a dirty word because
the databases are centralized and the
[SPEAKER_09]: people harvesting that data aren't
necessarily delivering any of the rewards
[SPEAKER_09]: of that information aggregation back to
the people who delivered the data.
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're seeing now in many other
genomic industries, there's a company that
[SPEAKER_09]: George Church has recently founded called
Nebula Genomics.
[SPEAKER_09]: What they're attempting to do is invert
the model of genomic aggregation of
[SPEAKER_09]: information from the 23andMe model,
which is very centralized, to giving the
[SPEAKER_09]: access and the keys to that DNA sequence
information on a blockchain to the
[SPEAKER_09]: patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: The patients can opt in and decide to sell
that data to Roche if they want to.
[SPEAKER_09]: The patient gets the reward, not
necessarily the central aggregator of that
[SPEAKER_09]: information.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's ways that this can be done
in the food industry that I want to throw
[SPEAKER_09]: the ball to you, Christian, because I
think you've seen this happen before.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some challenges doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There definitely are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the first concern about these
blockchains to be addressed is the fear of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the open and the free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blockchains are open indeed, but the
openness is there for anyone to come into
[SPEAKER_00]: the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmer who does not have a big brand
can come into the blockchain network and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey, I've got a unique product
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: The openness is in the accessibility of
collaborating on the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're on the network, the
blockchain, and that's what we did for
[SPEAKER_00]: food, it can be very private.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be anonymous even in some cases if
that's what the industry needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The private deals and the exchange of
information between commercial parties,
[SPEAKER_00]: the building of commercial brands and
reputation, all of that is very available
[SPEAKER_00]: on these open blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, specifically to what you're talking
about, Kevin, the food and even the wine
[SPEAKER_00]: business are ahead of cannabis in this
particular space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already seeing a number of
commercial players, including one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: own startups, ripe.io, that looks at the
traceability problem, the trust problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there evidence that this Colombian
coffee was grown, again, in fair trade
[SPEAKER_00]: practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: These questions are, it's new technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to suggest that these
networks are super well established,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's many commercial partners right
now that are building competing
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchains for the dissemination and the
certification of information that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: with your steak or with your fish or with
your cannabis or with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really something the industry needs
to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other industries that have faced
very similar problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is more exciting because there is
a tradition of the small farmer doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tradition needs to be preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tradition built this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have an information system and
a certification process that respects
[SPEAKER_00]: these pioneers that actually built the
medicine that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to speak to enforcement because,
and by that I mean enforcement of the
[SPEAKER_03]: certifications and the standards
associated with it because that's really
[SPEAKER_03]: where the rubber meets the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in very early iterations of track
and trace systems for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say this cautiously, but there is
a benefit to prohibition in that the rigor
[SPEAKER_03]: of intent behind track and trace will
drive I think more accountability with
[SPEAKER_03]: respect to those systems developing for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, with geographic indications,
what you have is you have regional shared
[SPEAKER_03]: buy-in, shared motivation, shared
intellectual property rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a motivation on the part of the
designated community to really drive the
[SPEAKER_03]: enforcement of their own standards as
well, to maintain the quality and
[SPEAKER_03]: reputation of their product.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a very unique and I think powerful
dual enforcement mechanism with respect to
[SPEAKER_03]: geographic indications because you have
that community buy-in to really ward off
[SPEAKER_03]: counterfeit products and to really adhere
to the quality and standards that you have
[SPEAKER_03]: communally created.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a really powerful
differentiator for geographic indication
[SPEAKER_03]: systems with respect to where the rubber
meets the road with enforcement of
[SPEAKER_03]: standards.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to throw this back to Dan.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to scale a little bit in regards to
patent pools.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing a lot of terms like community
genetics and community information and I
[SPEAKER_09]: know there's another mechanism that you've
been thinking about on how to create
[SPEAKER_09]: patent pools that might be able to,
almost like asymmetric warfare in the
[SPEAKER_09]: intellectual property space.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_08]: My parents would be so proud.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all about asymmetric warfare now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, one of the questions I am asked most
often as a patent attorney, by growers and
[SPEAKER_08]: breeders is, can Monsanto make me stop
growing my own plants?
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the answer to that is no,
but there's a little bit of a yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: The no is, if they're your own plants and
you've got them and they predate anybody
[SPEAKER_08]: else's patents or whatever, then in terms
of patent protection, no one can come in
[SPEAKER_08]: and tell you to stop growing your own
plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way it works in the real world in some
other, in the commodity ag space is that a
[SPEAKER_08]: company that has vast access to technology
and money can make better and better
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds, better in terms of not necessarily
taste or anything, but in terms of
[SPEAKER_08]: productivity, in terms of how many dollars
can you squeeze out of an acre of land or
[SPEAKER_08]: a growing season?
[SPEAKER_08]: They can build some of those technologies
right into the seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a commodity farmer, you end up
facing a choice of either buying the seeds
[SPEAKER_08]: from that source and growing them with
enough efficiency that you can sell them
[SPEAKER_08]: for less or for more than it costs you to
produce them, or your other choice is to
[SPEAKER_08]: continue growing the seeds you've always
grown less efficiently and face a
[SPEAKER_08]: commodity pricing structure where it may
actually cost you more to produce your
[SPEAKER_08]: product than you can sell it for.
[SPEAKER_08]: In that way, powerful, technology forces
in a commodity market really can put
[SPEAKER_08]: people in a position of either adopting
that technology or of going out of
[SPEAKER_08]: business or losing money perpetually.
[SPEAKER_08]: In response to those questions,
I thought about that and I realized that
[SPEAKER_08]: there's an analogy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, people want to be able to have,
well, one of the recommendations is if you
[SPEAKER_08]: can, stay out of the commodity market
because it really is hard to compete in
[SPEAKER_08]: these economies of scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: Directed to the small farmers who still
don't want to be sued for patent
[SPEAKER_08]: infringement for some of the very broad
patents that have issued, the analogy that
[SPEAKER_08]: I drew from that is that in the
electronics industry, we all hear about
[SPEAKER_08]: the big lawsuits because they're really,
really big, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_08]: there are companies that coexist by
licensing their technology to each other
[SPEAKER_08]: and just agreeing not to sue each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they could sue each other into
oblivion, they could be in court every
[SPEAKER_08]: day.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason they breach these agreements is
because both parties have some patents
[SPEAKER_08]: that the other party might infringe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of just getting stuck in patent
litigation, they cross-license each other
[SPEAKER_08]: and they coexist.
[SPEAKER_08]: My suggestion for the cannabis industry
and to protect the small farmer is to
[SPEAKER_08]: establish some pools of patents and a
mutual defense organization of some sort
[SPEAKER_08]: where anyone who gets sued for patent
infringement can tap into this pool of all
[SPEAKER_08]: their colleagues in that pool,
the small farmers, the small growers,
[SPEAKER_08]: small breeders, and any patent that any of
them owns that might be useful in a
[SPEAKER_08]: counter suit or to assert against this
party that's threatened or has actually
[SPEAKER_08]: filed a patent infringement case.
[SPEAKER_08]: That whole community's patent pool can be
tapped into to try to counter balance the
[SPEAKER_08]: force of these really big companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some challenges with that,
but I do think it's viable and I and some
[SPEAKER_08]: other people who care about this are
working on putting this very thing
[SPEAKER_08]: together.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a fund for patent defense so
that the small player isn't completely
[SPEAKER_08]: outgunned in terms of firepower in
mounting a defense and challenging the
[SPEAKER_08]: validity of an overbroad patent as well as
having a pool of other people's patents
[SPEAKER_08]: that they can draw on in a counter suit.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's still a lot to be done with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing that any one person or law
firm will do on its own, but it is
[SPEAKER_08]: something I believe needs to be done so
that the community of small farmers and
[SPEAKER_08]: traditional players in the industry really
have a chance to stand their ground in the
[SPEAKER_08]: face of some very big, very aggressive
patenting strategies.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to open up the microphones for
questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: While folks are collecting their thoughts
on questions there, I did have a question,
[SPEAKER_09]: at least for Janine, on are there cases in
the past where people have protected
[SPEAKER_09]: champagne or protected Appalachian
branding in the past, and how have those
[SPEAKER_09]: traditionally been litigated?
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, they're not litigated through
any kind of intellectual property court.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're litigated probably more through
state law.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't actually know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to hear more about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because the designation is really
codified and issued by the regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: authority, that really is then the
opportunity to bring forward claims of
[SPEAKER_03]: fraud.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of how it's driven is really by
producers, trade associations,
[SPEAKER_03]: syndicates in France is what they're
called.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an element of self-pleasing and
then an authority with which to bring your
[SPEAKER_03]: claim forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's for the designation to be
evaluated with respect to standards
[SPEAKER_03]: adherement.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really generally how the
enforcement works with an Appalachian
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I see a question from Brett.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got two brief questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first rides the coattails of Kevin's
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear a lot about geographic GI.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget the acronym there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear allusions to science.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are we with any kind of standard
protocol for looking at what would
[SPEAKER_06]: determine what you're... Because what I'm
hearing is essentially you're talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about having essentially a biological
marker of epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you using for that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the second question is, with respect
to the idea of a patent pool, what about
[SPEAKER_06]: in the other event where we're not looking
where there's a clear patent infringement
[SPEAKER_06]: case and where a patent defense fund could
be leveraged really for the benefit of the
[SPEAKER_06]: infringer?
[SPEAKER_06]: Could there be a back fire type situation
there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll attempt to hit your first question
and then hand it to probably Dale for the
[SPEAKER_09]: IP side of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: One way of perhaps trying to register
where your genetics are is you can get DNA
[SPEAKER_09]: sequence information fairly cheaply now
from a plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then if you can demonstrate, a lot of
photographs on phones have geo tags
[SPEAKER_09]: embedded inside the metadata of the image.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can attach that image with the
geographic timestamp of it, if you will,
[SPEAKER_09]: with the sequence information on some type
of blockchain to prove, hey, this was
[SPEAKER_09]: grown in a particular appellation,
there's perhaps ways of circulating that
[SPEAKER_09]: information so that it's immutable and
it's on a distributed public ledger that
[SPEAKER_09]: nobody can change.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in terms of the second question on
patents, I'm going to pass it over to...
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let you wrap that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope this is responsive to your
question.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure that I got the full question.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'd like to rephrase it, you could or
I can just dive in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you are.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really bright up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The question was, in a case where someone
in this patent pool is maliciously trying
[SPEAKER_08]: to infringe a valid patent, would it
backfire?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do believe so.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you'd have to have exceptions.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't have bad faith infringement of a
valid patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is really about maybe two things,
at least one.
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been... I don't want to get too
jargony or anything, but to give you maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: hopefully the one minute version of patent
examination.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you apply for a patent, the patent
examiner's job is to look at what you've
[SPEAKER_08]: claimed and find every reason that they
can for rejecting it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That really is their job.
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of protects the public from
granting unduly broad monopolies.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way they do that in biotech or
electronics or airplane engines or
[SPEAKER_08]: anything is they look on this vast body of
prior academic literature, prior patent
[SPEAKER_08]: literature, and they can find things that
come pretty close to what someone is
[SPEAKER_08]: claiming to have invented.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they find something that's dead on
exactly the same, they'll give a rejection
[SPEAKER_08]: for lack of novelty.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's just pretty close, maybe what
they're claiming is a trivial modification
[SPEAKER_08]: over what came before, they'll give it a
rejection for obviousness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, now put yourself in the space of
you're a cannabis patent examiner,
[SPEAKER_08]: and this is an industry that has a lot of
prior commercial activity, but basically
[SPEAKER_08]: no significant prior literature in terms
of prior patents or prior academic
[SPEAKER_08]: research, notwithstanding the beautiful
work we've heard spoken about today.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is such a small number of
publications compared with the hundreds of
[SPEAKER_08]: thousands or millions of publications in
some other industries.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're pretty focused, fantastic,
but they're pretty focused.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if someone applies for a patent in the
cannabis space, the examiner really is
[SPEAKER_08]: flying in the dark.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have the tools in the
literature to assess really whether this
[SPEAKER_08]: claimed invention is new or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the result is that arguably there have
been some patents that have been granted
[SPEAKER_08]: that have been unduly broad and that place
a burden on the industry because they
[SPEAKER_08]: really cover things that are not new.
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's the case, and I'm not here
giving a legal opinion, but if that's the
[SPEAKER_08]: case, the community itself is the best
source of this so-called prior art.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll be able to come, especially if
they consider themselves a mutual defense
[SPEAKER_08]: organization of some sort, they'll be able
to come forward with their own evidence
[SPEAKER_08]: that this or that chemo type has been
around for a long time and wasn't really
[SPEAKER_08]: new when this particular patent was filed.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just one example.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I would never want to be part of
something that would defend a bad faith
[SPEAKER_08]: infringer of a valid patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is really about patents either that
are over broad and therefore invalid,
[SPEAKER_08]: that cover things that are not new or that
are obvious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or in some cases, it can be that someone
does develop something great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's say somebody comes up with
technology to make all cannabis mildew
[SPEAKER_08]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's going to want to have that
access to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this kind of patent pool might be able
to negotiate a group license in a way that
[SPEAKER_08]: wouldn't be available to any individual
member of that pool.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the case of a genuine invention that
has valid patent rights, there can still
[SPEAKER_08]: be a place for this kind of a pool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope we can make it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question in particular for
Christian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that answered?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that OK if I go forward?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I come from the food processing and the
agriculture background.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were very involved in using
technology that came from Europe that was
[SPEAKER_04]: regarding traceability and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could use a barcode and know who grew
your meat, what medicine they have,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the United States was much farther
behind in giving that accessibility to the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer because of the EU and the
differences of where the sources were
[SPEAKER_04]: coming in, all the things you guys are
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm in the cannabis sector in both
the hemp side and on the THC side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking for that type of ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm understanding now that the
blockchain technology would give even a
[SPEAKER_04]: greater depth of traceability and chain of
command.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question is, is that something that
I've been trying to shop for this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something that I can actually go
out and get the right stuff for the part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the chain of command or the blockchain?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how would I attain that and use
that in my business?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I should repeat the answer you
gave earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come talk to me afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of commercial
operations that provide these services
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all innovators in this room,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're the pioneer, the blockchain
space is also relatively new to a new
[SPEAKER_00]: 10-year-old industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governments, companies, entrepreneurs are
all trying to figure out, how do I tap
[SPEAKER_00]: into the very few new things that
blockchains do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blockchain is not the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is part of the solution for specific
reasons, traceability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kevin said it earlier, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a notarization of that traceability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can trace with a private database.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you trust a company that owns a
database, it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is, what if you don't
trust Monsanto's words?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where that traceability can be
improved with these more open network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you've got to be careful with
how these words are interpreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open does not mean there's no room for
commercial, legal, governmental,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have spoken specifically about
food to the Canadian Food Inspection
[SPEAKER_00]: Agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were asking, Walmart,
the Loblaws, some big fishery in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we need better traceability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next time there's a food poison,
a food event, we can figure out where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: from quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the conversation,
all these companies were all freaked out
[SPEAKER_00]: about how much it was going to cost them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were telling the Canadian
government, sorry, we can't do this
[SPEAKER_00]: without help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they say, hey, Christian,
maybe blockchain can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, blockchain's not going to solve
a $100 million problem, but it is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be part of the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the solution that it brings is better
transparency and better notarization of
[SPEAKER_00]: the information that you're viewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it be conned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you cheat on the blockchain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the product is not information,
in this case, the product is a cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it is a physical product, there can be
a lie about the information put on the
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of aspect to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a panacea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at sites like Canapedia,
you can start small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start with a scan at the farm and
a scan at the dispensary and maybe a scan
[SPEAKER_00]: of an employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, all of this can be done very
privately and in private systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're trying to demonstrate
that, no, this is the farm that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: there for four generations and they've
been growing a good cannabis for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to differentiate your product,
that's where I think these more public
[SPEAKER_00]: networks like blockchain systems can help.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I'll just add to that real
quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was at an AOAC meeting recently where
Frank Giannis, who's high up at the FDA,
[SPEAKER_09]: was commenting on how it was taking them
60 days to track dirty product,
[SPEAKER_09]: like bad mangoes or something,
throughout the food chain that they
[SPEAKER_09]: currently have.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they got on board with a particular
blockchain project known as Hyperledger,
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm not necessarily endorsing that as
the particular solution here, but they
[SPEAKER_09]: demonstrated they could get that 62 days
down to 60 days.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's six seconds once they had
everything bar-coded seed to sale as an
[SPEAKER_09]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they only had that running in one
particular food and obviously that has to
[SPEAKER_09]: get expanded to all foods and there's a
lot of building and engineering that needs
[SPEAKER_09]: to go on to scale this to multiple other
industries.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's happening at the FDA level where
they want blockchains on everything and
[SPEAKER_09]: they want genetic signatures on everything
so they can trace outbreaks at a much more
[SPEAKER_09]: rapid clip.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the next question might be coming
from over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're having a hard time seeing people.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we're responding to you in the wrong
direction, don't take offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a cyber question.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background is in physical security,
so dealing with physical access control
[SPEAKER_01]: video cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our solutions have been moving
towards the secure hosted phase,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's up in the cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know with Canada and the Patriot Act,
there's a lot of rules where if we work
[SPEAKER_01]: with any of our Canadian companies,
it has to be servers that are within
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada's borders outside of the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question for cannabis is because it's
not federally legalized, do we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: consider where is that information stored?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if my organization is in
with this state, California, does my
[SPEAKER_01]: information have to physically reside in
California?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we deal with that secure hosted?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a quick comment on the
decentralized network protocols,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is my specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a problem governments are struggling
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blockchain came about and now you can move
more than $10,000 across borders without
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governments didn't like that, and that's
why they're trying to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: legally categorize these new information
networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, maybe it's a good thing that
the cost of transaction is being reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of storing information in a
specific place on planet Earth should not
[SPEAKER_00]: be relevant anymore in the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have all sorts of ways to store
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can store information in DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: These old approaches are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changing slowly, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of legalization and creation of
zonings and cultivars, identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take time, but I think these kind of
requirements will be relaxed over time
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because they're becoming,
I don't want to say obsolete, but
[SPEAKER_00]: obsolete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, so just from a legal standpoint,
you don't see worry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a lawyer, so I'm always worried
about legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I call my lawyer when I need a
lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a danger there that I don't have a
solution for it, but the information will
[SPEAKER_00]: not stay on a database in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a lawyer, but my reaction to that
would be that the information itself isn't
[SPEAKER_05]: technically in violation of the Controlled
Substance Act, though that information
[SPEAKER_05]: could be used in prosecution if activities
were violating the Controlled Substance
[SPEAKER_05]: Act.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as I know, the information itself
isn't the crime, it's only evidence of a
[SPEAKER_05]: crime, potentially.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're worried that if the geotag to
demonstrate your appellation points to
[SPEAKER_09]: your house, that might be a bad idea?
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Jason.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm with OCANA.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a patent question.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was reading last week that Charlotte's
Web got approved for a 0.27 THC level on
[SPEAKER_10]: CBD hemp strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're supposedly going to get
approved for a utility patent here in the
[SPEAKER_10]: next few months.
[SPEAKER_10]: What does that mean exactly, the 0.27?
[SPEAKER_10]: I might have a follow-up question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I was interviewed about this
very thing by at least a couple of
[SPEAKER_08]: reporters a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is big news.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the biggest concern arises from
people not having clarity about what this
[SPEAKER_08]: actually covers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at least the plant patent that I
looked at, and it was the topic of the
[SPEAKER_08]: questions I addressed a couple of weeks
ago, at least that plant patent is truly a
[SPEAKER_08]: plant patent, which means the only thing
it protects is if someone makes clonal
[SPEAKER_08]: copies of that exact genotype.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so then the question is, well,
why would they do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be that, and this is all,
why would they choose to get that kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: patent?
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're in the seed business,
then the only reason they would want to
[SPEAKER_08]: get that kind of plant patent is to
protect the parent from being copied
[SPEAKER_08]: without permission.
[SPEAKER_08]: They may be selling clones.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you think, wow, why would you sell
clones for hemp when you've got a farm it
[SPEAKER_08]: on such scale?
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that one of the biggest problems in
hemp is if your THC level goes above 0.3,
[SPEAKER_08]: you've got a big problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so maybe this is so stable,
so locked in at 0.27 or lower,
[SPEAKER_08]: that it has enough value that people would
farm this using clones.
[SPEAKER_08]: But bottom line is, if it's a plant
patent, it will never protect more than
[SPEAKER_08]: one genotype.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's a utility patent, you have to look
at the way it's claimed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a utility patent would never be able
to claim every kind of hemp that is below
[SPEAKER_08]: 0.3, because those aren't new.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it could claim a particular cultivar
that is the subject of a seed deposit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that if you have something that
matches this cultivar and this seed
[SPEAKER_08]: deposit, then you would be infringing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to add one thing to that as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also important to know that plant
patents only cost about $2,500 to file.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a really tiny insurance policy
for someone to protect against employees
[SPEAKER_09]: running out the back door with cuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they may have viewed that in light
of maybe security cameras and been like,
[SPEAKER_09]: this is a good thing to add on so that if
anyone grabs a cut, they know that we've
[SPEAKER_09]: got a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can then come after them with.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a huge cost next to a utility
patent, which might be 10 times more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it can be as low as $2,500 to file
it, to get it all the way through the
[SPEAKER_08]: patent offices more.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's still around $10,000,
$10,000 to $12,000 usually is the average.
[SPEAKER_10]: So at 0.27, they don't own every patent?
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank
[SPEAKER_02]: you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many questions, so little time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we speak to hemp pollen collection
storage for a moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: My big quandary here is, I know the data
sets are somewhere, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: practically impossible to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, what would be the moisture
content in fresh hemp pollen?
[SPEAKER_02]: How far do we have to and how safely can
we dehydrate that down before we do,
[SPEAKER_02]: not really long term, but say for a long
time, a few months, minus 50 C storage in
[SPEAKER_02]: that pollen without degrading it or
rupturing the capsules so that it's ready
[SPEAKER_02]: for pollination when our plants are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what stage do we have to
re-moisturize that pollen before we apply
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen some photos that shows that
the pistol structure itself is capable of
[SPEAKER_02]: re-moisturizing the pollen as it produces
its tube to insert its DNA package.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got a lot of money put in this,
and we don't want to try to be shooting it
[SPEAKER_02]: in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to leave that to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any of the specifics at hand
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know that there are some published
studies that address the issue of pollen
[SPEAKER_05]: saving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from personal experience, low tech,
not doing any scientific studies,
[SPEAKER_05]: I leave my pollen out for two weeks to
dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I put it into refrigerated
storage with a desiccant, and I leave it
[SPEAKER_05]: in my fridge for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've had viable pollen up to 12 months
after I've stored it in that fashion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not at all scientific or what you're
asking, but I do know that the data is out
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe I have some PDFs that I
could share afterwards with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, because the industry is
somewhat beyond our old styles of doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of information, like this
particular experience, practice that you
[SPEAKER_00]: do about the pollen, which I know nothing
about, so I won't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the information that you have,
which was a question, is really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect you to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another farmer, producer that
needs to know what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where a little excitement may
be where, beyond just traceability,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we want to really engage some of the
new dynamics with these peer-to-peer
[SPEAKER_00]: networks, that information, you can put up
for sale on these networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much that was worth,
but some of it is fractional, fraction
[SPEAKER_00]: microtransactions, fractions of pennies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was the cannabis cultivated or the
harvest date?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little piece of information that
a lot of people will want to know down the
[SPEAKER_00]: supply line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy doing the oil, the guy selling the
oil, the customer buying the thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's going to want to know the
cultivar and a bunch of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the extent where that information makes
the practice better, the farmer should
[SPEAKER_00]: have a forum to be able to brag about it
in order to raise the value of their brand
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can notarize that on the
network, then that becomes money,
[SPEAKER_00]: new money, a new stream of information
that doesn't come from the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes from the information about the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis that you've been growing,
that you can now sell.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to reinforce that topic
because there's asymmetric information all
[SPEAKER_09]: over the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever you find people who can share
like this, there's value that's created.
[SPEAKER_09]: And from our perspective, we would pay
value or money, make microtransactions,
[SPEAKER_09]: what have you, for people that supplied us
with chemotypes in addition to their
[SPEAKER_09]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So instead of us trying to collect that
stuff and harvest it on you and sell it to
[SPEAKER_09]: somebody else, we'd actually love to be
able to have a blockchain that could give
[SPEAKER_09]: people credits if the strain they had in
Canapedia was really popular or sold a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: or had a chemotype and we could give them
more frequent flyer miles to use more
[SPEAKER_09]: sequencing or use more of our products if
we could actually capture some of that
[SPEAKER_09]: information and trade it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So even though you might think a terpene
profile on a plant is meaningless and not
[SPEAKER_09]: worth any value, it's valuable to other
people who don't have access to that
[SPEAKER_09]: information.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they could get on a network that
could share it, it would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have time for one more question
over there before lunch breaks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have a question for Dale and then
a brief comment that and I can meet with
[SPEAKER_07]: you afterwards on with Janine and Trevor
on the whole GI and Appalachian thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dale, thank you, by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had the pleasure of meeting with you in
Oregon and thanks for outlining the
[SPEAKER_07]: difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've answered some of my questions
already.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basic outline of plant patent versus
utility patent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you take a moment and just dive into
the PDP and why it's good for hemp?
[SPEAKER_07]: You kind of ran through that kind of
quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, what does that acronym mean
again?
[SPEAKER_08]: Plant Variety Protection.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plant what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Plant Variety Protection.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, PVP.
[SPEAKER_08]: PVP.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't enunciate well.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so the USDA, to put a little bit of
historical context on it, the Congress
[SPEAKER_08]: passed the Plant Patent Act in I think
about the 1930s, but for some crazy
[SPEAKER_08]: reason, it only covered asexually
propagated plants, trees, vines,
[SPEAKER_08]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It did not cover seed propagated plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Later on, in about the 60s, there was a
worldwide movement for protection of plant
[SPEAKER_08]: breeder's rights or for establishment of
plant breeder's rights and something
[SPEAKER_08]: called UPOV was created, which is a French
acronym that basically means the Union for
[SPEAKER_08]: Protection of Plant Varieties and or New
Varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: And eventually the US joined UPOV in gosh,
70s, I think, maybe 80s, doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the next millennium anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in joining UPOV, the US limited its
protection.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unlike the rest of the world, it limited
its protection just to seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was to kind of fill the gap
created by the Plant Patent Statute.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was only last December that that gap
was or that that limitation was removed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now the USDA PVP can protect asexually
propagated varieties, although that's only
[SPEAKER_08]: theoretical for now because the Plant
Variety Protection Office hasn't yet
[SPEAKER_08]: figured out how to handle the deposits of
asexually propagated plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeds are one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting whole plants or some kind of
tissue culture or something, that's
[SPEAKER_08]: another thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a whole big administrative challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the main differences are between PVP
and a utility patent on a plant that would
[SPEAKER_08]: claim a seed is that plant variety
protection, as it currently exists in
[SPEAKER_08]: usable ways, you can use it for hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to make a deposit of about 3,000
seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's exactly 3,000 seeds to be
precise.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have to pay quite a few fees,
but the examination process is quite
[SPEAKER_08]: different from the US patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'd say the biggest differences
are that plant variety protection,
[SPEAKER_08]: the whole UPOV system, has two exemptions.
[SPEAKER_08]: That don't apply to utility patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: One is called the Breeders' Exemption,
which means that it is not an infringement
[SPEAKER_08]: of a Plant Variety Protection Certificate
to use a protected variety in breeding
[SPEAKER_08]: other varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that also called Breeders' Rights?
[SPEAKER_08]: Breeders' Rights, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, sometimes when they talk about
Breeders' Rights, they talk about the
[SPEAKER_08]: rights that accrue to the owner of that
registration.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this is specifically on the PVP.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then the other exemption is the
Farmers' Exemption.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which means that a farmer who buys a
registered seed can save enough seed to
[SPEAKER_08]: replant the same acreage season after
season, and that that's not an
[SPEAKER_08]: infringement.
[SPEAKER_08]: The farmer's not allowed under that
exemption to sell the seed or to make more
[SPEAKER_08]: seed than enough to replant that field or
that acreage.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's an affirmative right that is
carved out of the Plant Variety Protection
[SPEAKER_08]: Act that doesn't have an analogy in a US
utility patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to have the maximum control
over how people use the seeds that you
[SPEAKER_08]: sell, the right way to do that would be
with a US utility patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can talk a lot more, though,
after.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and there's a lot more.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just a comment, because one of the
Oregonians, Oregon is really taking a lead
[SPEAKER_07]: in certified hemp seed right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been certifying seed in Oregon for
over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Largest producer of grass seed on planet
Earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're pretty far ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm actually working on that state
board with a couple other breeders.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the comment I wanted to make in
another organization I'm in, this is for
[SPEAKER_07]: Janine and Trevor, this is the,
like an AVA, you called it a GI or an
[SPEAKER_07]: Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one thing that I don't hear talked
about sometimes, I think is a weakness in
[SPEAKER_07]: that for high-end cannabis, is number one,
it's an annual plant, so it's not the same
[SPEAKER_07]: as a vine that's going to get the terroir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, we had a guy, a geologist from
OSU, which is our premier ag school in
[SPEAKER_07]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the UC Davis of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he came down and wanted to investigate
bringing forward exactly what you guys are
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about, the GI, the Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he gave clones to a lot of people
through our Sungrown Growers Guild.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the one thing that people hadn't
thought about is most high-end cannabis is
[SPEAKER_07]: not grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: First, annual plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, often not grown in native
soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grown in big bags of imported soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're not going to get the terroir,
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's a good play for us as an
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't necessarily require an answer
from you at this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to take any more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's a longer play,
the Appalachian, versus protecting our
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics through other means.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be more effective now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something we have to think
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not grown in native soil,
by and large.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are excellent points.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to respond briefly.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are geographic indication
protections for annuals and also products
[SPEAKER_03]: in general, not just crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to your second point, which is an
excellent one with respect to terroir and
[SPEAKER_03]: native soil, one of the things our
organization is looking at from a research
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective is the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we feel like that is an array that
creates a bridge between the native soil
[SPEAKER_03]: and essentially the native microbiome of
the region that can populate and integrate
[SPEAKER_03]: with soil mediums to such an extent that
there is that localized influence,
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly with respect to the exudate
relationship and then the metabolomic
[SPEAKER_03]: expression of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's something we're really
specifically looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: With respect to how this might be relevant
for cannabis as an annual that is
[SPEAKER_03]: frequently cultivated in aggregate soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to speak more with you after
the panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're going to wrap this up so
folks can get some lunch before it
[SPEAKER_09]: disappears.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to thank all the panelists
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
