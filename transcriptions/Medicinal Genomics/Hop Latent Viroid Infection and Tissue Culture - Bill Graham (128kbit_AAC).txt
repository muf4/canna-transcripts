[SPEAKER_01]: That the plant typically gets infected,
it goes down to the roots, stays there for
[SPEAKER_01]: a little while, and then it kind of
proliferates throughout the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the idea being that like,
you're trying to catch those tips before
[SPEAKER_01]: the viroid has had a chance to get there,
and then you're kind of constantly- It
[SPEAKER_01]: actually moves down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if it's in those limbs,
some of it moves down, the down tends to
[SPEAKER_00]: go down and stay down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could, of course, carry back up because
the xylem, which will go back up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: limbs, is especially active during- It's
active early on for water and nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, it's the primary carrier for
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: In flowering, especially in cannabis,
it gets interesting because we have a new
[SPEAKER_00]: shunt, and that is that stored sugar,
the wood, and carbohydrates we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about in the roots and stems, begins to
mobilize again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll take complex carbohydrates and
turn into the simple sugars again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and start sending those up the xylem,
which is when we suspect that the viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be carried up as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sugar is relatively large
organisms, it's obviously metabolically
[SPEAKER_00]: driven, and we suspect that viroid is
involved somewhere in gumming up the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first of all, we're doing it in veg
when those things would not be moving
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two is just that all that growth is
coming from the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like trying to chase a rocket if
you're in its burn stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that very tip growth yesterday is
now centimeters or inches higher tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And considering we're talking about things
that are just shared passively,
[SPEAKER_00]: cell to cell, and when you get up into
growth that high, and then those brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular tissues, they are often missed,
is how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the testing comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've done this for a while,
and we were sending in testing from TIPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're getting so much more negative
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's funny is you guys, as a testing
agency, were saying, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should either mix all of those samples
together, or let's go for these other
[SPEAKER_00]: high-concentrated tissues, which is great,
again, for identifying the presence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost go ahead and say it's
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it wasn't viroid, it's something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we start doing it off of TIPS,
there is the greater likelihood that
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming the plant had viroid in it at
all, that we're using material that's so
[SPEAKER_00]: new, and it's grown so vigorously that it
is viroid-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we take that cutting with clean
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the part about this I hadn't
mentioned is that to take that top off,
[SPEAKER_00]: your hands have been cleaned in bleach
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tools have been cleaned in bleach
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a vinyl apron with bleachy
sponges in it and three sets of tools and
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves so that I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, from talking to Zamir,
he said, yes, viroid can live in bleach as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, but not well and not for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the best we have is to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to ask for trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do our best to eliminate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll be cleaning the plant,
cleaning the tools, and then taking
[SPEAKER_00]: another cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
Let's do this.
