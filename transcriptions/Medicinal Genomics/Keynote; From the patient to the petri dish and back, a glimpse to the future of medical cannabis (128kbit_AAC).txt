[SPEAKER_01]: Hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually quite impressive audience after
lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that I would come if I would
instead of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially which I gave this talk a year
ago and science not move so fast
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope we have a little bit new
audience and I won't be too boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want in this talk, in this hour that
I have, to show you how I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis will be in five years
from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my opinion and my father said that if
you argue with somebody 50% that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be that I'm wrong but that's
how I see it and I want to show it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way of two specific research that we did
in the lab in the last two years and every
[SPEAKER_01]: one of them I think we take the cannabis,
the medical cannabis to a different angle
[SPEAKER_01]: and think to my opinion we will see two
different sides of the coin in few years
[SPEAKER_01]: of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with... This is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will start with a very short
introduction but I think this introduction
[SPEAKER_01]: actually I built it for this conference a
year ago as that was my talk but today I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to show it as an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis plant is amazing plant,
is a unique plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually Rafi spoke this morning and said
that and talk about addiction and people
[SPEAKER_01]: said that there is no addiction to
cannabis but I think it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anyone that started to work
with this plant and not become addicted to
[SPEAKER_01]: his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a unique plant, it's a crazy plant
that affect our body in many, many ways
[SPEAKER_01]: and when I started to work on cannabis and
I read that it's doing everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing pain, increase appetite,
change your mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't believe it, it didn't make sense
to me but four years later when I know how
[SPEAKER_01]: it's affecting the endocrine and
cannabinoid system I understand why it's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our body and I'm sure everybody here
knows about it and also Rafi spoke about
[SPEAKER_01]: it so I won't mention it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our body produce the same compounds,
very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually they are not so similar,
the three dimension structure is similar
[SPEAKER_01]: but they are doing similar effects in our
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoid system, it's a
regulation system, it's a homostatic
[SPEAKER_01]: system, it's a balancing outer system but
it's actually involved in almost every
[SPEAKER_01]: system in our body and balancing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always giving the same example so I'm
sorry about that but it's the most clear
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That when we move near a barbecue and we
smell the barbecue, we smell small
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules entering to our nose,
going to our olfactory system,
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling to a neuron that produce
specific endocannabinoid that will bind
[SPEAKER_01]: specific neurons that will produce
specific signals to our liver and there is
[SPEAKER_01]: an insulin, sorry to our pancreas would
create insulin and there is feedback loop
[SPEAKER_01]: that increase our appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the endocannabinoid system so
it's not surprise that cannabis increase
[SPEAKER_01]: in our appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the endocannabinoid system,
it's actually a system that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling between cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: One cell is send a signal, send a message
to another cell and this message is a real
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a compound, it's a secondary
metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it cannabinoids in the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these cannabinoids, these chemical
compounds, do I have a pointer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, these endocannabinoids will release
from one cell and bind a protein that will
[SPEAKER_01]: know how to read this message and to
signal to the cell to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's involving so many system and affect
our body regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's quite clear to everybody that
sit in the audience about this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just coming from Baltimore last week
from the NIH, one of the people that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobel Prize scientist and I won't mention
his name because the story that I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I show this and talk about the
endocannabinoid system, he said,
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I learned medicine and I'm a
scientist, I have a Nobel.
[SPEAKER_01]: No way there is a system that I never
heard about.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, there are more than 3,000 papers
about this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, there is ligand, there is
receptors, this is a system, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had this argue, it took me 15
minutes stopping my talk to explain that
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a system in our body that is
working to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This system has major two compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the ligand and there is the
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly we are showing these two receptors,
but there is other many receptors that are
[SPEAKER_01]: playing a role in the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are GPR55, GPR3 and the TRPV family
and more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing bioinformatics,
we can find around 28 different receptors
[SPEAKER_01]: that participate in the endocannabinoid
action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we call them endocannabinoid receptors?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does a part of the endocannabinoid system
that regulates the system binding
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide to AG, other endocannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're taking a blood sample and we
check how many ligands, how many messages
[SPEAKER_01]: like that our body produce, we can analyze
under up to 150 endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids like or enzymes that
participate in this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 150 compounds that participate in this
action, we call it endocannabidome like
[SPEAKER_01]: proteome or metabolome because it's so
wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very, very complicated system in
the body in very tight regulation that's
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling and balancing other mechanism
and system in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis plant is producing similar
compounds, the fetocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the THC and other compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can analyze at least 10 different
families of fetocannabinoids in the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and altogether over than 140
fetocannabinoids from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this cannabis is just mimic the action
that is native to our body, natural to our
[SPEAKER_01]: body instead of getting an out and the
signals from the output surrounding like a
[SPEAKER_01]: pain or like a smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will bind the receptor and will send a
signal as we smell a barbecue now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing a mess here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we smell the barbecue and the same
signal will enter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rafi started to talk about the
entourage effect, which in the past people
[SPEAKER_01]: showed and we know it from the patient
Rafi have few papers about that showing
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you're taking one compound,
it's not working as good as the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason or the way it's act usually
that a ligand and a receptor are like a
[SPEAKER_01]: lock and a key.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it the lock and a key principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need a one molecule that will fit
to the receptors in order to operate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually if you have a key that is
very similar to the keys that operate but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a little bit different, it will
usually will enter the lock but will stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it agonist and antagonist or
inhibitors and activators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one molecule can activate the receptors
and the other one can block it even though
[SPEAKER_01]: they looked extremely, extremely similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is biology, basic biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the same in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we adjust cannabis, we're not
entering one compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many compounds will enter our body and
will bind the receptors on the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I showed you that there is
many receptors and there are many
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, every one of them will bind
different receptors and send a different
[SPEAKER_01]: signal to the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're getting a very complicated
action.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, this is a major part of the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the reason that one compound is
not acting as the whole extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a complicated system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it synergism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a synergism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a complicated system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know already, at least from our
epilepsy work, that sometimes there are
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, as I showed you, that blocking
the receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be in the same extract,
a compound that blocking the receptors and
[SPEAKER_01]: a compound that activating the receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a competition between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have at least one strain in Israel
that when I'm giving to the mice,
[SPEAKER_01]: it should reduce seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of high CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also CBDV.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the integrators that I think will
block the seizures of the mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did, we separated to two parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 compounds here, 50 compounds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one part is working very well and
the other part is not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put them together, it's not working
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in this side, there is something
that inhibiting the action.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes we get a different action,
not just because there is more compound
[SPEAKER_01]: that activating, but also there is things
that blocking or changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we're talking about very
complicated machinery in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we started to do research four
years ago, we started in asking what is
[SPEAKER_01]: the action anti-cancer properties of
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Israel, we have many, many patients,
almost 20,000 cancer patients that getting
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are getting cannabis as
palliative care, as improving quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of the chemotherapy that getting
cannabis to reduce nausea, to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: appetite, to reduce pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our question was whether cannabis can
have effect on the real tumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I told you, there is many types of
cannabis and every one of them have many
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cancer, it's a given name to hundreds
of different diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in breast cancer, I'm familiar with
more than 40 types of breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how to start?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure that everyone that know me
saw these images already, so I will do it
[SPEAKER_01]: fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking the cancer cells that we are
growing in a plate, in a plate like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is between 3 million to 10 million
cells depend on the type of the cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are creating extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're extracting the active compound from
the cannabis and we're adding to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look on colon cancer,
we see every dot here is a cancer cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're adding the cannabis extract number
one and it's kill all the colon cancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're adding extract number two,
we saw the same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We add extract number three and it didn't
affect the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the same thing with breast cancer
and we saw very similar effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a prostate cancer and now the one
that killed the colon cancer and the
[SPEAKER_01]: breast cancer didn't affect the prostate
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing with the second one,
but the third one that didn't affect the
[SPEAKER_01]: colon, didn't affect the breast,
now killing the prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we took colon cells that are not
cancerose, the cannabis didn't affect them
[SPEAKER_01]: in that amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ask ourselves, okay, what is doing
this effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: We read five compounds four years ago and
we saw that actually extract number two
[SPEAKER_01]: and extract number three are not different
on the main five phyto-cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not surprising, I already showed
you that there is many cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: phyto-cannabinoids from the plant,
but also there is terpenoids and there is
[SPEAKER_01]: phyto-cannabinoids and flavonoids all
together around 500 active compounds in
[SPEAKER_01]: the extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't look just on five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're taking 20 of these strains
that we have, we have over the 900
[SPEAKER_01]: different genetics in my lab today.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're taking 20 of them and you
measure the phyto-cannabinoids and we
[SPEAKER_01]: create a system to do that, a method to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you see here, it's the different
phyto-cannabinoids and here are every
[SPEAKER_01]: line, it's a different gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genetic of cannabis and you see when
it's dark, the meaning that these
[SPEAKER_01]: phyto-cannabinoids highly express here,
when it's white, the meaning it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: expressing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the differences between
the genetic, how much the active compound,
[SPEAKER_01]: the phyto-cannabinoids are different
between different genetics of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, it's not surprising that one
is killing and the other is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I told you that it's probably
not a CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we want to measure it, we can do
high throughput screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can take a machine that can take fast
images from the plate and I won't go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the details and we can put markers,
fluorescent markers and we'll just say
[SPEAKER_01]: that every time that the cell is blue,
the meaning is alive and every time that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's red, the meaning is going through
apoptosis and is dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see the control is blue,
these strains kill the cells very fast and
[SPEAKER_01]: these strains not affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go to the stats, every color here is
a different genetics, different strain of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we take four micrograms per ml,
you can see that there is few strains that
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't affect these melanoma cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is few strains that kill 50% and few
strains that were very efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very similar to what I showed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we align these strains by the amount of
CBD and THC, we see that there is no
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation between the amount of THC and
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are taking one strain that killed
70% of these cells and we're extracting,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're purifying the THC and the CBD and we
put them together on these cells,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if we put 20 times more of these CBD
and THC on these cells, it's not affecting
[SPEAKER_01]: the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not the THC and CBD or it's not
the THC and CBD alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's the entourage, maybe we need
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going now and look on different
types of cancer, we see the same problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different types of cancer will act
differently, even though it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic of the cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look on now couples.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two, just a moment here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two are, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two are melanoma cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two are colon cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that in these colon cancer,
there is few extracts that are very
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient to kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on these colon cancer, we screened
over than 800 different extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them affect the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even in the same cancer, we have a huge
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can say, hey, daddy, which extract
work for colon cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which types of colon cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the mutation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which receptor are expressing on this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to know it, I don't know to fit
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how we can do the research?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go narrow, deeper and deeper and
deeper, look on what we call personal
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will take a cancer, let's say leukemia,
with a specific mutation, the specific
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will start to screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, okay, before that,
we can take all the cannabis that we have,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 900 different genetic and you can tell
the computer aligned them in group,
[SPEAKER_01]: not THC, CBD similarity, all the
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see by eye that we're getting
around five different groups of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: not by THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the compounds, all the terpenes,
cannabinoids and flavonoids, we get in
[SPEAKER_01]: groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, we can choose 10 from
here, 10 from here, 10 from here and 10
[SPEAKER_01]: from here to start screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're taking one types of cancer
with specific mutation and we started to
[SPEAKER_01]: screen on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see here, it's survivors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the line is lower, the meaning more
cells died.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is leukemia cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that most of the extract that
we use didn't affect this leukemia,
[SPEAKER_01]: but one extract was very efficient to kill
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we find something like that,
we are going after the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which receptors is bind?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the pathway that been operated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which protein is up-regulated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which protein is down-regulated?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking and we prove to ourselves
what we see is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we tried on one cell with specific
mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking the same type of cancer
without this mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that it's not affecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking other two cells with the same
mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see on them it's affecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're repeating it on other cells with the
same mutation or different mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing rescue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing back the proteins and we're
doing everything to prove ourself that the
[SPEAKER_01]: down-regulating proteins on these specific
cancer is going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're changing the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are proving ourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go deeper in the biology,
but we're doing everything to prove
[SPEAKER_01]: ourself which protein is up-regulated,
which protein down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: What change in the ER that now it's
blocking these cancer in normal cells is
[SPEAKER_01]: not doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing everything to understand
what's happened in these specific cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're done with that, we're going to
mice model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're creating these tumors, specific
tumors in these specific types of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We show that treating with this extract
reducing dramatically the size of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the start and this is a
representative image.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's leukemia, we did a bone
marrow implantation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We create the leukemia in these mice and
we change many, many parameters of these
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is leukemia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking the tumors and we see that
there is accumulation of the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: in these tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is accumulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We inject the cannabis to the belly of the
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: My patient has four legs and a tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: We inject the mice to the belly of the
mice, the cannabis, and it still
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulates on the tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which are on his back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very surprising and I cannot
explain why it's accumulate this very
[SPEAKER_01]: lipophilic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tumors are oily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we find the cannabinoids in the
tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see reduction of all the parameters and
so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now the $100 million question,
usually I would say $1 million question,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're on the cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody work for $1 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to say $1 million but they didn't
listen to me so I changed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question, why this strain is
different?
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember the group that we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going back and we take all the
strain that we have on that group and we
[SPEAKER_01]: measure them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that we were lucky in the
beginning to choose the best one that we
[SPEAKER_01]: had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though the same amount CBD,
THC, and other compounds, it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar, there is one that's working much
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do we need all the compounds,
the entourage effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need one special one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need two, five, seven?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do know that I want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my slogan to my students, I want the
minimum compounds that doing the maximum
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to reduce the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to know what are the minimum
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fractionating the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking the 100 compounds in the
extract and we're separating to four
[SPEAKER_01]: tubes, 25 in each tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: You run it on HPLC preparative and you
dissect the extract, the compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first 25 will be in the first tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second 25 on the second tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going back to the cells
and to the mice and you check them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now every color, it's a fraction of
this extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red one is the whole extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other colors, it's a fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see that just one fraction is
working as good as the whole extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will already eliminate 75% of the
compound that we don't need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going back to this fraction and
we cut it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're now left with 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 compounds, we separate five,
five, five and five and going back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on and so on until we reach in this
specific research to three cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three cannabinoids that you need the three
of them in order to get the same action as
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we purified 100% of the three
compounds, it's the same action of the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you take one of them, come out,
it's not working as good as the three of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we understand the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them binds CB1 receptors operating
them up kind of as the other one binding
[SPEAKER_01]: TRPV1, changing the calcium release.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the reason in the ER it's
signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need the three of them to bind at
least two different receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use cannabis, plant, extract,
one in just one in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel working for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: For two and a half years it's worked
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: After two and a half years, eight months
ago, my student came to me and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: Daddy, all the last experiment that I did
didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't kill the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Eli, did you try not just in the
mice, did you try the cells?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I tried, it don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're checking the extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't tell you that one of the
compounds is a unique compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even an unknown compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it 3318B.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my students, my chemists.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not thinking out of the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of killing this master killer,
Kaiser Sosa, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: 3318B, now we're all stuck with it
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one is a unique compound that you
must have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after two and a half years,
the grower changed the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Israel we change the regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind, they need to move from one
place to another place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They changed the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what they changed, the soil,
the water, the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their strain is not producing this
compound anymore and it's not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I wouldn't know, to analyze it and
to know what is missing, I would say to
[SPEAKER_01]: Eli, hey Eli, you're a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to do it somewhere else, PhD,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, life sucks, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not working that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now other students won't come to you
anymore, so you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by knowing exactly the compounds,
I can go to my database, tell to my
[SPEAKER_01]: student, oh, go and screen in all the
extracts that we have in the lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have these highly expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have the combination of any of
them in any of the strains, but I have
[SPEAKER_01]: other strains that producing this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: One phone call to the grower, I'm asking
one kilo of this strain, next day I got
[SPEAKER_01]: it, purifying this, adding it to the other
two from another extract when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the same action exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same one reducing the size of the
tumor, curing the leukemia, and this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: proof of a concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take one compound from here,
adding to here, it's working the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the three of them, it doesn't
matter where they come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the three of them, they're not a
question, but it doesn't matter where
[SPEAKER_01]: these come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these talk till now, I can show in
many, many other examples that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: working our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: In epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different strain, the same amount of CBD
and THC, 20 to one ratio five milligram
[SPEAKER_01]: per kilogram CBD to a mice to a kilogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see different extract affect
differently the mice as long as,
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go to the parameter, but I will
say that the bar is higher, the meaning
[SPEAKER_01]: it's reducing more seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same high CBD, low THC ratio 20 to one,
five milligram per kilogram, totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different action.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can show it in Alzheimer's, in epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In sleep disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just the CBD and THC ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's other compounds, it's much more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything that I showed you till now
was a very accurate scientific approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second speaker today, Dan Pierre,
he did a PhD in the same faculty that I
[SPEAKER_01]: did my PhD, so when I started he finished,
I admired him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had one of the best laboratories in
Israel, one of the best scientists in
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a privilege for us that he
started to work on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said something that is a newcomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, if it's not accurate compound
that they can't produce synthetic,
[SPEAKER_01]: who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: 51,000 patients in Israel care.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1,300 epileptic kid in Israel care,
they're not getting single compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting a whole extract which
reduce the seizures that help them to
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain the day when they're getting
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a unique situation that the
world didn't face till today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are treating hundreds of thousands of
patients not with a specific compound that
[SPEAKER_01]: we produce synthetic in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares what you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patient get it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't go to the dispenser,
you didn't spoke with the patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't get seven calls every day from
patient that taking cannabis and need to
[SPEAKER_01]: know what to take, how much, then you can
say, I can do it synthetically in the lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're working with the patient,
with the hospital, I'm participating in 14
[SPEAKER_01]: different clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't say who cares.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more than that, cannabis is a unique
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one hour already, I think 40
minutes, so I'm fine with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My time is not running.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me check just how much I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I have half an hour, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cannabis is a unique situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see the cannabis going in two
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a monster with two heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them I just showed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Accurate science, specific compounds,
binding specific receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other side, it's the cannabis that
most of us familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago, I started a clinical trial
on pain patient with Professor Elon
[SPEAKER_01]: Eisenberg, the head of the pain department
of Rambam Hospital today, the head of the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical school of the Technion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his student, he's a nurse in the
hospital, a PhD student, and we started to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow up on 2,000 pain patients,
how they react to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go to the dispensary,
you speak with the growers, and I have in
[SPEAKER_01]: my lab a database project which we are
following on many, many patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're hearing amazing stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Israel, there is just one dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mental health hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patient need to come and they get the
cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every grower, we have eight authorized
growers, will have a butcher that the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient will come to get it from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have two options, or to get it to
your home, or to come to pick it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this dispensary, I have two workers
that working and question you,
[SPEAKER_01]: the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are walking there and you speak
with the patient, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every patient tell you how he feels.
[SPEAKER_01]: How he changed his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: How he took opioids, nothing helped him,
and now he's taking cannabis and totally
[SPEAKER_01]: changed his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Israel, the medical cannabis is
different from the states of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are real patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to get cannabis for pain in
Israel, you need at least one year to be
[SPEAKER_01]: treated with other medicine under hospital
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to have chronic pain for at
least one year treated by many other
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that didn't help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just then you can get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a epileptic kid, you need at
least to try five different medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: before you can get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are kids that resistance to other
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are very severe patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are amazing stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to a Burbanel hospital and
you stick with the patient and doing once
[SPEAKER_01]: a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are amazing stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: A PTSD patient that told you how he can't
get out of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had two babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not let anyone to touch them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time that he's getting medicine,
he's getting to the hospitals because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: become a null.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the cannabis changes life.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think to yourself, why we're
giving other medicines if this is working
[SPEAKER_01]: so good?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is because we're not doing really
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not really doing what physicians
need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look just on the patient that it was a
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many patients tried and didn't work
for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is coming to the dispensary to take
cannabis every month?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the one that tried and it worked for
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is filling the questionnaire?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the one that he tried and worked for
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a real trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many tried and it didn't work for him?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many tried and it make harm for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my students that work on the bar
informatics in my lab came to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an Italian guy, very sweet guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came to me, Daddy, I know what we need to
publish.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, Saro, except on the pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, Daddy, cannabis is very,
very safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, why are you saying that,
Saro?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, if I look on all the 5,000
patients in our database, none of them
[SPEAKER_01]: tell that the cannabis made any harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, oh, this is very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saro, how many patients fill five times
the questionnaire they are filling every
[SPEAKER_01]: month?
[SPEAKER_01]: Five times the questionnaire stopped
filling.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, press the button, tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said to me, 357 patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, you know they all died,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: They filled five times and disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, cannabis is not killing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, no, no, it's not killing,
but you know that they have a bleeding in
[SPEAKER_01]: the belly and they went to the hospital
and this is the reason they stopped taking
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is not doing any harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, this is not science.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is we're deciding what will be the
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what's happened to the
patient that didn't fill the
[SPEAKER_01]: questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_01]: They disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're assuming, what we're assuming,
why they stopped if it was so good?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing science without really doing
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started to do a clinical trial on
pain patient from the moment that the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient and the physician decided to
prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're treating one year of other
medicines and after one year, Elon said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time to start cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: From that moment, we started to follow and
actually, unfortunately, it's a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very disappointing results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just 45 of the patient describing improve
of the pain and in this, it is 45% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 55 tried, said, didn't help,
I don't want anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: 45% described that it's helped them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just 45%.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that described that it's helped
them saying that it's reduced something
[SPEAKER_01]: like 25% of the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order that the medicine for pain to be
authorized to pass the threshold
[SPEAKER_01]: initially, we need to reduce more than 30%
of the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, none of the strains in
Israel, none of the patient crossed the
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, cannabis, it's not a good
medicine for pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: 45%, just 45% did help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that helped them, it didn't really
help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: In pain, there is almost 40% placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 45 is not far from the placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, I need to ask myself, and mainly I
need to ask Mikhidor that's sitting here,
[SPEAKER_01]: good friend of mine, that authorizes all
the patients in Israel, why we have almost
[SPEAKER_01]: 20,000 patients, pain patients that are
getting cannabis in Israel?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how come that you're speaking with
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're telling you that they saved their
lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not make sense, but if you're going
forward and ask the other parameters that
[SPEAKER_01]: we are asking, how it affects your
anxiety, how it affects your depression,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it affects your disability,
you see that in any one of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have an improvement, not a big one,
not the best treatment for depression,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the best treatment for anxiety,
but in all of them, we have a reduction,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look on sleep, it's improved the
sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, if you look on other medicine
that these patients are taking,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a huge drop off of the other
medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look on the opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it wouldn't help them, how come the
20,000 patients in Israel, Israel is a
[SPEAKER_01]: small country, 20,000 is like 80% of our
population, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how come that we have such a big amount
of patients that withdraw other,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it wouldn't reduce the pain,
why they're stopping taking other
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look on one important parameter,
this is the improvement of the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that the improvement is very,
very minor, but this is called
[SPEAKER_01]: catastrophes, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: The meaning is how the patient see his
pain, what he think about his pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there is a lot of Israelis
here, we call it, I affect the Polanyi,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much you complain about your pain,
and you see that there is a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement of how the patient see what is
the concept of the pain in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what is the concept of the pain in the
end, there is a huge improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will give you one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: This improvement changing something,
it's critical, it's changing the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will give you one example, one patient
that I know from this questionnaire,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years old patient that's suffering from
neuropathic pain in his back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's living in the basement of his
parents, he's not working, almost not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting out of his bed, he's putting
earphones and earrings, earphones,
[SPEAKER_01]: earphones, and hear music most of the day,
see music.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that it's reducing his pain,
very loud music.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stopped working, he is high depression,
taking medicine for depression,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he starting to take cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis improved a little bit the
pain, but he improved his sleep disorder,
[SPEAKER_01]: reduced the depression, he stopped taking
the medicine for the depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's starting eating better, he's starting
feeling better, he's starting to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: work again, he's starting to have money,
he's starting to go out with his friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: He met a girl in the pub, he become his
boyfriend, they moved to live together,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now there are two weeks before the
wedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's still very happy, it's two weeks
before the wedding, it's before getting
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the top, but think about it
seriously, the huge change of the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy before that, in his bed,
depression, not working, now live with his
[SPEAKER_01]: girlfriend, full time job, have a normal
life, and now you ask him what he think
[SPEAKER_01]: about his pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, what, oops, no, no, no,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a moment, this is the next talk in
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask him what he think about his
pain, in the beginning it was here,
[SPEAKER_01]: horrible, but it's improved, he don't care
about the pain anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is cannabis, and this is a different
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask me how I sit in five years,
these are 85% of the patients in Israel,
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that get cannabis for improving
the quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are pain patients, these are
patients with PTSD, these are patients
[SPEAKER_01]: that getting chemotherapy and getting
cannabis to improve all the side effects
[SPEAKER_01]: of the chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the majority of the patients of
the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you ask me how I sit in five years,
there is two roads.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be cannabis as a medicine in
the pharmacies, but there will be two
[SPEAKER_01]: types of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be very accurate, maybe
synthetic, maybe not synthetic,
[SPEAKER_01]: but very accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three molecules in a bottle measured
exactly the amount, milligram per ml,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you will take to treat cancer,
that you take to treat epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you take to treat insomnia,
very specific illnesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be cannabis, which much
more holistic, the whole extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we are the scientists,
we'll never be able to put our finger on
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these, because these three
compounds will improve the appetite,
[SPEAKER_01]: and these two is changing the sleep
disorder, and these five is decreasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all together, you get something that
change the quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Older people, cancer patient, PTSD
patient, pain patient, we use probably
[SPEAKER_01]: these cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is not saying that we need to
stop working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need also here to improve it and to
bring it to the level that it will be
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, accurate, that every time that
you're going and buying a bottle,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grow, we need to improve the way they
grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This must be accurate, that all the
compounds inside will be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be able to measure, I'm able to
measure it today, so the world will know
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will know how to grow it more
efficient, cheaper, without pasteurized,
[SPEAKER_01]: that all the time it will be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can make it also more accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to give one sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did with the collaboration with
Professor Dan Levitus, we create a
[SPEAKER_01]: nanobits that having inside of them a
whole extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: These nanobits capture a whole extract,
and these nanobits release the extract in
[SPEAKER_01]: a slow release.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually we have the whole extract,
all the trupins of flavonoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these nanobits now release all the
active compounds slowly, slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're taking these nanobits and
inject under the skin of the mice that
[SPEAKER_01]: have epilepsy, and we measure,
we see that the bits in two weeks slowly,
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly releasing the cannabis,
the cannabinoids, trupinoids, and
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids, and we can measure it in the
blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look on the seizures, we see that
actually the whole extract in the bits
[SPEAKER_01]: working better than the whole extract
they've been giving on a daily basis to
[SPEAKER_01]: the mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we're giving it one in two weeks,
and here it's once, one every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one worked better because you
don't have the peak of getting and going
[SPEAKER_01]: down and up in the blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sustainable, sustainable amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we measure the CBD and other compounds
in the blood, we see that in the bits
[SPEAKER_01]: there is much more than when we're
injecting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a small example to show
you that even when we're staying in the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole extract, we will find a way to make
it more accurate, better, patches to wipe
[SPEAKER_01]: it better, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need, even in that route, to be much
more accurate, to bring it to the level
[SPEAKER_01]: that the physician will trust what he's
giving, will know what he's giving,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's acting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patient will know what's good to him,
but will know to go back and to buy all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time the same product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank my amazing team that
did all of this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Dr. Shirley, where are you,
Shirley?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shirley Berman that did all of this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the analysis in the fetal cannabinoids
and endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Liran Baranda did all the work on the
cancer, together with Ellie.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the student.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Gilevich is doing all the neurobiology
in the lab, and you see the epilepsy and
[SPEAKER_01]: all my amazing team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a question about the slide that you
showed that had the...
[SPEAKER_07]: red bars and the blue bars.
[SPEAKER_07]: It appeared that after 120 days on the
blue side, you actually saw a greater
[SPEAKER_07]: amount of catastrophizing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that was interpreted
correctly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my second question is,
the imaging that you did, was that using
[SPEAKER_07]: an in-cell?
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you're asking?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is improved in the catastrophe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is improved.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a large argument with my student.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, improve, I want to see it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even the catastrophe going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I missed seeing the improvement.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess there was no indication there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So improving pain and improving the
catastrophe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other question was, what was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: The imaging that you did, what was that
using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which equipment?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have many.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have IncuSight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the molecular device.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three different.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's from the molecular device.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of instrument was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife said that I will never have
Alzheimer's because I remember nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch me after, I will check for you.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Matt Gordon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a question about, you've
discovered, you've narrowed it down by the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of elimination and discovered
three cannabinoids that worked as good as
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if you took that profile that
you knew was killing that type of cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: and you mixed it with some other oil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that suddenly change the profile and
make it not kill that cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not changing the profile,
but it's really dilute the specific
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids to a different amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will need to give more.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, it might be that in the other
extract, there will be things that
[SPEAKER_01]: competing with the receptors and will
block it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never tried it, so I don't know to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't try to mix it with other oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a common thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, in the United States,
people take five or six or 20 strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: make oil, and combine it all together to
hopefully hit all the receptors or cure
[SPEAKER_00]: for cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take 60 grams and 90 days of ethanol
extract, like Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just wondering if in the end... It
reminds me a joke that we're telling in
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel that the guy need to go to do a P
exam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how you're saying that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the terminology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's coming and he said, I brought all
the family, check it all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys haven't mixed oils and seen if it
was still effective or in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had something that cured another
cancer, like a completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: compound after mixing 20 different strains
or what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need another 45 students.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see nothing, so I'm just...
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for some of the diseases or complaints
that you were talking about, pain and
[SPEAKER_03]: epilepsy, the medicines that are often
prescribed for those types of things have
[SPEAKER_03]: really bad side effect profiles,
destroy organs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question is, why is cannabis a last
resort?
[SPEAKER_03]: With such a benign side effect profile for
cannabis, why is cannabis the last choice?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have two good answers for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we don't know the damage that
cannabis is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're assuming it's not doing,
which is not really true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really following on Rick Simpson
oil patient, they have a lot of bleeding
[SPEAKER_01]: in their intestines and there is damage
that cannabis can do and we don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed in a publication with Professor
Gilbert Sela a few months ago that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're taking immunotherapy with cannabis,
cannabis is actually blocking the
[SPEAKER_01]: immunotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ted, why not to give everybody... I'm
not sure it's a right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, because we have better medicines
in other illnesses, sometimes work.
[SPEAKER_01]: A physician needs to check his patient and
to choose the best medicine that's working
[SPEAKER_01]: the best for this patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nice in these conferences where
we said why not to give, but it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: physician responsibility to choose what
they think is the best for this patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope they are doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless we will have more data to know
where to give and which patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will take more time and I'm quite
aligned with the physician on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a lot of, I don't know how to
say it in English, but disinformation and
[SPEAKER_01]: things about cannabis that cause the
physician not to give them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm giving free to the mice,
so I don't have this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just curious if you'd identified a
molecular target yet for your 331B8
[SPEAKER_08]: compound or if you know mechanistically
how that's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know it's binding TRPV1,
but I don't know mechanistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's binding and releasing calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that when I'm blocking TRPV1,
then it's not binding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a lot of time to be able to
purify that in a good way and to have it
[SPEAKER_01]: really purified in my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's just a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time, it takes me around three
weeks to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So still, there is technical things that
takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I summarize what I succeed to do in the
last four years, it's not the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to build the tools to ask the
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few months ago, I think four or five
months ago, I sat with my students.
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed results.
[SPEAKER_01]: We reached the point that we can really
start to ask questions and answer them
[SPEAKER_01]: when we have the ability to measure the
endocannabinoids, the receptors,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fetocannabinoids, to analyze them,
to separate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before that, we didn't have the tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dr. Mary, Kristen Walsh-Lengel from
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can imagine who is talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blonde from the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: An interesting thing happened last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if you've seen it or if
you might be curious about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an irregular heartbeat since youth
needed a pacemaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was before we knew I needed that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd stopped my beta blocker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And coincidentally, I was with an
implanted cardiac monitor, 24-hour
[SPEAKER_05]: monitoring recorded.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bottom line is, I stopped the beta blocker
so the doctor could see my rhythm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my rhythm stopped misbehaving.
[SPEAKER_05]: It turned out I had simultaneously started
using a dilution of beta-karyophylline,
[SPEAKER_05]: orally about 400, 500 milligrams a day in
divided doses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realized after two months without a
single episode of arrhythmia that there
[SPEAKER_05]: might be something going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I found one preclinical research
on triple negative breast cancer cells
[SPEAKER_05]: that had beta-2 adrenergic receptors on
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they claim it was an inverse agonist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just thought I'd toss that out there
as a softball.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when we're talking about the
entourage effect, if there's a beta
[SPEAKER_05]: blocker effect with the most common
terpene, beta-karyophylline, maybe we can
[SPEAKER_05]: start to elucidate this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it doesn't distinctly have the
anti-cancer aspect, though there is some
[SPEAKER_05]: of that in cancer research.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more about just kind of clarifying
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's a molecule, we're seeing an
uptick in use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any knowledge on the
beta-karyophylline piece and beta
[SPEAKER_05]: blocking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I will answer that
generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I didn't work specifically
with beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never separated from the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, I think what we will see in
the next few years is that few indications
[SPEAKER_01]: will disappear and few things that will
appear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think heart diseases and affecting
on heart and other things like that will
[SPEAKER_01]: be a major because the heart is full of
endocannabins and receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know it's been affected by cannabis
and by terpenes and by the flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids A and B being shown to affect
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm quite sure it will be a big... I
was just curious because they distinctly
[SPEAKER_05]: confirmed in the preclinical research
about the beta-2 adrenergic receptor,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was an inverse agonist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the only note.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just thought I'd ask.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for all your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Daddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Mara.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just by voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's me just by voice,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick, quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the standard available for the 33118B
for... Well, when are you going to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: available so that we can all test for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on that, literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I send two of my workers last week to the
states to examine which best equipment to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy for that in order to start to purify
it in a better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now I'm purifying and using it to
my research, but it takes a lot of time
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to do it more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to have it and, you know... Well,
I'll be waiting on... We're academia,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're creating knowledge to give it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we'll be ready.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Dr. Pranagast, primary care physician
from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have lots of cannabis there,
as you know, but we have very little
[SPEAKER_04]: purified product that we can use.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found in my practice that the best one
that I can use is a three to one ratio,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is three CBD to one THC,
which is the most useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, being limited to only a few right
now, legislatively, would you say CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: alone for... I use it for inflammatory
conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use the CBD CBN, which is also
available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the only two that are available
legally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So broad spectrum, what do you think about
a three to one CBD to THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, I think you need to
understand that I'm not a physician.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what is good for patient
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know to look for mechanism, to answer a
big question, to look on the wide aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know to treat patient,
unfortunately, and I don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, I would say in the cannabis
field to say, I found three to one is the
[SPEAKER_01]: best ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will ask to make me sleepy or to make me
awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean the best one?
[SPEAKER_01]: The best one for what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every indication on every disease,
you need a different aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, like inflammatory conditions,
autoimmune conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found that to be CBD, three CBD to one
THC, unactivated, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I found that to work very well with
the limited scope that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like the broad spectrum thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're taking a specific strain and
it's work for you three to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned from cooking, what is work
for you don't change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we work on multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple sclerosis, kind of inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have strains that causing the disease to
be so severe that the mice not survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have strains that the mice are
almost curing from the disease with the
[SPEAKER_01]: same ratio of CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know to answer in CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're asking the wrong person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that it's much more complicated
than working with CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's known that CBD, and Rafi showed in
the morning, in the GVDH patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD alone can reduce the activity of the
immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ratio between that and THC,
I haven't the clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for your talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're highlights every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see patients and recommend to patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I started, after coming to one of
these conferences, I give my patients
[SPEAKER_06]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say, get a whole plant extract in this
approximate ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what came back to me is there's no
such thing in the dispensaries as a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: plant extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's combinations of different
cannabinoids in different ratios.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I'm doing microdosing with one to
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just curious and changing the
ratios and so forth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just curious, do you see any value to
using a whole plant and having the patient
[SPEAKER_06]: make their own extract?
[SPEAKER_06]: From a whole plant in order to get more
likelihood of the entourage effect?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do I stick with oils and microdose
sublingually, which is kind of what I do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I take care of a lot of elderly
patients and none of them are interested
[SPEAKER_06]: in inhalational therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, again, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a physician.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not asking about patients, just asking
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a lottery.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking a very complicated,
can be inhibited, can activate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once can help, not cannot help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that outside,
in the field, with the patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to take a decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I admire the physician that doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're doing very right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to help the patient with what
we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say something else that might
be the audience here won't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe in that the patient need
to take a decision for himself and make
[SPEAKER_01]: the medicine for himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw a person getting to emergency
room and say to the doctor, leave it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't see any patient lying down
with things to his veins and decide what
[SPEAKER_01]: to put inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe in self-curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in physicians that learn a lot
of years and know better to take
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not always right, not always good.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of mistakes, but better than the
patient will take for his self-decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that even though you might
lose few parameters, it still need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: in your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's totally my opinion here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see if there is more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the blonde.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me again.
[SPEAKER_03]: The endocannabinoid system, is it taught
in Israeli medical schools?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not taught in most medical
schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a complicated answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have in Israel already courses for
physician, nurses, pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is more than, I think, eight
courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of them is part of the Ministry of
Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of them is through the universities
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the main courses for medical
school, I'm not sure we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Yossi, you started, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Yossi Tam, which we'll speak later from
University of Jerusalem, started a course
[SPEAKER_01]: like that for the medical student there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my university, in the Technion,
we're talking about to start from next
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Jerusalem universities,
it started already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have Rafi Mishulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fair, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody can argue with us that it's
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Godfather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
