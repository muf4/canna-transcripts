[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for attending my talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also like to thank the CanMed
organizers for inviting me here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The background image on my title slide is
actually not related to the core of the
[SPEAKER_02]: talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you might like to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a fossilized cannabis leaf dating
to the Oligocene era, approximately 30
[SPEAKER_02]: million years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: The title of my talk is not classifying
cannabis with genetics, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get into that a little bit
anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: The title is ethnobotanogenomics in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to focus on the genomic
consequences of economics and law as
[SPEAKER_02]: forces of selection during cannabis
domestication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethnobotanogenomics is a word that I made
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a portmanteau of ethnobotany,
which is the study of plants and human
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions in genomics, which is the
study of genomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a key resource in genome research is,
of course, a reference genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll spend a little bit of time
talking about the reference that I
[SPEAKER_02]: assembled and released last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The project design included deep
sequencing of three haplotypes and two
[SPEAKER_02]: components.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, the marijuana by hemp cross and the
genome assembly and physical mapping of
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDRx.
[SPEAKER_02]: The genetic map was based on the
sequencing of a recombinant F2 population
[SPEAKER_02]: developed by George Wieblen's group at the
University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, two near isogenic lines were
developed by inbreeding skunk number one
[SPEAKER_02]: and Carmen for several generations to make
their genomes homozygous.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were crossed to produce a hybrid F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: An F1 female was hermaphrodized using
colloidal silver and then self-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds from the F1 grew into the
recombinant F2 population to be sequenced
[SPEAKER_02]: with whole genome low coverage alumina.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also measured important agronomic
traits in the F2 population, such as
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid profiles, and plant
architecture.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this slide on the right, I show the
genotypes, which are indicated in rows,
[SPEAKER_02]: of 96 of the F2s, each of which is
indicated by a column in that square on
[SPEAKER_02]: the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a chromosome where you see
blue, those regions of the genome
[SPEAKER_02]: inherited from the marijuana grandparent,
and yellow is regions of the genome
[SPEAKER_02]: inherited from the hemp grandparent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green is heterozygous regions of the
genome, and transitions in color indicates
[SPEAKER_02]: where crossover events happen during
meiosis in the F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each row, again, is a unique
segregation pattern of genes in the F2
[SPEAKER_02]: population, which you can correlate with
the segregation of traits to determine the
[SPEAKER_02]: regions of the genome contributing to
those traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: The core genome assembly, was based on the
sequencing of a highly inbred line from
[SPEAKER_02]: functional remedies called CBDRx.
[SPEAKER_02]: Todd Michael at the JCVI generated a total
of 100x coverage of the CBDRx genome with
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxford Nanopore and alumina reads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxford Nanopore Minion is a USB device
about the stick of gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Minion contains protein pores embedded
in a glass plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Electrodes measure the electrical
resistance as DNA molecules pass through
[SPEAKER_02]: the pore, which is used to model the DNA
sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Minion generates the longest reads of
any DNA sequencing technology,
[SPEAKER_02]: and long reads are essential for
assembling repeat rich plant genomes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but have a higher rate at the nucleotide
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we assemble the long reads and the long
contigs to get the genome structure right,
[SPEAKER_02]: and polish the contigs with highly
accurate, high coverage, aluminidated to
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect the nucleotide sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: We further set scaffolding with a high C
library from Phase Genomics, and it ended
[SPEAKER_02]: up with a little less than 2,000 contigs
that form the basis of the physical map.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I integrated the genetic and
physical maps to produce chromosome scale
[SPEAKER_02]: pseudo molecules corresponding to the 10
chromosomes of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The animation depicted in my slide shows
each chromosome in white, with the gene's
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic position on the Y axis,
shown in centimorgans, and the physical
[SPEAKER_02]: position shown in mega base pairs on the X
axis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also show the recombination rate in red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important because it tells us
how tightly linked two positions in the
[SPEAKER_02]: genome are, which is very valuable for
designing breeding experiments,
[SPEAKER_02]: involving marker assisted selection,
and for evolutionary inference,
[SPEAKER_02]: which most of my talk will be on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Note the extreme recombination suppression
in the center of the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 90% of the genetic recombination
takes place in about 10% of the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the CBDRX genome was released late last
year, and has proven a valuable resource
[SPEAKER_02]: for the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite citations is this
recent preprint that identified the sex
[SPEAKER_02]: chromosome as chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: In their main figure, they show the
expression of sex specific genes in red
[SPEAKER_02]: and blue bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are now several whole genomes
available for cannabis, and we can use
[SPEAKER_02]: them to cross validate each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the right is a figure that Kevin
McKernan presented yesterday in his talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a centenic plot of the Jamaican line
assembly against the CBDRX assembly.
[SPEAKER_02]: These diagonal lines indicate a high level
of agreement and validate the structure of
the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm going to switch gears a little
bit and put on my evolutionary biologist
[SPEAKER_02]: hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to review some key concepts,
so it'll be helpful for the rest of my
[SPEAKER_02]: talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the center of the slide is phenotype,
the composite of an organism's traits and
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm guessing most of you are most
interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant's phenotype is controlled in
large part by its genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The definition of evolution that I'm using
today is change in allele frequency over
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: An organism's interaction with its
environment is called the niche,
[SPEAKER_02]: the ecological niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: These interactions influence a
reproductive success to a great degree and
[SPEAKER_02]: thus drive evolution at the population
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: An ecological niche includes its habitat,
such as precipitation, temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: day length, soil nutrients, as well as
interactions with pollinators and
[SPEAKER_02]: predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the ecological niche of domesticated
organisms, also includes its interaction
[SPEAKER_02]: with human culture, how it's used,
the demand for its product, how the
[SPEAKER_02]: product is regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a picture of some wild cannabis
growing in its native habitat in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Eurasian steppe.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant is well adapted to a weedy life
history on this riverbank, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: look like a particularly valuable crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's short and branching and makes small
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the past few millennia, humans have
selected for composite traits very
[SPEAKER_02]: different from this and in the process
domesticated two very different crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a picture of some fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very tall, doesn't branch much and
can be mechanically harvested with ease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the biomass is allocated to the
stems, which the fibers are harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabinoids are typically undesirable in
fiber hemp as they gum up the processing
[SPEAKER_02]: machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most hemp is not very intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So contrast this with marijuana,
pictured here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, marijuana is relatively short,
branches more, allocates a large
[SPEAKER_02]: proportion of biomass to its flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The majority of our precious cannabinoids
are secreted into glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a principal component analysis,
or PCA, of genetic data from about 300
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals from four different studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: A PCA is a statistical technique for
compressing millions of genetic variants
[SPEAKER_02]: down to a few dimensions, or principal
components, that explain the most variants
[SPEAKER_02]: in the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each individual is represented by a single
point in the plot and it's colored
[SPEAKER_02]: according to its functional class.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plot shows the top two principal
components.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can conceptualize the Y axis as how
far along the individual is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: domestication process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The X axis corresponds to the primary
principal component and clearly separates
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana from hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: As humans selected for different
phenotypes to process into different
[SPEAKER_02]: products, the populations evolve
genetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plot below is a more granular view of
each individual's ancestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each column in the lower plot is a stacked
bar plot showing the percent ancestry and
[SPEAKER_02]: its genomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the genomes from each of the
three functional classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another way to look at population
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a population branch statistic,
which is based on how similar allele
[SPEAKER_02]: frequencies in populations are.
[SPEAKER_02]: The longer the branch, the more
differentiated the populations are from
[SPEAKER_02]: each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice the small inset tree near the
histogram.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the genome-wide average of the
population statistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know from the previous slide that
marijuana and hemp are highly
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiated and that is reflected in
the branch lengths.
[SPEAKER_02]: The large tree, however, is drawn in the
same scale as the small tree, which shows
[SPEAKER_02]: the population branch statistic of the
synthase locus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an extreme outlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look back at the histogram,
it shows the distribution of branch
[SPEAKER_02]: lengths in the marijuana line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've indicated the 99.95th percentile in
the dotted line and shown with an arrow
[SPEAKER_02]: where the synthase locus lies in that
distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: What this tells me is that there's been
strong divergent selection for very
[SPEAKER_02]: different phenotypes or alleles producing
those phenotypes at the synthase locus.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at the land race or the natural
populations, we actually have a negative
[SPEAKER_02]: branch length suggesting that the locus
evolves neutrally in the wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not under strong natural selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about high CBD cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: High CBD cannabis plants typically have
mostly marijuana-like phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're shorter, more branching.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have very large flowers and are high
in total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they are low in THC and are
non-intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a mosaic phenotype of both
marijuana-like and hemp-like traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did we get here?
[SPEAKER_02]: This animation shows changes in cannabis
law in the United States through time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past five years, laws have been
passed progressively legalizing CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we all know, last year's farm bill
legalized hemp and CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: The law classifies hemp as a cannabis
plant that produces less than 0.3 percent
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a bar plot showing a steady
increase in CBD sales over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: My core argument here is that these two
changes, legalization of CBD coupled with
[SPEAKER_02]: a steady increase in sales, opened up an
unprecedented ecological niche that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: new way for cannabis to interact with
human culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a genome plot for the 10 CBDRX
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how I mentioned that the genetic
map could be used to identify regions of
[SPEAKER_02]: the genome responsible for functional
traits?
[SPEAKER_02]: In this plot, I show the loci responsible
for traits pertinent to producing the
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana and hemp phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loci responsible for plant architecture
are indicated by green and gold stars,
[SPEAKER_02]: total cannabinoids by black stars,
and the synthase locus with the red star.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also colored the chromosomes according
to their ancestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regions of the genome inherited from
marijuana ancestors are colored in blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regions inherited from hemp ancestors are
colored in yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see that the CBDRX genome is about
90 percent marijuana derived and about 10
[SPEAKER_02]: percent hemp derived.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just as high CBD plants have mosaic
phenotypes, they also have mosaic genomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mosaic patterns are the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a graphical summary of the concept
I just discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana and hemp have long been selected
for very different phenotype and have
[SPEAKER_02]: diverged genetically, as indicated by the
three colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The law, however, is only concerned with
percent THC and the legal classification
[SPEAKER_02]: of plants is indicated by the style of
shading.
[SPEAKER_02]: The breeding history of high CBD cannabis
varieties involved the intergression of
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp-like synthase loci into a
predominantly marijuana-like genomic
[SPEAKER_02]: background.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a schematic of my mental model of
population dynamics in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The right-hand side illustrates the
domestication process, which we have
[SPEAKER_02]: covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm also interested in the global
patterns of biogeography and dispersal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll conclude my talk today with some
preliminary analyses of old world
[SPEAKER_02]: biogeography.
[SPEAKER_02]: I scraped some genetic data provided by
the now-defunct Hope and Cannabis Project
[SPEAKER_02]: and clustered approximately 100
individuals based on shared ancestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this matrix, each row or column is a
single individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cells are colored according to the
proportion of shared ancestry,
[SPEAKER_02]: with yellow indicating low level of shared
ancestry, moderate shared ancestry,
[SPEAKER_02]: and red and high in pink or blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this plot, I intentionally emitted
elite hemp and marijuana cultivars in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to highlight the differences between
land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: The samples loosely cluster into 18 groups
and show a pattern of isolation by
[SPEAKER_02]: distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most differentiated clusters are those
of Central Africa and Central Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice the tree at the top of the plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I overlaid this tree from the previous
slide on the geographic map to get this
[SPEAKER_02]: figure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red arrows show hypothesized dispersal
routes by which cannabis expanded its
[SPEAKER_02]: range.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also map the old world physical
biogeography on a physical map of the
[SPEAKER_02]: genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this animation, I colored genomic
segments according to the predicted
[SPEAKER_02]: ancestry, found the elite hemp cultivar to
be descended primarily from the Slavic
[SPEAKER_02]: lands of Central and Eastern Europe,
while the elite marijuana cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: descended mostly from South Asia and the
Middle East.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for attending my talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at Harvard University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of this was done as a consultant for
Sunrise Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The genetic mapping population was
developed at the University of Minnesota
[SPEAKER_02]: by George Wieblen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Todd Michael at the JCVI produced most of
the core sequencing data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Functional Remedies of Colorado provided
some funding, and the CBDRF.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, none of this would have
been possible without all these amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: sequencing technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll take questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was curious, looking at the range of
phenotypes you were covering there in the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, do you have any sense of whether
you feel like there's limits on kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme phenotypes that you can get out of
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something predictable?
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that there is a limit on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at like maize yields over the
past century, there's been a linear
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship between yield and time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we keep pushing it,
the plants will respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, fascinating talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious if you could go sort of back
in time, what were sort of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: selective pressures that you've identified
from that wild type that you showed a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of that was essentially nothing
that anybody would resemble, nothing that
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody would consider to be a... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, cannabis sativa is,
you know, I consider it a single species
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The native range is probably like the
Eurasian steppe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so depending on where the population
was located, that would dictate kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: what it was adapted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see extreme variation and day length
and precipitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, you know, all of this wild
germplasm potentially could be a great
[SPEAKER_02]: source for breeding if we can collect the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
Thank you.
