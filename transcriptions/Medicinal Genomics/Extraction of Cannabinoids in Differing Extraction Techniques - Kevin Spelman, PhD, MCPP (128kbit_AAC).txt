[SPEAKER_02]: So this spot you never want to have is the
last lecture of the day in the B room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm honored that you're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me walk you through a little story
here about ethanol extractions of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly, there's a huge number of home
gardens, or one of the areas where I got
[SPEAKER_02]: my biggest education on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those home gardens were actually home
forests of cannabis trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result of all this legalization,
a lot of people are making stuff at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the things that I've always
been an herbalist first, and then getting
[SPEAKER_02]: into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, cannabis is yet another
medicinal plant, a special one,
[SPEAKER_02]: but another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been making tinctures
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the medical scientist side of me was
like, well, what's in these things?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll start with this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back in the days when I was in between
University of Exeter in the UK and
[SPEAKER_02]: University of North Carolina, I was
working on echinacea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I drilled down really hard for four
years on echinacea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things I was doing,
I kept extracting a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_02]: echinacea angustifolia, echinacea
purpurea, echinacea palata, like all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different species that are out there in
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, most of it is purpurea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some research came out just about
the time I was starting my dissertation
[SPEAKER_02]: work on achillomides or alkalamides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll hear both pronunciations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Binding to CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So suddenly, echinacea was like a
cannabinometic or a phytocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could argue that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a compound in there,
or actually several compounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: these compounds, that would bind CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: I once had the owner of an herb company
come up to me and say, hey, if I take
[SPEAKER_02]: echinacea, is it going to keep me from
getting high?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started looking at these compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, I drilled down pretty
heavily on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't see the way they're shaped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, but if you saw Matullin's lecture
today when he was talking about all these
[SPEAKER_02]: amides, you can see that that tail can
fold and form kind of a partial ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really a ring, but it's an open
ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these bind CB2 rather well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one day I'm in the lab,
and I'm tincturing yet some more echinacea
[SPEAKER_02]: so I can run mass spec analysis on it and
then put it in biological assays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tincture it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wake up in the middle of the night,
and I go, oh my god, I just missed an
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's always been this
discussion in the industry, the medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: plant industry, is how long do you have to
macerate or steep plant material and
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol before it's ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the traditional wisdom has been,
oh, two weeks is good, and four weeks is
[SPEAKER_02]: even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to have a close friend who ran
a lab on an herb company who would say,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I do stuff that's three months,
and it's even better than the one month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've done six months, and it just
rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've always been a little
skeptical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you ask any chemist, and I know
there's probably some chemists in the room
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, they're rolling their eyes
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they already know better,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I woke up the next morning,
went right into the lab, and I took a
[SPEAKER_02]: sample of this tincture that I had planned
on tincturing for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got it at about 24 hours time point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this publication is what came out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this data was buried in a bunch of
mass spec data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nobody really saw this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget which figure it was, but it was
well into the manuscript.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people, their eyes roll back by
the time they get to table two,
[SPEAKER_02]: and figure three, and they're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see here, day two,
in other words, 24 hours later,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see that the relative
concentration of dodeca-tetraene,
[SPEAKER_02]: this alkylamide, is really kind of
peaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you look at day seven, and there's
really no difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you look at day 14, two weeks,
which is what we're supposed to do in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, in the industry,
you've got barrels and barrels,
[SPEAKER_02]: and all these herb shops, all these herb
production firms, facilities, filling
[SPEAKER_02]: floor space, because it's sitting there
for weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so I was like, well, and let's
make sure we go 21 days so that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: show that there's really no difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, the chemists in the room are
going, yeah, yeah, what's the news here?
[SPEAKER_02]: But the herbalists in the room were blown
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not in this room, but maybe you are
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I showed you the data I'm about
to do, you're going to be really quite
[SPEAKER_02]: surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to the literature, and I said to
myself, self, can I find anything better
[SPEAKER_02]: than 24 hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: And found a couple of studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, they weren't on cannabis,
but they're pulling compounds that have
[SPEAKER_02]: some lipophilicity to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, we're looking at carnosol
and carnosic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ethanol at 70% versus ethanol at 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they got a methanol in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I typically ignore that, because we're not
going to use that to make tinctures,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see that really at three hours,
there's not a lot of difference between
[SPEAKER_02]: six hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: But six hours really kind of peaks,
and there's not really much difference
[SPEAKER_02]: between six hours and 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm going, OK, so we've got
something close to three hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we've got something close to six
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many hours do we really need?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's another study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, three hours in this particular
case, carnosic acid, there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I went to the cannabis literature,
and I looked at some literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some tincture literature
research out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here, this one actually is really new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is actually, no, sorry,
this is the 2008 one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They looked at 20%, 40%, and 80% ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, I think most people,
when they're tincturing with ethanol,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're usually using 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we did, and I'll tell you
why in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you really want a full spectrum
extract, you're probably going to want to
[SPEAKER_02]: use lower than 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what will it cost you?
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll cost you some small percentage of
THC or THCA because of their
[SPEAKER_02]: lipophilicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're also going to get more
flavonoids that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably going to get more terpenes
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: 70% to 80% tends to be the sweet spot with
a lot of different compounds, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: polyphenols.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see that here for the most part in
terms of distribution of THC and THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I said, let's take this to
cannabis and check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took a batch of cannabis,
and this is him.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chemo type is CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used a 400-micron sieve,
so kind of a coarse grind, and homogenized
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we got done with homogenizing,
we homogenized it some more because I knew
[SPEAKER_02]: that the whole thing had to depend on that
starting biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had to be mixed really, really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we mixed it and mixed it and mixed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we took 100-gram samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collected and added 500 grams of 95%
ethanol to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to steep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the maceration treatment started.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we also had an arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm realizing now I have that arm in
the wrong place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also took and did some percolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to show you that data in a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really want to focus on the
maceration right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those of you who don't know
percolation, I'll explain that process in
[SPEAKER_02]: a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to try two different
traditional home used techniques,
[SPEAKER_02]: the maceration and the percolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we went through a couple more
steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collected the mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mark, if you're not familiar with
herbal medicine, the mark is the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: material, the biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you would press that mark,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'd get the press from the
mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd also get the pour off,
the liquor that you poured off the
[SPEAKER_02]: tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll show you these steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this doesn't make sense just yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we did is we did independent
duplicate extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we took triplicate samples from
each of those duplicates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did triplicate analysis of the
triplicate samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to really stick with some good
statistics, because I knew that the herb
[SPEAKER_02]: industry would never believe me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the starting biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, we mixed and mixed and
mixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's where we ended up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was about 8.5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your average is 8.4% CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see our p-value is pretty
strong there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we ran it through the sieve,
a four micron, or 4,000, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_02]: microns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to really mimic home extractions,
we took ball jars, which is usually what
[SPEAKER_02]: herbalists use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've used forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fascinatingly, my house used to be so
full of ball jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I partnered with a lovely
woman, I kind of let go of the ball jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now my house is full of jars again,
because she cans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, those jars are menacing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the dishwasher, because I'm
the guy that deals with the dishwasher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then after we tinctured, we poured off
the liquor, or often called the minstrum
[SPEAKER_02]: in herbal medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We poured that off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we took the mark, which is
wrapped in the cheesecloth there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we pressed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we bought a press that was easily
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually you have these high,
like five ton presses that you use that
[SPEAKER_02]: are like car jack kind of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we just bought this wine press off
of Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was $74.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we had something that was really
readily available and wasn't super
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, it did OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's presses that will do much
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we pressed the mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see on the left side of the
screen, that's what we poured off from the
[SPEAKER_02]: ball jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the right side of the screen,
is now the remaining liquid that was in
[SPEAKER_02]: the biomass that got pressed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a molecule we were looking
for, cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this cannabis was decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here's what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: At three minutes versus one hour versus
two week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in one hour, this extraction was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, the cannabis chemist in
here going, yeah, yeah, are you going to
[SPEAKER_02]: tell me something I don't know yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: But at three minutes, we had 94% of the
one hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it always made me wonder, because this
quick wash technique that you hear about,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cold wash or a quick wash,
that's faster than three minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would guess, but I'd like to do this
study, I'd guess that they're probably
[SPEAKER_02]: getting pretty high yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you compare the drain versus
the press CBD, and this is the problem
[SPEAKER_02]: that people have at home, pressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some people take the cheesecloth,
the plant materials wrapped in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cheesecloth, and they just turn it and
squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to do that, because look at
the amount of CBD we got from the press.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it was much lower volume,
the amount that we got was actually pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you always want to press, and it's not
hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we looked at the mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the mark after it's been
pressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you looked at this, you would
argue that it looks to me like that two
[SPEAKER_02]: week mark has got less CBD in it,
and therefore, it probably should have had
[SPEAKER_02]: a higher yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it actually didn't, according to the
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did we lose some CBD somewhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm still scratching my head on this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, I don't have the stat bars
in here, but I don't think this was
[SPEAKER_02]: statistically significant in terms of the
1.16 to 0.98.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it also may be a factor here.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, now let's turn to the percolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so now what have we learned?
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I really want you to get is
there might be a reason to run a tincture
[SPEAKER_02]: for longer than an hour, or even I'm
guessing half an hour is enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's another study.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be a reason to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people get into the moon cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what you're into, maybe that's
the way to do it for your medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: the medicine you want to give to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for chemistry, you don't need two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just really need a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you make a percolation cone?
[SPEAKER_02]: So percolation cones, in old pharmacies,
you can still find them back in the back
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf, hidden with dust all over them,
because they haven't been moved in like 40
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But old pharmacies, this is one of the
ways that we made medicine in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States, that pharmacists made medicine in
the United States for decades and decades,
[SPEAKER_02]: is they would get a big percolation cone,
and by big, they were this size,
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones that I know of, and they're a
cone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the trick here is the liquid flow
through that cone, because you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: moving liquid, which is one of the things
you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I should tell you about
maceration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every one of those macerations were
stirred vigorously for one minute,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the timing started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the same sort of way we used we have
movement here, and movement is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I was talking about
yesterday with extractions is there's
[SPEAKER_02]: really four crucial factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one may be agitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a sort of agitation,
a movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you make a percolation cone out
of a Perrier bottle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you score the top of it,
and herbalists have been doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You score the top of it, and now you have
an opening at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you hang onto your cap, the cap that
you would use to close it, and that
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes a stopcock.
[SPEAKER_02]: That becomes a way of controlling your
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we ran that percolation,
and there's been an age-old argument
[SPEAKER_02]: between herbalists about what's better,
maceration or percolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about a percolation is it only
takes usually a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a couple hours, and it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're doing percolation right,
if you go and you read the United States
[SPEAKER_02]: Pharmacopeia from way back, when that's
the way they were making medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: they tell you to take the biomass and just
really moisten it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not in liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just moistened with ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you think about that,
one of the things that it does is it
[SPEAKER_02]: breaks down the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you do that, then with that moist
stuff, then you've got to pack the cone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that pack is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's too loose, the liquid's just going
to run through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's too tight, the liquid's not
going to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people that do this for a living get
really good at packing these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're comparing it to the two-week
comparison here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So liquid recovery was about 67.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the total liquid that we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the liquid recovery was about 67.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first extraction, about 72%.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the next extraction, in the PERC,
it was higher all around, 76 and 74.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind that we actually tried to
press the mark that came from the PERC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got zero milliliters from it,
because it was already so dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is another advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only do you not need a press,
but you've collected all the liquor that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to possibly get from a
percolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if we look at CBD recovery,
and that's the darker gray there that you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to look at, the PERC1, we got about
80%, 79.2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And PERC2, we got about 81% as compared to
about 61% versus 65%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now keep in mind, this is not 61% CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 61% recovery of the CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started with about 8.8 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got 61% of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's your graph.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I compared it here on the graph,
a one hour versus the percolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see it's really significantly
higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you got about 15% more CBD in that
percolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shorter time period, doesn't take up a
bunch of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So future directions for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I'd really like to do is
I'd like to do a quick wash comparison to
[SPEAKER_02]: a short maceration just to see what's
going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also like to experiment with percent
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say that not so much because I'm
interested in the cannabinoid yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: although I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more interested in being able to look
at the polyphenols and comparing the
[SPEAKER_02]: polyphenol content at 100%, which is what
most people are using for their
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid extracts, versus like 70% or
80%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd like to do some studies with
hot ethanol, with cold ethanol,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then room temperature ethanol in both
a percolation method and a maceration
[SPEAKER_02]: method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethan.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of quickies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't gather what the temperature was
of the ethanol you were using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Room temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So say you were using fresh material
rather than dried.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't it make sense then to use the
high proof ethanol?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought about showing some data like
that from some other work I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you're using fresh plant
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk this through for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you notice that we did a one to five.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is traditional dry plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: One to five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people now are doing one to three
just to make things stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one part is plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five parts is the solvent, the minstrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you use water, depending on what part
of the plant you are, you've probably got
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere between 85% to 95% water
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we say in the industry that fresh
plants should be one to two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you really do the math there,
it's really about a one to 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dry plant ends up being chemically
stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be reasons, for example,
enzymatic action in the drying process
[SPEAKER_02]: that breaks down compounds for doing a
fresh plant versus a dry plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a fresh plant, even though it's one to
two, with that 90% water content,
[SPEAKER_02]: right, is not really one to two.
[SPEAKER_02]: More like one to 10, one to 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupefied, I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go back to what the percolation
cone looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're doing this right,
and it doesn't have to be done this way,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you're doing this right with the
old percolation cones, they were really
[SPEAKER_02]: tall so that you could pour all the
solvent or minstrum in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you were done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could walk away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, with smaller bottles like Perrier,
you can't necessarily do that because it
[SPEAKER_02]: depends on how full you fill the bottle
with the plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't necessarily do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if it's too full, you're just
going to have to stand there and keep
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you get a proper percolation cone,
and they're hard to find, and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: really expensive, you can just pour it in
and be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for sharing this
information because I feel like you were
[SPEAKER_00]: taking thoughts right out of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, can you turn that off?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hear, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of that is my age, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate your talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you're pulling thoughts right
out of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've said for a long time, I feel like
percolations are a missing link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious if you did other tests or
you did double washes because in
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional percolation, sometimes you do
a second wash through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd be curious the other things
that you tested for in the tincture,
[SPEAKER_00]: like what other compounds you're looking
for, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're bringing up a great, great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ran a production facility for a
while, a CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we definitely looked at our mark to
see what was left, the CBD sitting in the
[SPEAKER_02]: mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things we found was that we
were only getting about half of the CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: with the CO2 extraction that we were
using.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is supercritical fluid extraction,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started running again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we'd take it and we'd do it with
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd yield more CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in this case, according to this data
and this model, it looks like there's not
[SPEAKER_02]: much left.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like there's less than 20% of CBD
left at the very most.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, you could run it again and
probably get more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not sure how much more you would
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you test for other compounds as well
besides?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something I meant to say when I
started this very quick lecture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have any funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was all out of pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we did it as cheaply as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I insisted on triplicate samples of
triplicate samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So temperature, let's start from the
30,000 foot view level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really well known that heat is a
factor that can pull out more yield in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of most compounds that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having said that, you can also use too
much heat and destroy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Polyphenols start to break ground around
140 to 160, depending on the polyphenol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turpenes, as you know, can be actually
much less than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at hot water versus cold
water extractions, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: marshmallow root, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not talking about craft
marshmallows that you throw on a yucky
[SPEAKER_02]: milk chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at least use dark chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, graham cracker and I'm talking
about actual marshmallows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Althea alficinalis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold extractions will pull out the
polysaccharides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's believed much better than a warm
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's a hot extraction, you've
almost destroyed the polysaccharides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for gut relief, the way people use it,
it really needs to be a cold extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or at least that's the dogma in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to do that study too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just depends on what you're after,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot versus cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to throw this out there
because this is something that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: believe but the industry believes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is that if we use cold ethanol,
we avoid chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: And chlorophyll gives it this acrid taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, you can buy chlorophyll,
liquid chlorophyll in the health food
[SPEAKER_02]: store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever tasted that stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not acrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, cannabinoids are acrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is it that, why are we so afraid
of chlorophyll?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if somebody can explain that to me
after, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't believe that cold ethanol is
effective at reducing chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me rephrase that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be effective at reducing
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold ethanol may be effective at reducing
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: But chlorophyll is not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I don't believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So heat, it just depends on what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm rambling and it's time and I'm
going to call it quits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
