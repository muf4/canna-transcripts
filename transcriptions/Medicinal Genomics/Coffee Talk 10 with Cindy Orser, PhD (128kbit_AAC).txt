[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing, many of whom will be
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the CanMed 2021 conference in
Pasadena, California, April 12th through
[SPEAKER_02]: 14th.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Ben Amarald, and yes,
you heard that correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't listen to our last episode,
or you haven't signed up for email alerts,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you don't follow us on social media,
then you may not have heard that CanMed
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020 has been postponed to April 2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our team made the difficult decision to
push the event back, given the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: California, like most of the US,
is still battling the COVID-19 pandemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: After speaking with the Pasadena
Convention Center, local government
[SPEAKER_02]: officials, as well as the CanMed team,
we felt that moving the event to April
[SPEAKER_02]: 2021 would be the best way for us to
provide a safe environment for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you already purchased your ticket to
the 2020 event, and you have a conflict
[SPEAKER_02]: with the new dates, you are entitled to a
100% refund.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to canmedevents.com slash COVID-19 for
more information.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good news is, the CanMed Coffee Talk
podcast will continue with new episodes
[SPEAKER_02]: every other Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look forward to continuing the CanMed
conversation through this medium,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as on our social media accounts,
and on our website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be announcing our safety keynote
presenter, as well as new speakers and
[SPEAKER_02]: panel discussions throughout this year and
into 2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please sign up for email alerts,
if you haven't already, and please do
[SPEAKER_02]: follow us on Instagram, Facebook,
Twitter, and LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just search for CanMed events.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this episode, I had the pleasure of
speaking with Cindy Orser, chief
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific officer at Clip Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Orser has more than 25 years of
experience innovating technologies related
[SPEAKER_02]: to cannabis, human diagnostics,
and even detecting bio threat agents.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent most of the conversation talking
about the panel Cindy will moderate at
[SPEAKER_02]: CanMed 2021, titled, The Hitting Costs of
Cannabis, Environmental Impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that panel, she and her fellow
panelists will explore how current
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cultivation and cultivation
practices contribute to air pollution,
[SPEAKER_02]: water pollution, and increased energy
consumption, and also how the federal ban
[SPEAKER_02]: on cannabis is actually worsening those
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also talked about terpenes,
because Dr. Orser co-authored a really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting article titled, Making Sense
of Cannabis Strains Through Chemometrics,
[SPEAKER_02]: in review.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cindy is a big proponent of terpene
testing, and the way that it can help
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers better understand the
differences between cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: She also cautions that without terpene
testing, consumers are blind to vape
[SPEAKER_02]: products that may add large, unnatural
amounts of terpenes to the products.
[SPEAKER_02]: To date, there hasn't been any research
into what, if any, health risks come with
[SPEAKER_02]: inhaling those compounds in such large
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I get to my conversation with
Cindy, I would like to thank our episode
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, Terpenes and Testing Magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpenes and Testing Magazine is the
scientific backdrop against which in-depth
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of cannabis news,
compliance and regulation, chemistry,
[SPEAKER_02]: analytical testing, and horticulture
science can fully unfold and crystallize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to terpenesandtesting.com to read their
free blog content, and subscribe to their
[SPEAKER_02]: bi-monthly publication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, this episode of CanMed Coffee
Talk is fueled by the hemp and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp coffee is a healthy, delicious
natural product rich in trace minerals and
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients, providing sustained energy
without the crash of regular coffee.

[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Cindy
[SPEAKER_02]: Orser from Clip Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Cindy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, hi, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank you again for being
part of CanMed 2020 and serving on our
[SPEAKER_02]: advisory board.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's a tremendous help to our
team when it comes to evaluating the
[SPEAKER_02]: abstract submissions and potential
speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on behalf of everyone in the CanMed
team, I want to thank you for that first
[SPEAKER_02]: and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really excited to talk with you
today because I know that you're leading a
[SPEAKER_02]: very interesting panel at this year's
event that's all about the environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: impacts of cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was hoping you could tell us a bit
about what we can expect from that
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the CanMed organizers asked me for
some ideas for panels, what I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: would be interesting, I mean, this is
something that's been on my mind for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while because I think there just has not
been much of any attention placed on what
[SPEAKER_00]: is the true cost of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're taking it from an
environmental perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think because cannabis has been
under federal prohibition for all this
[SPEAKER_00]: while, it's really hindered any research
into what the impact of what is now a
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-billion dollar industry in the
United States on what is still a schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: one drug at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been very limited studies that
have documented the environmental impact
[SPEAKER_00]: from cultivation of cannabis and
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some emerging human
environmental impacts that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: address.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to categorize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to use them to inform policies
going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if we had federal legalization,
I think it would solve almost all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would be able to come up with a
cohesive way of addressing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be federal grant money made
available to study these impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just way overdue, whether we're
looking at air pollution, land use to
[SPEAKER_00]: inform land use policies, energy
consumption and water usage and water
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just the big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other ones that we also don't
talk about, which is just all the waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: the packaging waste that's going unused,
the exposure of cannabis workers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: workplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the unknown long-term
health impacts from chronic administration
[SPEAKER_00]: of high-potency cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a myriad of topics,
but we decided to focus it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it'll be very timely to address
some of these issues in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get some input from some of the people
who are studying this now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like a lot of this research
is sort of in its early stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it definitely is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really been emanating from a handful
of academicians who've taken it up because
[SPEAKER_00]: of their interests and state-based
inquiries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several states are now looking at
sustainability, and they've formed working
[SPEAKER_00]: groups on sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has been some effort put out
there to look at these enormous energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: water costs that go into the indoor grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it takes us right back to
that federal prohibition and the state
[SPEAKER_00]: spending for themselves and coming up with
these incredibly complex regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for growing cannabis that has
forced the industry indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's these intensive energy
operations that are kind of out of sight,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, again, one of those things that
if you don't see it, if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the industry and you're not
aware of it, you might smell the effluent
[SPEAKER_00]: when you drive by some of these big grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you immediately know,
oh, yeah, there's some big grows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't even think about that those
volatile organic compounds are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with emissions from
automobiles and forming destructive
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds contributing to ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to start to get a handle on
what are the levels of these VOCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study done in Colorado that
showed that cannabis indoor grows have
[SPEAKER_00]: probably doubled the volatile organic
emissions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cities along the front range of
Colorado already are dealing with air
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you move into California,
the larger issue is water and water theft
[SPEAKER_00]: and disastrous downstream water
consequences, killing aquatic life and
[SPEAKER_00]: stealing water that would normally be
going to either communities or to other
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, energy is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard some crazy figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know how accurate it is,
but that energy consumption from indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grows is equivalent to about 4% of all the
energy that's consumed in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go into the northwest part of the
country where energy is produced from high
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroelectric power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have the intersection of both
energy production and water use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how should water be used and energy
consumption be used?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we regulate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just all so chaotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be ever so nice if we could
have a cohesive national policy on these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that issue and many others in this
space, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious, so how many or how much of
this sort of environmental impact is due
[SPEAKER_02]: to the fact that a lot of these grows are
indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that is largely the source
of the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what I keep trying to think of any
other agricultural cash crop that this
[SPEAKER_00]: large right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry is multibillion
dollar that is being grown indoor under
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive energy requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think there's any kind of
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the reason it's indoors is
because states and localities,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the industry was standing up,
nobody wanted to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't grow it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not allowed to be grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have these elaborate
security systems, and it should be grown
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And combined with the fact that we have
these artificial geographic boundaries
[SPEAKER_00]: that, oh, you can't move cannabis across
the state line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that requires every cannabis complicit
state to have this very intensive
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I mean, Las Vegas,
why is Las Vegas growing marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's so hot there and Lake Mead is
at its lowest level of all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no other crop that has to be
grown locally because of lack of federal
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't like in Vegas, they don't grow
their own strawberries and grapes and
[SPEAKER_00]: pears and almonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have to grow their own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just doesn't even make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of it is because we don't
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't see it because it's in
these large warehouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't realize how absurd it all is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that these plants should be
growing outdoors, like we see hemp growing
[SPEAKER_00]: finally now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Northern California is unique
because I think there's something like
[SPEAKER_00]: 14,000 trespass grows on federal state and
private land up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California has this recurring law that
if your agricultural plot comes in contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with a waterway that you have a right to
use some of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very unique situation to
California that has led to this massive
[SPEAKER_00]: depletion and erosion of waterways in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because a lot of them are black
market grows, they use massive amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and rodenticides because they
want to kill the small rodents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of those chemicals leach into
the streams and kill the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And end up downstream and somebody's
drinking water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a domino effect here,
it's just time to address it, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting you talk about the
difference between cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations where hemp is pretty much
allowed to be grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently spoke with Seth Crawford,
who's going to be our cultivation keynote
[SPEAKER_02]: at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said one of the main reasons that
he and his brother founded Oregon CBD and
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of went into hemp is because of the
regulations were more sort of relaxed and
[SPEAKER_02]: they could grow at a much larger scale
outdoors and sort of do the breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: activities that they were really
interested in doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that he also highlighted that it's
it's sort of madness that so much of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is grown indoors and locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of my questions I was going to
ask was, you know, how is the impacts of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cultivation on the environment
sort of different or similar than other
[SPEAKER_02]: crops?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you already answered that is
that, you know, no other major crop is
[SPEAKER_02]: really grown indoors, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I am hard pressed to come up
with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the U.S., we used to grow some
ornamental plants and flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, growing in greenhouses would be a
step forward from how it's grown now with
[SPEAKER_00]: all the HVAC requirements in these hot
climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the water consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the other analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember there some commercial for
California almonds and one almond takes 26
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was figuring out how much water
one cannabis plant would take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it uses about six gallons a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if it's a short season of 100
days, that's 600 gallons of water or one
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant that would make,
I don't know, two to five pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think water is going to be a prime
topic of discussion going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more and more of the arable land
around the world is going to become
[SPEAKER_00]: uncultivatable because of the lack of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we need to be smarter and we
certainly could be smarter if we had some
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperation at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's interesting, too, because I
imagine that water consumption must be
[SPEAKER_02]: different in an indoor versus outdoor
environment, just because indoor you might
[SPEAKER_02]: be growing hydroponically or in cocoa or
some other medium instead of planting
[SPEAKER_02]: directly into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some innovation trends out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those cultivators who are just
starting out and can build their facility
[SPEAKER_00]: in a smart way, there's this cogen
technology that's been around for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: that combines heat with power.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was used originally to grow tomatoes
next to power plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't lose electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over transmission lines, it's all right
there together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've seen some interesting
cultivation facilities that have been set
[SPEAKER_00]: up from the beginning that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also take a closed loop approach
where you are recovering the water and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have elaborate water reprocessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're collecting all of that water or
the humidity that's being transpired off
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and you kind of have a closed
loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're already in a large indoor
grow, being able to retrofit that into a
[SPEAKER_00]: more innovative design is prohibitively
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to totally knock the cultivation
industry, because they have come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the biggest one was switching
over to LED lights from fluorescent
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cost more, again, to install,
but they last 10 times as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't emit heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spectrally tune them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They last 10 times longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most large grows now have
computer-controlled cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just like an on-off switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only used when it's required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can take the entire green
approach if you're growing outdoors with a
[SPEAKER_00]: closed loop where you chop the remaining
plant biomass and you put it back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or you use it to compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have a much healthier approach
to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that takes a lot more time and
input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your profits go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these states where there hasn't
been any limit on the number of licenses
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been issued for cultivation,
the competition is fierce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, you have these
horrendous reoccurring annual fees and the
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to compete with the black
market, especially in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, Hawaii, even in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the black market is still large.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see that as wrapped up into this
entire problem of what is the real cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take that into account.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you pointed out earlier,
the black market is certainly not immune
[SPEAKER_02]: to some of these environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though they may be growing outdoors,
they have a whole other set of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you sort of touched on this a little
bit, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forgive me if I'm putting you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you were to start a new cultivation
operation, what would sort of be the ideal
[SPEAKER_02]: setup in terms of limiting the
environmental impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you could grow in a green
environment, in a greenhouse, if whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: state you were in, if it was allowed to
grow in greenhouses, I mean, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least you're taking advantage of
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to have grow lights or
minimal grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take advantage of the natural
ventilation system that greenhouses offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could have some type of water
stream recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're recycling your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always thought there's these grows
dump so many nutrients into their growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually it just goes into the sewage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's like no reclamation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most sewage treatment plants,
water treatment plants don't have a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: reclaim those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads to the common problem of
algal blooms downstream of agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is something, this is a sin
that's not limited to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's been a problem with
agriculture for a long time is capturing
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff and these high levels of nutrients
that the plants just aren't able to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume because of over-application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something else that people,
growers are getting smarter about is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually monitoring the amount of
nutrients that plants are using so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not over-fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one of the other things you
touched on too, is that part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: problem is that, you know, cannabis
cultivation has become hyper localized
[SPEAKER_02]: just because of the federal prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to imagine that once that,
once that goes away, then some
[SPEAKER_02]: enterprising cultivators going to find the
perfect environment to grow cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: this country and then just kind of
dominate the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we'll have big ag moving in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have some boutique greenhouse
farmers probably that curate specific
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that their clients want or have
unique attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we'll also continue to have
breeding efforts that will maximize some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lesser well-known secondary
metabolites that this plant makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, in large part, it will move into
big recognized ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've seen, I mean, it's already
happening in the hemp world pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think that will be the
evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully those small boutique
grows will really kind of be committed to
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainable type of agricultural
processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully that will kind of limit this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a good segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about these smaller growers
and kind of maybe growing up the more
[SPEAKER_02]: lesser known cannabinoids and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I wanted to talk with
you about was an article that I had read
[SPEAKER_02]: on cannabis science and technology,
which was titled Making Sense of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Strains Through Chemometrics in Review,
something that you had authored with
[SPEAKER_02]: Philippe Henry, who's another friend of
medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wondered if you could, we could talk
a bit about that and maybe a good place to
[SPEAKER_02]: start is to kind of explain kind of what
is chemometrics and how can that be kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of applied to helping people make sense of
the various numbers of strains out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to say that one of the reasons I
got involved in cannabis testing was to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring transparency to the end user because
it was so obvious to me that the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: naming was just ridiculous and that even
Indica and Sativa basically had not had no
[SPEAKER_00]: defensible scientific meaning anymore and
strain names had nothing, was nothing more
[SPEAKER_00]: than branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I set out to demonstrate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was when I was running Digipath Labs
in Las Vegas and we had taken in enough
[SPEAKER_00]: samples at the beginning that we had 400
different named strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw the chemical profile data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chemometrics is just looking at the
chemical profiles for plants and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: based on whatever analyte groups you're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the good fortune of Nevada
including terpenes as well as cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: for chemical profiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly believed that the
cannabinoid profile combined with the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profile makes up the chemometric,
the fingerprint of that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we showed that if we just looked at
cannabinoid profiles, 97% of all those
[SPEAKER_00]: strains from the Vegas area were
identical, meaning they were all drug type
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all high THC because for
whatever misinformed reason, consumers of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis value cannabis products based on
how high the THC content is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very few growers at that time in Vegas
and even today were growing CBD dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were all high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did the same analysis on the
terpene profile across 19 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And showed that they clustered into three
different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then working with medicinal genomics,
we genotyped about 90 of those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Philippe was able to identify 14 SNPs
through that data that we could also use
[SPEAKER_00]: to assign a terpene cluster for any given
strain that we had selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it clearly showed that terpenes were
more informative if you wanted to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: some order to all of these strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And subsequent groups have done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Rousseau and Mark Lewis have done
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other people who have
suggested very similar things about the
[SPEAKER_00]: value of clustering based on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, terpenes are the sensory
perception you have when you smell
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cannabinoids have no odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're perceiving that strain through
the combination of volatile organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are largely the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that particular strain produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's more, we now know that terpenes
are physiologically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm a firm believer that you
have to know what the terpenes are because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually the terpenes that impart the
subtlety that users perceive between
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if you could give maybe
a little bit of a primer for maybe the
[SPEAKER_02]: uninitiated, our podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to think we have a wide range of
folks who are at various levels in their
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you did a pretty good job of
laying out the difference between
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe explain like I'm five sort of
explanation would be in order here before
[SPEAKER_02]: we get too deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so from a chemical structural
standpoint, I mean, cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes are just a group of chemicals
that have isoprene, a five carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: structure as their building block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can get linked together so they
can be mono terpenes, di terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: sesquiterpenes, so they can get bigger and
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both made and collect in the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is making the terpenes as
either to attract certain pollinators or
[SPEAKER_00]: repel certain insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants don't move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they make these volatile organic
compounds as a way to communicate with
[SPEAKER_00]: their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the organisms, insects and predators
or attractants that are in their
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because you can just smell terpenes
and you can then measure them in your
[SPEAKER_00]: bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're bringing them into your body
through receptors in your olfactory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they travel throughout your
body, we now know that those same
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors exist in other organs of your
body, which gives evidence that they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually perform a physiological function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that more than anything from
animal studies, and the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors that they bind to are a part of
the glutamate, NMDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all sedative by and large in the
human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're binding to these
neurotransmitter systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to see it, you know,
very simplistically that the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system is the big
overarching regulator of neuro excitatory
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dopamine response, and then underneath
that you have the terpenes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: binding to these other secondary,
but extremely prevalent neuro excitatory
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, you know, there's some people
like the entourage effect term and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't, but clearly these groups of
chemicals are working synergistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think it's well,
proven that the more you purify any one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids and remove it from these
other secondary metabolites that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: makes, the less of a beneficial effect you
have because you've like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: taken it out of its chemical environment
that it more normally operates in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after doing CanMed for five years now,
I think we've seen plenty of evidence to
[SPEAKER_02]: support the idea of the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately for the consumer,
they're not really, they're not often kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of privy to that information, either
because the state doesn't require them to
[SPEAKER_02]: test for terpenes or it's only a few of
the major ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can imagine that's a huge problem for
folks when they're really trying to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out the product that's gonna work for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's, there's a huge gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be an informed educational
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I tried to do that through
the dispensary owners in Vegas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, everybody falls back to,
well, what's the percent THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For whatever reason, that's just a minor
mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like how we got into this crazy
mindset that fat is bad and that you
[SPEAKER_00]: should have a low fat diet or that salt is
bad and you shouldn't have salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just ridiculous because we need
to consume fats and actually moving toward
[SPEAKER_00]: low fat diets has probably led to some of
the mental health issues we have because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's highly important to take in fats and
certain types of fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to have salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they've restricted salt so much in
some retirement facilities that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: now giving the people who live their salt
tablets because you need salt for your
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, these extreme viewpoints
that somehow get out there and are
[SPEAKER_00]: promoted are just erroneous and it just
takes too much time to undo them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is there any way that a consumer
kind of absent having a good laboratory
[SPEAKER_02]: result saying that the terpene
concentrations can sort of at least make
[SPEAKER_02]: an educated guess?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they just follow their nose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a reliable way to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so yeah, actually that's what we've
all been left to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to figure this out on our own
and particularly if you're not overly
[SPEAKER_00]: curious and researching things online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at least now there are sources of
information online.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go on to Leafly and if you have
been buying, say, Gorilla Glue and you
[SPEAKER_00]: like that strain, you can go and look it
up and you can see what are those terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can find other products that
have those terpenes but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first step is to educate people that
terpenes are contributing to the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological outcome of consuming that
particular strain or product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, now we see and now that a
lot of the producers have kind of jumped
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the terpene bandwagon for good or
bad, they're adding terpenes back into
[SPEAKER_00]: products and just like THC, too much of a
good thing is not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had seen extremely high levels of
terpenes in certain vape cartridges and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's just not right to just
indiscriminately be adding them and this
[SPEAKER_00]: comes back to another big problem within
the industry is that there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement to list the additives that are
going into these extracts and I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: should definitely be a requirement,
particularly if you're in a state where
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene analysis isn't required,
then the testing lab would never even see
[SPEAKER_00]: that and, you know, we kind of got into
that issue when some of the black market
[SPEAKER_00]: was adding vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of harm can be done because
there's a big difference if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: ingesting a terpene or rubbing a terpene
on your body versus inhaling it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we desperately need some oversight as
to what is going into these extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high concentration vape cartridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's an interesting point because
if I understand correctly, the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: levels are usually quite low, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like fractions of a percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're usually in flour,
you know, two to four percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can imagine that, you know,
if you're adding them to a vape cartridge,
[SPEAKER_02]: they could be much higher than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to your point, sort of what's the
effect of that or, you know, issues that
[SPEAKER_02]: come with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these concentrates are so pure and
so sticky and they need to be diluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now all of a sudden it turns out
terpenes are a very effective diluent to
[SPEAKER_00]: dilute the product because light dissolves
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terpenes are a good dilution component
for concentrated cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think anything above five
percent is not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had seen terpene concentrations as high
as 26, 25 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know because, oh,
nobody's ever done a study about,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, you know, is it a good idea to
vaporize and inhale terpenes at that
[SPEAKER_00]: level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a good topic for a KMED
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all right, Cindy, I want to be
respectful of your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're kind of coming up on the end
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before I let you go, I wanted to kind
