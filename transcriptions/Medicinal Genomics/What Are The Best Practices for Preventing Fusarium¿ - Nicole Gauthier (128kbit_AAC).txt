[SPEAKER_00]: So what about prevention?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the best practices for preventing
Fusarium in different growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the million dollar question,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we know about Fusarium griminiarum
is the most common species that's causing
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium head blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I say Fusarium griminiarum,
that's kind of the big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we know about Fusarium griminiarum
and other head blight and producing
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium, we know from wheat and barley
and cereals and corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we base a lot of things off of that
until we can generate our own data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in wheat, so I'm going to give you a
life cycle because, you know, nerdy
[SPEAKER_01]: pathologists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in wheat, wheat is a cool season crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium comes in, it really kind of
infects during enthesis, which is when
[SPEAKER_01]: that anther is kind of poking out of that
wheat flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when infection occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Kentucky, for example, that's
happening in May.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're harvesting wheat in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got a hemp crop that really
is not going in until July in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time hemp starts flowering and
is ultra susceptible to Fusarium
[SPEAKER_01]: infection, it's July, August.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we having this two month or
more division between that wheat infection
[SPEAKER_01]: and that hemp infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what our research has told us is that
in fields where there was wheat or near
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat, we have a lot higher incidence of
disease and toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot more Fusarium griminiarum
when there was wheat in the vicinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're finding out now is that
wheat cover crops, even though they were
[SPEAKER_01]: terminated before they flowered,
are still inducing a much higher amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't remember your question now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're trying to figure
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are all the roles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do know about Fusarium,
again, from the cereal grains research is
[SPEAKER_01]: that those spores, those canidia,
can get really high up into the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can move very long distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No greenhouse is safe if you've got a
vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the closer we are, that proximity to
any wheat or any other any other host
[SPEAKER_01]: plant seems to be really inducing a higher
level of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is there any sort of sprays or
bioagents that can be applied to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent an infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, so I'm going to back up just
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we don't have any conventional
fungicides or pesticides labeled for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we definitely don't for high THC
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have any products anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of organics, we've been looking
at a lot of biologicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, we're not finding anything
that is that is effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few years of field studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying lots of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're throwing a lot of things to see what
sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just don't think we're getting
anything right now.
So we're just going to have to wait and
see.
OK, so we're going to have to wait and
see.
