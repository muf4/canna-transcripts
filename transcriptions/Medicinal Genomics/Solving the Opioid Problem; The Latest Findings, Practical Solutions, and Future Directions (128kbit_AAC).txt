[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, Deb, for the introduction
on the opioid problem, the background,
[SPEAKER_03]: which hopefully will set the stage for a
nice conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: My goal for this panel and this
conversation is to bring together people
[SPEAKER_03]: that are on the front lines of clinical
practice, people that are doing research,
[SPEAKER_03]: both in experimental settings and
epidemiologic research, and to inform each
[SPEAKER_03]: other how to best move forward to solve
this problem that's in all of our faces
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's touching all of our lives,
either directly or indirectly,
[SPEAKER_03]: the opioid problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll begin with some introductions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Julia Arnsten, two down for me,
is a professor of medicine, epidemiology,
[SPEAKER_03]: and population health and psychiatry and
behavioral sciences at Albert Einstein
[SPEAKER_03]: College of Medicine and chief of the
Unified Division of General Internal
[SPEAKER_03]: Medicine in the Department of Medicine at
Einstein and Montefiore.
[SPEAKER_03]: She has her MPH from Harvard School of
Public Health and is an expert in
[SPEAKER_03]: delivering effective medical care to
vulnerable populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: She has recently moved into the medical
cannabis world, and I'm so excited to hear
[SPEAKER_03]: about her experience with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Directly next to me we have Dr. Ziva
Cooper, an associate professor of
[SPEAKER_03]: neurobiology and psychiatry at Columbia
University Medical Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was a co-author of the National
Academies of Sciences Engineering and
[SPEAKER_03]: Medicine report last year on the health
effects of cannabis, and she is the
[SPEAKER_03]: president of an international study group
investigating drugs as reinforcers,
[SPEAKER_03]: and she has many other distinctions.
[SPEAKER_03]: She researches the effects of psychoactive
substances in human laboratory using
[SPEAKER_03]: double-blind placebo control methods,
and her work, which has been funded by the
[SPEAKER_03]: NIH and the industry, focuses on
understanding biological and behavioral
[SPEAKER_03]: factors that influence therapeutic and
adverse effects of cannabis and other
[SPEAKER_03]: drugs like opioids and cocaine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Third down for me we have Dr. Caroline
McCallum.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a clinical instructor in the
Department of Medicine and associate
[SPEAKER_03]: member in the Department of Palliative
Care and an adjunct professor faculty of
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical sciences all at the
University of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the medical director of Greenleaf
Medical Clinic where she sees patients on
[SPEAKER_03]: the front lines of cannabinoid medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Her and Dr. Ethan Russo recently published
an excellent resource and article on
[SPEAKER_03]: medical cannabis administration and
dosing, and she's particularly interested
[SPEAKER_03]: in chronic pain, opioids, polypharmacy
reduction, pharmacovigilance, and
[SPEAKER_03]: impairment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the end we have Max Tuttleman,
who is an entrepreneur, venture
[SPEAKER_03]: capitalist, and philanthropist,
as well as the chairman and CEO of SMRT
[SPEAKER_03]: Industries, which is a portfolio of
companies operating in various aspects of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis and hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a program director of the Tuttleman
Foundation, a fellow at Thomas Jefferson
[SPEAKER_03]: University, where he is conducting
research on cannabis in opioid and alcohol
[SPEAKER_03]: withdrawal, and he's been actively working
to help curb the opioid epidemic,
[SPEAKER_03]: including improving access to naloxone in
Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm happy to have Max up here
because so often we can have a
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation that's all science and not
know how to ground that in reality and
[SPEAKER_03]: real change that affects people and saves
people's lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to bring this diverse panel
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm curious to start with you,
Julia, if I may, because you have a long
[SPEAKER_03]: career in academic medicine and clinical
practice, and I'm curious about your
[SPEAKER_03]: patient population and what your
experience has been like starting to see
[SPEAKER_03]: the use of cannabis in your clinic.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Dustin said, I've been in academic
medicine for a couple of decades,
[SPEAKER_17]: and prior to 2014, when medical cannabis
was legalized in New York State,
[SPEAKER_17]: where I live, my academic and research and
clinical career was largely focused on
[SPEAKER_17]: patients with opioid use disorder,
specifically how to help those patients to
[SPEAKER_17]: better adhere to medical treatments for
chronic diseases like HIV and hepatitis C
[SPEAKER_17]: and a whole host of other chronic diseases
that people who survive opioid use
[SPEAKER_17]: disorder go on to get.
[SPEAKER_17]: A couple things that I noticed about
cannabis during the years that I was
[SPEAKER_17]: focused on opioid use disorder were these.
[SPEAKER_17]: We did a number of studies where we looked
at how patients with opioid use disorder
[SPEAKER_17]: who used other drugs like cocaine or
benzodiazepines or alcohol or cannabis,
[SPEAKER_17]: how those other drugs affected their
ability to adhere to complex medical
[SPEAKER_17]: therapies for conditions like HIV.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the one drug of all of those that I
named that did not seem to impair
[SPEAKER_17]: adherence to other medical therapies was
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we looked at each of those drugs and
found that cocaine, alcohol,
[SPEAKER_17]: benzodiazepines all led to worse adherence
coupled with opioids, and that cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: didn't have that deleterious effect.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was an interesting observation.
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing that I noticed more in a
clinical sense is that patients who were
[SPEAKER_17]: using cannabis to treat chronic pain,
chronic pain from conditions like sickle
[SPEAKER_17]: cell disease or radiculopathy,
osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis,
[SPEAKER_17]: those patients seem to, and I don't have
data to support this, but seem to be less
[SPEAKER_17]: likely to go on to develop opioid use
disorder.
[SPEAKER_17]: So those were two observations that were
kind of floating around in my head.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then this big thing happened in New
York State, which is that medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: was made legal in 2014, we were the 30th
state.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I and my research group thought
this was a great opportunity to both
[SPEAKER_17]: expand practice and also to expand our
research focus.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we were able to put together a
medical cannabis practice within our
[SPEAKER_17]: safety net academic medical center
hospital.
[SPEAKER_17]: And our hospital is in the Bronx,
New York.
[SPEAKER_17]: You may be familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody from the Bronx?
[SPEAKER_17]: No, just me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so the Bronx is one of the nation's
poorest congressional districts.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nearly 90% of the patients in our hospital
are insured by Medicaid with or without
[SPEAKER_17]: Medicare.
[SPEAKER_17]: People are, the rates of opioid overdose
deaths and opioid use disorder,
[SPEAKER_17]: alcohol use are extraordinarily high and
have been for decades.
[SPEAKER_17]: The current focus on the opioid epidemic
is not new to us.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been focused on it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we saw this as an opportunity to
try to help patients who could not afford
[SPEAKER_17]: to go to a private doctor to have an
evaluation for medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_17]: to be able to be evaluated and to obtain
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we began this practice about a year
and a half ago and we've seen about 500
[SPEAKER_17]: patients.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the patients, just to get a flavor of
what it's like where we practice,
[SPEAKER_17]: the patients are overwhelmingly African
American or Latino or Latina, only about
[SPEAKER_17]: 15%.
[SPEAKER_17]: As I said, most of them have Medicaid or
Medicare and they're older for the most
[SPEAKER_17]: part and they have a huge host of chronic
medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_17]: A quarter have diabetes, almost half have
asthma, almost half have hypertension,
[SPEAKER_17]: 40% have depression.
[SPEAKER_17]: The medical comorbidities are very high.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the demand to see us for medical
cannabis is extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't keep up with the demand.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have waiting lists that are months out.
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we've done so far is we've looked
at this population of patients that we've
[SPEAKER_17]: seen and said, well, what happens to them
after they come to see us?
[SPEAKER_17]: And it turns out that only half of them
are able to go to the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_17]: purchase medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: The other half are unable to purchase it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we've called those patients and
asked them, how come you weren't able to
[SPEAKER_17]: purchase medical cannabis?
[SPEAKER_17]: And what they said was that they couldn't
afford it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so this is a heartbreaking situation.
[SPEAKER_17]: When I tell patients in practice,
this is what it's going to cost you,
[SPEAKER_17]: people outright break out in tears when
they're sitting and talking to me.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a tremendous, tremendous barrier
is the cost.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's really a huge social justice
issue.
[SPEAKER_17]: So if there's anything that I would like
to say to this group, it's to think about
[SPEAKER_17]: this as a social justice issue and a
health equity issue for patients like the
[SPEAKER_17]: ones that I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I'll stop there.
Thank you, Julia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have a question, a follow-up
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate you bringing attention
to the social justice part of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that the potential for home
cultivation and cottage industry in states
[SPEAKER_03]: that adopt medical cannabis laws is really
crucial, not to the exclusion of a more
[SPEAKER_03]: standardized dispensary or pharmaceutical
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm curious about the results that
you're seeing in the half of your patients
[SPEAKER_03]: that are accessing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's been surprising for you?
[SPEAKER_17]: So of the half that have been able to go
to the dispensary, what we've further
[SPEAKER_17]: found is that only about half of those are
able to continue with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So they'll come up with the money and
they'll get it one time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then they're really unable to sustain
the continued investment.
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we do see is that those who
sustain, the people who continue to take
[SPEAKER_17]: it are the people for whom it's helpful.
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's not data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me turn to you, Ziva.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as clinicians, in the practice of
helping people with chronic pain and
[SPEAKER_03]: opioids, we're often looking to the
preclinical literature that can maybe help
[SPEAKER_03]: inform what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And occasionally, we have the benefit of
seeing some human experimental data that
[SPEAKER_03]: really solidifies what the animal studies
are showing us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm wondering if you could summarize
the important findings from your excellent
[SPEAKER_03]: recent paper and some of the implications.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you so much for that lovely
introduction.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really wonderful to be here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dustin, I think that you summed up
what my primary interest is.
[SPEAKER_11]: As a pharmacologist, I first started off
doing my research in the preclinical
[SPEAKER_11]: laboratory using mice and rats and looking
at opioid analgesia as well as abuse
[SPEAKER_11]: liability.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I moved to look at cannabis and
cannabinoids in the clinical laboratory
[SPEAKER_11]: about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, looking at cannabis and
cannabinoids for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is obviously a topic that's been well
covered over the course of the two days.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what's interesting about this
particular topic, when we're thinking
[SPEAKER_11]: about the potential opioid-sparing effects
of cannabis and cannabinoids, that is can
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis actually be a substitute for
opioids for pain relief or can it help to
[SPEAKER_11]: reduce the dose of opioid needed to
achieve pain relief and therefore decrease
[SPEAKER_11]: the adverse effects of opioids,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: You think lower dose of opioids decrease
adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_11]: So at the time when I was designing the
study, I was really pulling on this very
[SPEAKER_11]: strong preclinical literature that has
only grown over time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we see in mice, rats, and
non-human primates that when you combine a
[SPEAKER_11]: dose of a CB1 receptor agonist like THC,
in fact THC, that isn't usually pain
[SPEAKER_11]: relieving with a very low dose of an
opioid that isn't pain relieving,
[SPEAKER_11]: and you put them together, you see robust
synergy.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you see this profound pain relieving
effect, but you don't see a increase in
[SPEAKER_11]: the adverse effects that are associated
with the opioids.
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are very encouraging findings.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the preclinical literature,
at the same time what was happening when I
[SPEAKER_11]: was doing these studies in the human
laboratory to replicate what we see in
[SPEAKER_11]: rats and mice, there was an explosion of
research demonstrating that in medical
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis states, there are reduced opioid
fatalities.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are reduced prescriptions of certain
opioids, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And so there's state-level evidence,
in addition to the anecdotal evidence that
[SPEAKER_11]: we're hearing today, that cannabis can
actually help to drive down the use of
[SPEAKER_11]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what I set out to do was do a
double-blind placebo-controlled study
[SPEAKER_11]: where I combined smoked cannabis with a
very small dose of an opioid to see if we
[SPEAKER_11]: can see the synergy.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you can combine the two, do you get
profound pain relief without a
[SPEAKER_11]: potentiation of the adverse effects?
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's unique, I think, because it's a
very controlled setting.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not using a pain population.
[SPEAKER_11]: I look at a pain response to a painful
stimulus that I am exposing patients to.
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully, these findings will
generalize to larger clinical populations
[SPEAKER_11]: of chronic pain patients, something that I
think that the folks at Einstein are
[SPEAKER_11]: working on today.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this type of model, where you use a
double-blind placebo-controlled setting,
[SPEAKER_11]: you can look at different types of
cannabinoids, and you can look at
[SPEAKER_11]: different modes of administration.
[SPEAKER_11]: Smoked, obviously, has limited clinical
therapeutic effects.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we're starting a study looking at
vaporized cannabis with THC and
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabidiol, and the two together,
to see if we can see that same
[SPEAKER_11]: opioids-bearing properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a follow-up question for you,
Ziva.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really appreciate your critical
thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that you've approached this
issue critically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the causes, I should say,
of the opioid problem were claims made by
[SPEAKER_03]: the pharmaceutical industry of great
safety and great efficacy, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: misinformation, perhaps we could even call
it propaganda, directed at the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I really want to avoid repeating
that mistake with cannabis, because it can
[SPEAKER_03]: do some things, and there's some things
that it might not do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with all that background, I'm curious,
Ziva, if you could tell not only the
[SPEAKER_03]: scientific community, but also
policymakers anything about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would it be?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the first thing is that it
definitely appears that cannabis and
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoids have a great deal of
potential promise to help reduce the
[SPEAKER_11]: opioid burden, whether it's a substitute
or it's an adjunct to opioids.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is imperative on us as a community
where we care for patients and guide
[SPEAKER_11]: scientific research that we have to be as
objective as possible and understand that
[SPEAKER_11]: when we're looking at cannabis,
it is a medication and it is a medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we should be looking both at the
positive effects.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is very important.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in order for it to gain legitimacy,
we have to be able to demonstrate that the
[SPEAKER_11]: adverse effects are minimal.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've already gone through this this
morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: We know the adverse effects are minimal.
[SPEAKER_11]: But as we saw with Epidiolex studies,
when you combine cannabidiol with other
[SPEAKER_11]: therapeutics, it affects metabolism of
commonly prescribed therapies.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is one area that we do need
some rigorous pharmacokinetic and
[SPEAKER_11]: pharmacodynamic research.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really important when I come to
these meetings and I hear about patient
[SPEAKER_11]: experiences and I hear about PEA and I
hear about cannabidiol and I hear about
[SPEAKER_11]: the range of other cannabinoids that you
pioneers are using right now, that is very
[SPEAKER_11]: helpful for me as a researcher who wants
to do the rigorous placebo studies to
[SPEAKER_11]: demonstrate that these effects can be
replicated and to demonstrate the clinical
[SPEAKER_11]: effectiveness to hopefully help guide
patient care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then back to you, Julia, just for a
quick follow up, since Ziva brought up the
[SPEAKER_03]: epidemiologic associations, and I know
you've been an author on several of those
[SPEAKER_03]: papers, could you offer our audience a
quick summary on what we're seeing in
[SPEAKER_03]: populations that have access to medical
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick summary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in general.
[SPEAKER_17]: Could you be a little more specific?
[SPEAKER_17]: A quick summary about what?
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, actually I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, go for it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the literature on patients with
access to medical cannabis, for the most
[SPEAKER_17]: part, comes from patients that have access
to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so there's a lot of papers that have
been published that are surveys or even
[SPEAKER_17]: longitudinal studies, cohort studies,
of patients who have been getting medical
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis from medical cannabis
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_17]: And those patients are demonstrating
benefit, great benefit.
[SPEAKER_17]: They have reductions in pain.
[SPEAKER_17]: They have reduced use of opioid
medications.
[SPEAKER_17]: They have reduced use of benzodiazepine
medications.
[SPEAKER_17]: They have reduced use of over-the-counter
medications for pain.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this has been shown in a whole lot of
surveys and also in a number of kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: what we think of as ecological studies,
so studies that are derived from
[SPEAKER_17]: state-level databases of all prescriptions
written that were paid for by Medicaid or
[SPEAKER_17]: Medicare.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we've seen that.
[SPEAKER_17]: What we haven't seen is who needs access
to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, what's happened to them,
like the patients that we're seeing,
[SPEAKER_17]: who we would like to have on medical
cannabis but are unable to be on it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we really have kind of a,
it's a bias in the data that we've
[SPEAKER_17]: collected.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's great data, but it tells one part of
the story.
[SPEAKER_17]: It tells a story about people who are
going to dispensaries and are continuing
[SPEAKER_17]: to take medical cannabis and are having
tremendous impact from it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree, what we need to have are
randomized controlled trials to
[SPEAKER_17]: demonstrate efficacy.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that becomes harder and harder to do
the more that products are available to
[SPEAKER_17]: people in a variety of ways.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's really a difficult balance that
we're trying to strike between making
[SPEAKER_17]: products available to people because
people shouldn't live in pain.
[SPEAKER_17]: People should have access to cannabis as
medicine.
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time, we want to establish
the efficacy and the evidence base for
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis in specific conditions.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, what might be the best
combination of cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_17]: for fibromyalgia, for radiculopathy,
for inflammatory arthritis?
[SPEAKER_17]: How are we going to know that if we're not
able to enroll people in trials and
[SPEAKER_17]: conduct a rigorous double-blind
placebo-controlled trial?
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the next one is for Caroline.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my clinic, I work with about eight
other doctors and nurse practitioners,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're often standing around at the end
of the day, still eight years,
[SPEAKER_03]: nine years after I've opened the practice,
we're still amazed by what we see,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially when it comes to the sparing
effect of cannabis on other drugs,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially opioids and benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering, Caroline, if you could
paint the picture of what you're seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: now working with cannabis and maybe how
that contrasts to before you started
[SPEAKER_03]: working with cannabis in the treatment of
pain patients, and you can cover successes
[SPEAKER_03]: and failures.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dustin, and it's such a
pleasure to be here with such a great
[SPEAKER_13]: panel.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I did work in four different pain
clinics, and I did some addiction before I
[SPEAKER_13]: moved into working with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: It took me a little bit of convincing by
my patients, but certainly I did see a lot
[SPEAKER_13]: of side effects.
[SPEAKER_13]: Side effects with opioids and other
medications that we commonly use for
[SPEAKER_13]: chronic pain, such as anti-inflammatories,
antidepressants, I'm trying to think of
[SPEAKER_13]: others, so tricyclics, and gabapentinoids,
and certainly patients actually found that
[SPEAKER_13]: they were less functional, and sometimes
they wanted to be in pain instead of have
[SPEAKER_13]: the pain managed but be foggier.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I find when I use cannabis with
opioids is that patients find that they
[SPEAKER_13]: need less opioids.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Dustin and I will frequently comment on
increasing the therapeutic index.
[SPEAKER_13]: So cannabis makes opioids safer,
and patients naturally tend to reduce
[SPEAKER_13]: their dose on their own, which was really
surprising because I've worked in clinics
[SPEAKER_13]: where we've tried to reduce opioid tapers
very slowly, and it's very challenging.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even a 10% reduction or a 5% reduction a
week can be very painful, and the way
[SPEAKER_13]: patients are in withdrawal can be really
quite horrible.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when patients are in withdrawal,
that can look like sweating, they can be
[SPEAKER_13]: nauseous, irritability, insomnia,
they can just have so many side effects.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what I find is when I use cannabis
with opioids, patients actually find that
[SPEAKER_13]: they, I don't want to say easily come off
their opioids, but it's actually something
[SPEAKER_13]: they do on their own before I even see
them in follow-up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I try to encourage them to come back to me
so we can organize a taper together so
[SPEAKER_13]: that they feel supported because education
is so important to understand what
[SPEAKER_13]: withdrawal could look like.
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're already starting to do this on
their own without my help, which can be
[SPEAKER_13]: good and bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that that's really a very
clear signal that there's something quite
[SPEAKER_13]: special about that combination.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when patients come off opioids,
they actually say to me, you're right,
[SPEAKER_13]: that wasn't really helping me function any
better.
[SPEAKER_13]: And initially they thought opioids were
helping, but unfortunately over time,
[SPEAKER_13]: their doses just kept increasing and
increasing without a lot more improvement,
[SPEAKER_13]: unfortunately, and just more side effects.
[SPEAKER_13]: So certainly this is something I'm so
passionate about.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was a pharmacist before I did medicine,
and I'm now undoing all these medications
[SPEAKER_13]: and working on drug holidays, which is
almost the opposite of what I used to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I feel I've really come full circle,
and cannabis has been such a teacher in
[SPEAKER_13]: that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to chime in for a minute
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I observed the same thing when I
started practicing, was patients coming
[SPEAKER_03]: back and telling me that they started
breaking their opioid tablets in half
[SPEAKER_03]: because they were too strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: They simply felt too strong when they took
them together with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, Ziva,
but I think in your paper, when you ask
[SPEAKER_03]: people about likability in the six
different conditions, they preferred the
[SPEAKER_03]: two and a half milligrams of oxycodone
plus cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the five milligrams, that actually was
more likable, that lower dose of
[SPEAKER_03]: oxycodone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what Dustin is alluding to is one of
the things that I look at, in addition to
[SPEAKER_11]: the pain relieving effects of the
combination of cannabis and opioids,
[SPEAKER_11]: is also abuse liability.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the idea is that if you are increasing
the pain relieving effects of the opioid,
[SPEAKER_11]: you want to make sure that you're not
increasing abuse liability, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what we found, and it's preliminary
data, is we found small and modest
[SPEAKER_11]: increases in subjective responses related
to this small dose of an opioid that
[SPEAKER_11]: doesn't normally produce a good effect on
its own.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you combine it with cannabis,
you do see some increase in good effect,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's modest.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's an important point to raise,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So patients do often do this on their own,
and now there's some data to back it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to go back to you, Caroline,
because we often see these incredible
[SPEAKER_03]: results, and we tend to focus on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious if you can paint a picture of
some of the patients that are using
[SPEAKER_03]: opioids where you add cannabis that maybe
don't get these impressive results.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are those challenges, and how are you
addressing them?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to think how many I have that
haven't had improvement.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you're right, it's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I have a biased population in the
sense that when they're coming to seek
[SPEAKER_13]: help, and I know Dustin, we've talked
about this before, they're very motivated.
[SPEAKER_13]: So certainly, they really want to reduce
their opioids.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's usually the first words out of their
mouth when they come and see me is,
[SPEAKER_13]: one of my goals is to come down on my
opioids.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I have patients that are very
motivated to begin with their high
[SPEAKER_13]: functioning, I definitely find that that
certainly helps reduce their doses.
[SPEAKER_13]: But even in those, I'm trying to think
that haven't reduced their opioid doses.
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly, the opioid doses have not
escalated, so they've stayed the same.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel that the side effects of the
opioids may have also been helped.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to think if there's any other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll chime in for a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that I think about a lot
because private practices that focus on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis medicine so often do have this
selection bias where patients are coming
[SPEAKER_03]: in motivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I suspect that's a little different
than your practice, Julia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basic principle in many healing arts is
the need for an exchange.
[SPEAKER_03]: For giving something in order to receive
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of your patients are probably
paying almost nothing for your services.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm curious about their level of
motivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, maybe you can speak to this,
Caroline, the difference between a chronic
[SPEAKER_03]: pain population and a more opiate
addiction or problematic use population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there's broad overlaps there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before I let you answer this,
I just want to point out to the audience
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's been one paper and another
abstract published in the last six months
[SPEAKER_03]: that looked at self-efficacy, which I
think is partially what we're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about here.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people have this can-do attitude and
they feel like they want to use cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: as a tool to improve themselves and
they're willing to participate in their
[SPEAKER_03]: own self-improvement, it looks from this
early observational data like they're more
[SPEAKER_03]: likely to be successful in using cannabis
to do so versus those with low
[SPEAKER_03]: self-efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we have to take care of everyone,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that have high and low
self-efficacy and I suspect that
[SPEAKER_03]: addressing that deficit may be a real key
component to getting better results with
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these challenging patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, Caroline, if you could comment
on pain, addiction, problematic use,
[SPEAKER_03]: the overlap there and any distinctions
you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so I think getting back to good
clinical practice and hence the reason
[SPEAKER_13]: Ethan and I put together the paper that we
did on how to use medical cannabis and how
[SPEAKER_13]: to dose appropriately.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that if you use the right
combinations of chemo virus, if you're
[SPEAKER_13]: using doses that we feel are helpful and
Dustin's a big proponent of low dose uses
[SPEAKER_13]: of cannabis, I think that that's where we
can see a lot of benefit without seeing
[SPEAKER_13]: side effects.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have patients that come to me that
may border on a history of addiction and
[SPEAKER_13]: they may be using higher doses of cannabis
than I would typically be using.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a lot of times we need to
educate on that you can get better results
[SPEAKER_13]: with less, which is very hard to initially
convince them of.
[SPEAKER_13]: But a lot of the times they have not been
using CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you're buying it on the street and
recreationally, high concentrate stabs and
[SPEAKER_13]: other various routes can frequently be
used and I don't personally find them to
[SPEAKER_13]: be as medically beneficial.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do encourage them to transition to
oils, which are going to last longer,
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe up to six hours at a time using a
nice balance of extra CBD or more CBD than
[SPEAKER_13]: THC and to really focus on not chasing
their symptoms, but preventing their
[SPEAKER_13]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_13]: So looking at the idea of like long acting
and then using short acting medications
[SPEAKER_13]: where needed.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think there's a bit of education
there and a lot of these patients with a
[SPEAKER_13]: history of maybe some addiction and
undertone are really looking for instant
[SPEAKER_13]: gratification and we do offer some groups
in my clinic.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we offer a yoga group, some mindfulness
meditation.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of this is self-awareness as
Dustin's mentioned because a lot of these
[SPEAKER_13]: patients really need to check in and
question why they're vaporizing or using
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis every hour, every two hours.
[SPEAKER_13]: It may be that there's underlining anxiety
that can be managed in another way.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I feel that we really need to use
multiple modalities and I always say that
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis is a great tool, but it's really
not going to do everything for patients
[SPEAKER_13]: and discussing expectations is really
important.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always recommend that patients journal
and I know Dustin does the same,
[SPEAKER_13]: that journaling and really seeing what
dose is that sweet spot is very important
[SPEAKER_13]: and sometimes we need to change up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it's CBD or THC and it's not
necessarily CBD and THC that may work for
[SPEAKER_13]: somebody else.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is an individualization that
needs to happen and I guess something I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: pretty passionate about, we've already
talked about opioid reduction,
[SPEAKER_13]: is I'm working to create a tool to see how
can we better use cannabis even just as an
[SPEAKER_13]: adjuvant to start and what's a worrisome
dose of opioid in the sense of what would
[SPEAKER_13]: be a good patient to start cannabis on,
especially for physicians I think that are
[SPEAKER_13]: not convinced that cannabis, they're just
unsure of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that if you've got a patient on 50
milligrams of morphine equivalent doses
[SPEAKER_13]: where we know there's significant increase
in morbidity and mortality, that's a dose
[SPEAKER_13]: where we absolutely should be considering
cannabis before going to a higher dose of
[SPEAKER_13]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_13]: So just trying to get some physicians feet
wet that may not otherwise be open to
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis when we've got patients that at
that point their risk of mortality is huge
[SPEAKER_13]: and in the US last year more than 42,000
people died of opioids.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's been more than a trillion
dollars spent on the opioid crisis from
[SPEAKER_13]: 2001 to 2017.
[SPEAKER_13]: So certainly that's really where I'm
trying to focus these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's your message for your colleagues
in medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about for policy makers?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had a room full of people that were
making and passing laws and you had their
[SPEAKER_03]: ear for one or two minutes, what would you
want them to know?
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we've touched on a lot of the
high-level concepts that cannabis is safer
[SPEAKER_13]: than opioids in terms of therapeutic
window.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one to a thousand instead of one to
five or one to twenty that we see with
[SPEAKER_13]: some of the opioids.
[SPEAKER_13]: That cannabis makes opioids safer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cannabis can help reduce opioid doses and
I think for me right now being in
[SPEAKER_13]: Vancouver in Canada we've just legalized
cannabis on October 17th.
[SPEAKER_13]: But unfortunately our medical bodies,
the Canadian Medical Association has
[SPEAKER_13]: really not been supportive of medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: They actually see that medical and
recreational they feel can merge together.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really have the next five years
where Health Canada is really looking to
[SPEAKER_13]: see the difference of how somebody can use
this as a medicine versus just using it
[SPEAKER_13]: recreationally.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's an area of huge concern for me
because my patients are very complicated.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're on a lot of medications.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_13]: They can experience a lot of side effects
and some of these populations are quite
[SPEAKER_13]: vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I really want to show that this isn't
something that's, I mean patients do use
[SPEAKER_13]: it on their own and do get benefit,
but certainly if we can find tune it and
[SPEAKER_13]: make it a medical, more medicalized I
guess, that I think that that's really
[SPEAKER_13]: where we should be focusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll open it to Julia or Ziva.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything to add if we were speaking to a
room full of policymakers and those in
[SPEAKER_03]: charge?
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean I think that the inconsistency with
the way in which cannabis is regulated in
[SPEAKER_17]: the United States from state to state
creates tremendous amounts of problems and
[SPEAKER_17]: that all stems from the federal ban.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the fact that it's as expensive as it
is, that insurance can't pay for it,
[SPEAKER_17]: that people can't use a credit card to pay
for it, you know creates terrible
[SPEAKER_17]: inequities and that would be my main
message is that we need to fix that.
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to make it available to everybody
and I think I just want to echo something
[SPEAKER_17]: that you said earlier.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know we do need to treat everyone,
even people who don't know that they want
[SPEAKER_17]: to be treated.
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to meet patients where they're at,
you know that's sort of a basic tenet of
[SPEAKER_17]: internal medicine, medicine, addiction
medicine and you know I think that you
[SPEAKER_17]: know the people in this room and people
who are interested in cannabinoid medicine
[SPEAKER_17]: really need to be making a better effort
to make cannabis accessible to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess the one thing that I can say
about policy is that as was just stated,
[SPEAKER_11]: the laws are really all over the map with
regards to the United States.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every state has different numbers of
indications for which people can be,
[SPEAKER_11]: can use cannabis and the types of cannabis
that are available because of these state
[SPEAKER_11]: laws and because of federal bans,
they're all over the place and so
[SPEAKER_11]: therefore it really does make gathering
data on a nationwide sample really
[SPEAKER_11]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_11]: So and I guess this goes to, this kind of
speaks to the federal ban but having some
[SPEAKER_11]: type of orchestrated policy across states
I think would be enormously helpful in
[SPEAKER_11]: helping to elucidate how cannabis and
cannabinoids can be used therapeutically,
[SPEAKER_11]: not just for pain but for all the other
indications, you know up to 35 indications
[SPEAKER_11]: that cannabis is used for across the
states and you know pain we've been
[SPEAKER_11]: tackling this issue with cannabis and
cannabinoids for a long time but there are
[SPEAKER_11]: other indications, for example anxiety,
PTSD and other indications mood disorders
[SPEAKER_11]: that are really important, substance use
disorders apart from opioids, alcohol,
[SPEAKER_11]: tobacco, benzodiazepine use disorder.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is critical, really critical areas of
research right now that would be helped if
[SPEAKER_11]: we had some type of streamlined approach
to how states were using or approaching
[SPEAKER_11]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much and I'll add that one
thing that we know about access to medical
[SPEAKER_03]: treatments is that monopoly and oligopoly
is used usually not good for patients and
[SPEAKER_03]: not good for the consumers in any way and
I think that as we move forward with
[SPEAKER_03]: medical cannabis, perhaps in a national
sense which would be a dream, I think we
[SPEAKER_03]: really have to continue to focus on
supporting home cultivation and cottage
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, not just for the local economic
development that it has to offer which is
[SPEAKER_03]: profound but also because cannabis is not
a single medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's such incredible diversity that
comes out of these artisanal marketplaces
[SPEAKER_03]: that can give us surprise discoveries
about how to best use cannabis or what
[SPEAKER_03]: parts of the plants are most useful and I
would really hate to see that squashed and
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm giving you all that message in
particular because even though you may not
[SPEAKER_03]: be policy makers, so often those of us in
the industry indirectly or directly affect
[SPEAKER_03]: policy and while there may be a lot of
potential for big companies in this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, I hope that all of you despite
your goals or in addition to your goals
[SPEAKER_03]: are willing to support home cultivation in
the cottage industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'd like to turn it to Max now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can have these great scientific
conversations, we can publish papers that
[SPEAKER_03]: show efficacy and harm reduction and all
sorts of other benefits and then so often
[SPEAKER_03]: public policy doesn't change for a variety
of reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a really tough question Max but
with your experience in philanthropy and
[SPEAKER_03]: social change, I'm wondering what can
scientists and clinicians do to actually
[SPEAKER_03]: make policy change a reality and save
lives and improve outcomes?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a great question Dustin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been recently actually thinking about
this a lot because I've been working on a
[SPEAKER_07]: project in Philadelphia to create a
supervised injection facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a little closer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been working on a project in
Philadelphia to create a supervised
[SPEAKER_07]: injection facility and part of what I've
been trying to do to that is, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: develop a research scope around that and
I've been working directly with the
[SPEAKER_07]: governor's office in Pennsylvania and
saying, you know, okay like how do you
[SPEAKER_07]: guys, what questions and data points do
you guys need to have like this
[SPEAKER_07]: successfully go through the state
legislator?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what do you guys need to show people?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's really, you know,
researchers trying to work really
[SPEAKER_07]: hand-in-hand with administrations and
different state administrations and
[SPEAKER_07]: municipal administrations and saying,
you know, how can we help you in the more
[SPEAKER_07]: of a like symbiotic relationship instead
of a like a hand-holding relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that there's so much disconnect
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even just thinking about it, I'm sure that
the four of us are interested in research
[SPEAKER_03]: questions that are just the best questions
based on science, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on our clinical practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe those aren't the best questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, maybe it's like you should
get maybe when's the last time you've
[SPEAKER_07]: called like your like state like
governor's office and said, hey,
[SPEAKER_07]: like what are the biggest problems you're
having?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, how could I as a researcher be
the most help to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think we need people like you in
the middle coming to us and saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: please study this, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's the role of philanthropy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of like the role I play.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so what do you have for us up here
as far as things that you think,
[SPEAKER_03]: questions that you think need answering by
scientists in order to help change policy
[SPEAKER_03]: around taking a chunk out of this opioid
epidemic?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think in terms of cannabis and
we're still so early on that like we don't
[SPEAKER_07]: even know what we don't know about this
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know what if the molecules that
we're all studying and looking into and
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking or being the like mechanism or
having the effect or really having the
[SPEAKER_07]: effect or are there new undiscovered
molecules that we don't even know about
[SPEAKER_07]: that could like be causing these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think really trying to understand
what the cannabis plan is and what the
[SPEAKER_07]: effects that it can have are really
crucial to start with.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe, you know, science has the
ability to take a long time and drags its
[SPEAKER_07]: feet a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if it's dragging its feet
or it just doesn't get the support it
[SPEAKER_07]: needs and it doesn't always get the
support it needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it doesn't get the funding it
needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, you know, here in the United
States, it's so restrictive.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, NIDA, any clinical research here
in the United States has to be done
[SPEAKER_07]: through NIDA.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like how restrictive is that to do,
you know, trying to show the positives of
[SPEAKER_07]: a drug through like a drug abuse clinic
and only being able to study the negatives
[SPEAKER_07]: of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So really, you know, just diving in and,
you know, looking for resources anywhere
[SPEAKER_07]: you can find them to do your research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to you, Ziva.
[SPEAKER_03]: What cautions do you have for us
clinicians that are kind of two feet in in
[SPEAKER_03]: this field of using cannabis to treat
people that are dependent on opioids?
[SPEAKER_11]: What caution?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a caution.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's when I think about how we are
all players in this experiment,
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that in order to demonstrate the
legitimacy, and I'm speaking to a crowd
[SPEAKER_11]: here that all understands that the
therapeutic potential of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm preaching to the choir.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are people who want to see the
data.
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to see the safety and
tolerability.
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to see efficacy.
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to see adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is absolutely imperative that there
is a dialogue between the clinicians,
[SPEAKER_11]: between you guys who are pioneers in the
field and the scientists and the people
[SPEAKER_11]: that are doing the randomized clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those substance use researchers who are
also interested in studying the
[SPEAKER_11]: therapeutic effects of cannabis over here,
despite the barriers.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's hard.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is really hard work to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is immensely gratifying when you
see that in compared to a placebo,
[SPEAKER_11]: you see these effects of cannabis and
cannabis, a particular type of cannabis or
[SPEAKER_11]: a route of administration or THC and CBD
one to one ratio or one to 20 ratio.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is immensely gratifying.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see it on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see the data.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's data that you can show to the
world, that you can submit to
[SPEAKER_11]: peer-reviewed journals.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the basis of immense changes
politically.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you see what happened with
Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now the DEA, and I know this is not
cannabidiol across the board, but the DEA
[SPEAKER_11]: has put that as schedule five.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what is that saying to the world about
how the DEA feels about cannabidiol in
[SPEAKER_11]: general?
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I know it's only Epidiolex that was
scheduled five, but this is a huge shift
[SPEAKER_11]: in public perception.
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened with Epidiolex is it's the
first indication for which a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: was approved by the FDA in close to 30
years.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is big.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's plant-derived.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's also huge.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess what I'm saying is that
increased dialogue between the clinicians,
[SPEAKER_11]: between the scientists, between the people
that want to do the randomized controlled
[SPEAKER_11]: trials and recognize the power of the
RCTs, they have immense power to be able
[SPEAKER_11]: to speak to the public and demonstrate
this is what we know the plant can
[SPEAKER_11]: actually do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, increased communication is what
we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Ziva.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, cannabis is so different from other
pharmaceutical drugs, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: In its incredibly broad dosing range and
all these different constituents that can
[SPEAKER_03]: change its effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's often used in the clinic not like
a drug, but in a very pragmatic approach
[SPEAKER_03]: where there's different delivery methods
and dosing strategies based on the
[SPEAKER_03]: individual's presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very much individualized medicine as
was mentioned earlier today by Heather
[SPEAKER_03]: Jackson.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm wondering, is there a way to
bring that into controlled studies?
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my main areas of research is
differences between males and females.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I know that's a big dichotomy here,
but it is getting towards precision
[SPEAKER_11]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at, we talked about differences of
efficacy of cannabinoids in the young
[SPEAKER_11]: population versus the elderly population
based on different indications,
[SPEAKER_11]: based on people that have never been
exposed to cannabinoids before versus
[SPEAKER_11]: chronic users or people who are using
other medications.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are subsets of populations that can
be, that should be studied with regards to
[SPEAKER_11]: understanding what are the therapeutic
windows of effects?
[SPEAKER_11]: How can we predict or what science can we
build to be able to predict outcome?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think with all the brains together,
we can put together a large data set where
[SPEAKER_11]: we can actually be able to determine this
dose of cannabidiol administered with this
[SPEAKER_11]: terpene administered in this way might be
most effective.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, this is the case with a lot of
pharmaceutical drugs as well is that one
[SPEAKER_11]: size doesn't fit all.
[SPEAKER_11]: It might be particularly amplified with
cannabis and cannabinoids, but this is an
[SPEAKER_11]: issue with a lot of drugs out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you look at the medications that
are used to treat depression or PTSD.
[SPEAKER_11]: A majority of people do not respond to a
lot of these drugs.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so why is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're working that out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Same thing with cannabis and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to open to the panel to ask or
tell Ziva anything for all three of you
[SPEAKER_03]: because you have her ear right now and
she's going to be doing this research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to start with an
observation that I've had in my clinic
[SPEAKER_03]: since you brought up sex differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe I'm seeing a trend, maybe any of
you could comment if you're seeing this as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, that women age 70 and older that are
on higher doses of opioids are less likely
[SPEAKER_03]: to get these profound results that I'm
seeing in the rest of my opioid using
[SPEAKER_03]: patient population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any thoughts on that,
Ziva?
[SPEAKER_11]: That is so interesting, Dustin.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you're seeing is that cannabis or
the cannabinoid that you're using isn't as
[SPEAKER_11]: effective for those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, they're less responsive to the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I start seeing a signal at a much
higher dose than expected compared to men
[SPEAKER_03]: of the same age or women of younger age.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they might start feeling the
cannabis and they're not breaking their
[SPEAKER_03]: tablets in half and they're not getting
this strong potentiating effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't across the board, but I think
this is a trend.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not to say that this isn't
effective in women.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to understand, A, mechanistically,
biologically, why isn't it effective?
[SPEAKER_11]: And B, what strategies can be utilized to
help amplify the therapeutic effects of
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis in this population.
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, so I have seen the same type
of thing in our population, younger
[SPEAKER_11]: participants and only cannabis using,
but we see this tolerance that has
[SPEAKER_11]: developed among women at a faster rate
than males to the pain relieving effects.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we should be aware of that because
when a woman comes in and she tries
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis or some type of cannabinoid and
she doesn't have an immediate response,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's not to say that they won't be
effective.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe a higher dose is needed.
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, looking at the other
types of, I don't know if you see in your
[SPEAKER_11]: same population if there's the same rates
of confusion or maybe anxiety among the
[SPEAKER_11]: women as the men, but it's also important
to look at those adverse effects as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caroline, Julia, or Max, anyone that wants
to see Vazir about informing her research
[SPEAKER_03]: or giving her questions that you think are
important for her to answer.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that one thing that's really
important for everyone to keep in mind is
[SPEAKER_17]: that there's a lot of space between opioid
use disorder and chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_17]: And in some cases, they overlap,
but they're not the same condition.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so some people who have chronic pain
develop opioid use disorder.
[SPEAKER_17]: And some people who have opioid use
disorder also have chronic pain,
[SPEAKER_17]: but they need to be thought about
separately and treated separately.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so when we think about using different
cannabinoids for treating chronic pain,
[SPEAKER_17]: that's one paradigm.
[SPEAKER_17]: And even chronic pain is a problematic
term because there's many different
[SPEAKER_17]: conditions that lead to chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_17]: And my thought when you were speaking,
Dustin, was, well, what condition are
[SPEAKER_17]: those older women coming in with?
[SPEAKER_17]: And are you effectively controlling for
all the potential confounders?
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they more likely to have fibromyalgia?
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they less likely to have neuropathy?
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it a condition-based issue?
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's a tangent.
[SPEAKER_17]: Three notes.
[SPEAKER_17]: The issue with opioid use disorder is
cannabis may alleviate some of the
[SPEAKER_17]: withdrawal symptoms if people are coming
down off their opioids.
[SPEAKER_17]: But we don't really have data to suggest
that cannabis is going to treat opioid use
[SPEAKER_17]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not going to occupy the same
receptor.
[SPEAKER_17]: Something has to occupy the opioid
receptors, either an agonist or an
[SPEAKER_17]: antagonist.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so what is the crossover at the
receptor level between the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_17]: system and the mu and kappa opioid
receptors that might potentially make
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis effective in treating either
opioid use disorder or opioid withdrawal
[SPEAKER_17]: symptoms?
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it's a wholly separate issue than
treating chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But perhaps not an agonist or an
antagonist, but an endogenous actor could
[SPEAKER_03]: be part of that treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the framework for treating opioid
use disorder with medication-assisted
[SPEAKER_03]: therapy, where there's this
non-pharmacologic component, is something
[SPEAKER_03]: that we need to model as we roll out
cannabis to that patient population.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just throw cannabis at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when cannabis is in the context of
education on how to use it in the optimal
[SPEAKER_03]: way, I think we're going to see much
better results.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me throw out one other idea.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before you do, just to clarify,
is this timeline, are there time for
[SPEAKER_03]: questions afterwards?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was under the impression we had
a full hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you mentioned medication-assisted
treatment for opioid use disorder.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we don't have enough providers who are
doing medication-assisted treatment for
[SPEAKER_17]: opioid use disorder.
[SPEAKER_17]: So please consider helping people in your
community to become buprenorphine
[SPEAKER_17]: providers and to treat opioid use disorder
with medication-assisted treatment.
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we can train those same providers to
use cannabinoid medicine as an adjunct
[SPEAKER_17]: while they're providing
medication-assisted treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caroline, any final comments?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd just like to mention about impairment.
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of looking at naive patients
versus regular chronic medical users on a
[SPEAKER_13]: day-to-day basis, I have some huge
concerns.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because in Canada, with legalization
especially, is going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_13]: trying to put everything on a drug level.
[SPEAKER_13]: So THC of so many nanograms per mil,
does that reflect impairment?
[SPEAKER_13]: And really looking to find what the best
test is going to be.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I personally feel it's probably going
to be a combination of some form of a
[SPEAKER_13]: physical test, neurocognitive testing,
instead of just using an isolated number
[SPEAKER_13]: which isn't really, it's going to be quite
difficult to compare.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the other point with impairment is
CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: We talk about CBD being non-intoxicating,
but psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, in some of the studies we've
noticed on pediatric seizures,
[SPEAKER_13]: that some of these children did have
fatigue.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the question is, is it because it's
a higher dose of CBD?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it a drug interaction?
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we really say that CBD has no
impairment?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm certainly using that in the daytime
for my patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: My patients who want to go to work,
but now there's some workplace issues,
[SPEAKER_13]: and they're wondering if they are impaired
or aren't impaired on CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would look to the researchers to see
if we can focus on that area, since my
[SPEAKER_13]: patients are now well enough to go back to
work.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if they can't use their cannabis,
how are they going to be able to do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Max, any final thoughts?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, first off, it's so great to be up
with all of you researchers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you so much for pushing
everything forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think just really working with your
state administrations could be very
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting, and asking them what needs to
be done, and what issues are you having in
[SPEAKER_07]: your marijuana programs that really need
to be addressed that could help you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: better the program and be a good model for
other states.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing that became very apparent to me
in some of my discussions with some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: high-ranking officials that were setting
up the state program in Pennsylvania is
[SPEAKER_07]: that they just had nothing to go on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they just picked from different states
what they thought was good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like at the end of the day,
they just don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think science, working with
policymakers, can really help us stay out
[SPEAKER_07]: of some very dangerous situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Max.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need one of you in at least
every state, because we're all busy in the
[SPEAKER_03]: clinic and in the lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not there at the state house
talking like you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please keep the lines of communication
open and help us make an impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks like now it's time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. McCallum, my question is for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazing work that you're doing in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm also from Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_14]: And my question is, we know that there's a
shortage of marijuana or cannabis at the
[SPEAKER_14]: moment.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looks like that's not going to
change anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the dispensaries, in Vancouver,
seem to be the ones that have all the
[SPEAKER_14]: information.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're being shut down.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess my question is, what do you see
in the future in terms of physicians and
[SPEAKER_14]: what you're going to be able to access
when we see everything being sold out on
[SPEAKER_14]: their websites?
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: So just there's a couple of points of
clarification there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So with legalization, even though it was
October 17th, not all the storefronts were
[SPEAKER_13]: open across Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, there was a bit of a time
management issue.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we got ahead of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_13]: So none of the storefronts are open in BC
and in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are going to take a few months to
open.
[SPEAKER_13]: Online sales are open.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is recreational purposes we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, the medical stream has been 100%
preserved.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can still write an authorization for
a patient.
[SPEAKER_13]: I fax it directly to one of the licensed
producers in Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the federally regulated growers.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's about 120 companies.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that supply of cannabis is preserved.
[SPEAKER_13]: My patients have not had any access
problems.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, the recreational market,
certainly on day one of sales,
[SPEAKER_13]: it was, like you're right, sold out in a
number of provinces.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm shocked they didn't see this coming.
[SPEAKER_13]: We know how much cannabis is being used in
BC, even though there's very few
[SPEAKER_13]: registered people using it especially.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the streams are separate.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we really need to show that there's
medical benefit to keep them separated.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I think all of the licensed
producers are going to be up in the ante.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that, I think supply will kind of
peter out.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is a little bit of a rush.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is really a fad.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the average consumer purchased
something like $200 or $300 worth of
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis on their first purchase.
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems to be that people were just very
excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, next question, please.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so Siva, what is the role of
functional MRI and pharmacogenomics in
[SPEAKER_09]: your business?
[SPEAKER_09]: What is your research?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not, those are not areas that I have
been invested in over the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're really important areas that
need to be integrated in these
[SPEAKER_11]: double-blind placebo-controlled studies.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dustin, do you ever do that in your
practice?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like maybe that would help you distinguish
what's going on with your older patients
[SPEAKER_09]: that aren't responding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly interesting ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're just kind of boots on the ground
and figuring out what to do with patients
[SPEAKER_03]: that have limited resources and ways that
help them the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we don't have that luxury.
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that probably is part of the
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joel, your question, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a primary care provider in Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did train at Lincoln Hospital in the
Bronx.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have had the worst cup of coffee in
New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: One question I have is, you know,
we talked about the difficulties we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And convincing other physicians of the
importance of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've run into that extensively in
Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any thoughts other than just offering
giving talks or meeting with physicians
[SPEAKER_04]: one-on-one to either get them to consider
becoming a recommending physician or
[SPEAKER_04]: referring patients?
[SPEAKER_03]: My best advice is to copy chart notes that
demonstrate success to the primary care
[SPEAKER_03]: and as many specialists as the patient
will allow you to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the conversation about cannabis
is bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's best brought up by the patient with
their doctor to kind of preserve that
[SPEAKER_03]: therapeutic relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patients are often cautious about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the results speak louder than
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when patients are going back to
their pain specialist or back to their
[SPEAKER_03]: primary, asking for less instead of more
of the opioid drug, and they're seeing a
[SPEAKER_03]: chart note from a responsible internist
like you that's documenting that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: following this patient medically,
I don't know what will speak louder than
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other comments?
[SPEAKER_17]: I think for us, there is a lot of
resistance and, you know, doctors,
[SPEAKER_17]: we're just an inherently conservative
bunch and fairly moralistic.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's kind of where you're starting
from.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so what I do around Einstein and
Montefiore is I just try to give a lot of
[SPEAKER_17]: Grand Rounds presentations to different
departments and to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: I try to be impeccable in the way that I
document things in EPIC, which is our
[SPEAKER_17]: electronic medical record, and get back to
physicians who are referring.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we put out some material like
promotional material.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not really promotional.
[SPEAKER_17]: It really is just reprints from what's on
the New York State Department of Health
[SPEAKER_17]: website, but kind of send it out to
certain key constituents like rheumatology
[SPEAKER_17]: and the Cancer Center Chronic Pain Program
that's interventional.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we now have a really, really,
in a short period of time, extremely
[SPEAKER_17]: active referral pipeline from those
places, you know, to our cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_17]: But putting yourself out there or finding
somebody who's very credible who can,
[SPEAKER_17]: if you have access to, being able to give
Grand Rounds or other CME kinds of
[SPEAKER_17]: lectures, you know, throughout the
different medical centers, that's been
[SPEAKER_17]: really effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, next question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one other short question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever thought about using a
partial agonist in those patients you're
[SPEAKER_04]: referring to, like partial opiate agonist
in combination with cannabis to reduce
[SPEAKER_04]: their sensitivity to the opiates?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't thought of that because most of
them are on high dose strong agonists,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so I'm not sure how I would make that
transition.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd like to talk with you more about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question, please.
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a very basic question.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've recently spent some time in
Kensington, Pennsylvania, which has been
[SPEAKER_18]: decimated by the opiate crisis.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm wondering, you know, 80% of the
people that are addicted to opiates were
[SPEAKER_18]: originally prescribed opiates by doctors.
[SPEAKER_18]: So in your experience, as physicians,
as scientists, as professors, as
[SPEAKER_18]: advocates, why are doctors still
prescribing opiates when 115 people are
[SPEAKER_18]: dying per day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, before I answer your question,
I'm sorry, I have to take this opportunity
[SPEAKER_03]: to take responsibility as a profession for
creating this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds to a lot of people like maybe
it's a heroin problem or a drug abuse
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But its origin is really a medical
problem, a problem that happens in the
[SPEAKER_03]: doctor's office.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's clearly our responsibility to
change that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one of the most important
things is to get another tool into the
[SPEAKER_03]: hands of doctors that are managing
patients with chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because right now, their tools aren't very
effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think the answer to the last
question about educating clinicians about
[SPEAKER_03]: using cannabis therapeutically is a great
place to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anyone else wants to comment?
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's on us.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you know, we did it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we can say we were adduced by Purdue
Pharma, but you know, we did it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now we have to undo it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think that there are a lot of
doctors that are really trying very hard,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, to not prescribe opioids.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a big movement in the surgical
fields called ERAS, Enhanced Recovery
[SPEAKER_17]: After Surgery, in which surgeons are
trying to use anything other than opioids
[SPEAKER_17]: to manage people after surgery from IV
acetaminophen, getting out of bed like an
[SPEAKER_17]: hour after surgery, running around the
hallway, you know, really sort of
[SPEAKER_17]: mobilizing people and are reporting very
good outcomes from that.
[SPEAKER_17]: So where we turn very quickly to opioids,
you know, to manage pain 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_17]: 15 years ago, we're really trying to not
do that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the flip side of that,
the bad side, is that we're seeing a lot
[SPEAKER_17]: of people who were being managed by
physicians that were maybe not so
[SPEAKER_17]: reputable.
[SPEAKER_17]: And those practices have been closed.
[SPEAKER_17]: And patients are being cut off very
quickly from opioid medications that they
[SPEAKER_17]: were on for years.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that puts them at tremendous risk for
overdose, because then they get something,
[SPEAKER_17]: fentanyl on the street or carfentanil or
something else that's going to be lethal.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have to deal with that,
too.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that physicians, I mean,
the CDC has put out guidelines
[SPEAKER_17]: recommending tapering, you know,
of everybody.
[SPEAKER_17]: And physicians are trying.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, we can't do it by
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_17]: And opioids are, number one, effective for
pain.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, number two, people are dependent on
them.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think we're, you know,
for the most part, physicians are doing
[SPEAKER_17]: the best they can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question, please.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for a great panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for the work that you're all
doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ziva, my question is for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You mentioned that your research subjects
were able to use a lower dose of their
[SPEAKER_08]: opioid when they were smoking,
I'm assuming, THC dominant cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Julia, you started to talk a little
bit about maybe some signaling between the
[SPEAKER_08]: endocannabinoid system and opioid
receptors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ziva, could you maybe speculate a little
bit on what might be going on in terms of
[SPEAKER_08]: a mechanism there?
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's interesting, because it's not
that, so this was cannabis with THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no cannabidiol in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's clear, I followed up looking at
the ability of naltrexone to be able to
[SPEAKER_11]: antagonize cannabinoids, analgesic
effects.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's clear that it's not necessarily,
it's not directly mu-mediated,
[SPEAKER_11]: mu-opioid receptor-mediated, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So there does seem to be some synergy with
regards to the signaling cascade
[SPEAKER_11]: downstream of the immediate activation at
the mu-opioid receptor when you combine
[SPEAKER_11]: the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_11]: But to be honest, the mechanism,
as far as I know, hasn't been worked out
[SPEAKER_11]: yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's important to understand that
mechanism if we're going to look at other
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoids or other terpenes that might
help to amplify the opioid-sparing effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, have you found in your practice
there's a certain CBD to THC ratio that's
[SPEAKER_01]: best to start patients on for pain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Caroline.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: So for pain, somebody on opiates or just
pain in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it depends on the type of pain.
[SPEAKER_13]: So certainly those with inflammatory
processes, CBD is a really good starting
[SPEAKER_13]: point.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do try to use the smallest amount of
THC to get the best response.
[SPEAKER_13]: So frequently I do use a lot of oils,
and I'll use CBD oil in the daytime and
[SPEAKER_13]: THC oil at night.
[SPEAKER_13]: If someone's not sleeping, sleep is a
great opportunity to take advantage of
[SPEAKER_13]: THC, get some really good sleep.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've actually found that many patients
don't even need something during the
[SPEAKER_13]: daytime once their sleep has been
restored.
[SPEAKER_13]: They feel they can cope better with their
day-to-day pain.
[SPEAKER_13]: So CBD day, THC night.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, someone who has a lot more
neurological type of pain, I do find that
[SPEAKER_13]: THC can be more helpful.
[SPEAKER_13]: So frequently I'll use a one-to-one ratio,
CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: CBD is nice to counteract some of the side
effects we can see with THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do still use THC on its own without
CBD, but a lot of the times I'll use a
[SPEAKER_13]: one-to-one during the daytime.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, of course, oils are great for
long-acting coverage, so using them three
[SPEAKER_13]: times a day.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then think about vaporization as a
breakthrough option.
[SPEAKER_13]: So for acute pain or flare-ups,
it's another good tool, no different than
[SPEAKER_13]: long-acting insulin and short-acting
insulin or long-acting opioids,
[SPEAKER_13]: a similar structure like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, we do sometimes see trends such
as migraines may need a bit more THC and
[SPEAKER_13]: different types of pain conditions.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, there's so many different
other treatment plans, but that's kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: an overview.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dustin, I don't know if you... Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, all I wanted to add is that on my
free patient education website,
[SPEAKER_03]: healer.com, I have a guide on how to use
cannabis to reduce opioids and to replace
[SPEAKER_03]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's directed as patient education,
and so that's something that people can
[SPEAKER_03]: access, and I'd love to hear your feedback
and your feedback on that document.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the last question that we are
allotted time for.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for addressing the policy issue,
because here in California, we're 10
[SPEAKER_10]: months into adult use, and it's harder
than ever for people to access cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: products that are state-legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: But my real question is addressing the
ethical question of pain management
[SPEAKER_10]: clinics here in California, telling
people, if you test positive for THC,
[SPEAKER_10]: we're going to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think to begin with, the 2016 CDC
guidelines on opioid prescribing for
[SPEAKER_03]: chronic pain stated very clearly that
clinicians do not need to be testing the
[SPEAKER_03]: urine of their opioid-using patients for
THC, because the results of that test
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't clearly direct clinical action.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have the federal government
saying we don't need to test the urine for
[SPEAKER_03]: THC, and I think just bringing that
information to the pain doctors is a great
[SPEAKER_03]: place to start, since it's in a federal
document.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other comments?
[SPEAKER_17]: There's just a lot of misunderstanding in
general about use disorders.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not dissimilar from people who are
in medication-assisted treatment for
[SPEAKER_17]: opioid use disorder, with methadone or
buprenorphine being penalized for having
[SPEAKER_17]: urine that tests positive for cocaine or
THC or benzodiazepines or anything like
[SPEAKER_17]: that, when they're not being treated for
those conditions.
[SPEAKER_17]: And to me, it gets back to an unmoralistic
attitude, which really doesn't admit that
[SPEAKER_17]: we're treating diseases.
[SPEAKER_17]: Opioid use disorder is a disease.
[SPEAKER_17]: Chronic pain is another kind of disease.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that instead, we're thinking that
we're going to influence people's behavior
[SPEAKER_17]: and somehow make them different people.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think it requires advocacy on the
part of all of us to the people who are
[SPEAKER_17]: making those kinds of rules and saying
that they don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like they may keep adding time to
our clock here, so let's take another
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen any of the research looking
at how the opioid receptors are negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: allosterically modulated by CBD and THC?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not aware of any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it on Prof. Pot and looked it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, please let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_12]: My question is for Max.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it seems that everybody talks about
the subject of not having enough
[SPEAKER_12]: resources, meaning economic resources,
to do trials and studies and everything
[SPEAKER_12]: that everybody wants to have done.
[SPEAKER_12]: So from a philanthropy side, do you see
there to be any movement to have
[SPEAKER_12]: philanthropists help out in funding these
types of clinical trials?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Thomas Jefferson University in
Philadelphia recently created a giant
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis research institute and I think
received a $10 million gift from an
[SPEAKER_07]: Australian individual, the Lambert family.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's a worldwide effort really
going into funding a lot of this research,
[SPEAKER_07]: but a lot more of it is needed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clinical research is a very, very
expensive game, and it constantly needs
[SPEAKER_07]: more and more funding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one question.
[SPEAKER_15]: Please.
[SPEAKER_15]: Has everyone sent in their comments to the
FDA about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's due by October 31st.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can do it electronically or by snail
mail.
[SPEAKER_15]: I still have a few postcards that are
already addressed.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's the question.
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you sent in your comments?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the announcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, I hope everyone remembers to do so
and feel free to pick up a postcard if you
[SPEAKER_03]: need one.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's head over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to know if any of you
wonderful people have heard of and or
[SPEAKER_02]: worked with the Indonesian herb kratom in
treatment of opioid addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not in treatment of opioid
addiction, but I've used, I believe they
[SPEAKER_03]: call it kratom over there, which is a leaf
of a tropical tree that has partial
[SPEAKER_03]: agonist activity at the opioid receptors,
at least at the mu opioid based on two
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds, one that's a little bit
stronger than the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's traditionally used by people to
promote endurance and to help them work
[SPEAKER_03]: and to relieve pain and as kind of a
social thing to use with very,
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as I understand, very low incidence
of abuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've used it in my patient
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned about it from my patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had several patients that are off
opioid pharmaceuticals that are using a
[SPEAKER_03]: combination of cannabis and kratom very
successfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also seems to have this bidirectional
effect where low doses are stimulating and
[SPEAKER_03]: higher doses are sedating, which is quite
helpful for daytime use versus sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's incredible therapeutic
potential for combining these two herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also the varietals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many varietals and lots of quality
assurance issues in the kratom industry
[SPEAKER_03]: that we also deal with in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're probably a long ways from
widespread clinical adaptation,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think there's a lot of promise
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kratom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if we're not getting cut off,
then let's do one more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that you, Matt?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or David?
[SPEAKER_03]: David, go for it, David.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_16]: You had mentioned the cost to patients as
being a barrier to treatment.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm wondering, Max, why, if you could
put up the word that if one makes oils
[SPEAKER_16]: from buds, which are really made for
smoking or vaporizing, why not make plants
[SPEAKER_16]: for oils like we grow lettuce without
having to worry about insects and the
[SPEAKER_16]: curing process?
[SPEAKER_16]: And the other question is the idea of
leveling out patients by giving them a
[SPEAKER_16]: broad spectrum oil to get them on a level
playing field.
[SPEAKER_16]: So different people now will maybe not
have different effects from specific
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabinoids being added to their
condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some farmers that are growing
specific strains of cannabis or varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they cut off the mic?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they could.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the restlessness purposes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's people out there that are
doing that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are certain varieties that are
better than others.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also very dependent on where it's
grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you don't want to grow a super
resinous variety in a dusty, arid
[SPEAKER_07]: environment because the plant matters.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be filthy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have to wash it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to lose a lot of those
beneficial photocannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_07]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So really trying to find the best variety
to grow in these climates, in certain
[SPEAKER_07]: particular climates is what's crucial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll just tie your question back into
the conversation here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the absence of really
understanding the different chemo
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties of cannabis and what might be
appropriate, one thing is that combining a
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity of chemo bars may have good
impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I agree with you, growing and
extracting with an intention to deliver
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabinoids oral mucosally instead of
via inhalation might be an appropriate
[SPEAKER_03]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I was going to talk about that
too, the difference between sativa
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties and extracts of THC from certain
sativa varieties grown certain ways
[SPEAKER_05]: causing insomnia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not having a synergetic effect at all
with opiates specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that certain strains of indica that
work very well, and even the THC that's
[SPEAKER_05]: not pure THC, there's other compounds in
there that'd be more of a whole plant THC
[SPEAKER_05]: predominant from an indica variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think when those fine details get
overlooked, either because they're just
[SPEAKER_03]: simply overlooked or because all you have
to deal with is NIDA 5.7.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the research doesn't necessarily
reflect what's happening in the clinic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're doing our best to bring that
close together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, just my comment had to do
with that was a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you guys noticed the difference in
different material that you're available
[SPEAKER_05]: to get to give patients?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to, the comment was made
about high CBD and its effects and THC and
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD together and THC by itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if sometimes THC combines with opiates
and the other strains don't, I've
[SPEAKER_05]: developed a strain called Old Toby that
could be the last strain you'd want to
[SPEAKER_05]: take if you were trying to get off
opiates.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd probably do more opiates on that
particular variety of hyper sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many unknowns and nuances.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all for your time and
attention and participation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially thank you all for making
this a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you to Dustin for putting this
together.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
