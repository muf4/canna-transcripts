[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my pleasure to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about recent advances in
cannabinoid, in phytocannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and endocannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with Professor Rafi Mashulam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this work, this is the recent work that
has been done in our lab in collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: with other labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last few decades, research on
cannabinoid has gone through several
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytocannabinoids, endocannabinoids,
and endocannabinoid-like research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thousands of publications have been
published on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are already in use as
therapeutic agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytocannabinoid research, I'm going to
cover nausea, anxiety, and depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis sativa, it contains many
bioactive compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most representatives are
cannabinoids, flavonoids, and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And among the cannabinoids, we have the
tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the cannabis psychoactive
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other main cannabinoids include the
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, cannabinol,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol, and cannabidiolic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cannabinoids, they are biosynthesized
in their acid form in the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabidiolic acid is the main
biosynthetic precursor of the acids of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, THC, and cannabichromine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these can generate their
decarboxylated counterparts under the
[SPEAKER_00]: action of heat or light.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD will give CBD, THC will give THC,
cannabichrominic acid will give
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabichromine, and cannabicarolic acid
will give cannabicarol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cannabidiolic acid, which is the
major constituent of cannabis sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: was first isolated in 1955.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its structure was elucidated in 1965.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been shown to inhibit breast cancer
cell migration and to have anti-nosia and
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-anxiety effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the instability of this compound
weakens the case of developing it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, we decided to compare it
with its methyl ester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the decarboxylation of the acids,
it proceeds through the formation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: carboxyl anion, and this is not readily
formed in the methyl ester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we found that the CBD methyl
ester is stable under different conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: up to six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in collaboration with Professor Roger
Partway and Linda Parker, and knowing that
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system plays a major
role in the regulation of nausea and
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety, we were able to see that the CBD
methyl ester was much more potent than the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA in enhancing the serotonin 1A
receptor activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, it was much more effective
in reducing the acute nausea and
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-sipatory nausea-induced behavior in
the rat-gapping model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, CBDA methyl ester proved to be an
anti-anxiety compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a model of stress-induced angiogenic
responding, we were able to see that when
[SPEAKER_00]: the rats, they received a kind of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the food shock stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 24 hours later, they were given
vehicle or CBDA or CBDA methyl ester,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they were placed in the dark
compartment of the light dark box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the time that is spent in the light
box, it was tracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if the mice spend time in the light
box, then they are not anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they spend time in the dark box,
then they are anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we found that the food shock
greatly enhanced the stress-induced
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior responding in the food shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to expand the results that we got
with the CBDA methyl ester that it has
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-anxiety effect, and knowing that the
serotonin 1A receptor is important for the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment of human depression,
we were able, together with Professor
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron Veller, to see that CBDA methyl
ester, it reduces the anti-depression
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior in rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually, the antidepressive-like
behavior, the depressive-like behavior in
[SPEAKER_00]: mice are seen as increased immobility and
decreased swimming in the forced swim
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBDA methyl ester decreased the
immobility and increased the swimming in
[SPEAKER_00]: these rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the endocannabinoids and
endocannabinoid-like compounds research,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cover here two types of
topics, which are antimicrobial potential
[SPEAKER_00]: and addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, after the discovery of THC in 1964,
the first endogenous lipophilic molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: that was able to activate the CB1 and the
CB2 that are activated by THC was
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this compound was identified in 1992
to be anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shortly after, another compound,
which is important endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: compound, was discovered, which is
2-archidonylglycerol-2AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following that, omega-6, other omega-6
fatty acid compounds that have kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mimetic properties as well, such as
Noladine-E, ether, viridamide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 2-archidonyl dopamine, NADA,
they were listed among the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last 25 years, anandamide and
all of these compounds, they had key
[SPEAKER_00]: biological activities in the central
nervous system and in the periphery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, compounds that are considered amides
of lead, long-chain fatty acids with amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acids, or with ethanol amines,
they represent a major group of endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these compounds, they are found in the
brain and part of them in the periphery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not bind to the cannabinoid
receptors CB1 or CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they have a cannabinoid-dependent
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, they are considered as
parts of the endocannabinoid family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these compounds, they have numerous
physiological functions in the mammalian
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, palmitoyl-ethanolamide,
PA, it is anti-inflammatory,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-neoceptive, neuroprotective,
anti-convulsant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Olyol-ethanolamide, it regulates food
intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Archidonyl-serine, it's vasoactive,
acts in neuroprotective as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And olyl-serine was shown to have
anti-osseoporotic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is limited information for the
role of the endocannabinoid system during
[SPEAKER_00]: infection, especially against invading
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to see the role of the
endocannabinoid system against microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So together with Professor Dorensteinberg,
we studied the antimicrobial potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids and endocannabinoids-like
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, chorum sensing is a bacterial
communication process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bacteria, they use chorum sensing in
order to attach themselves to surfaces and
[SPEAKER_00]: form bacterial biofilms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bacteria inside the bacterial
biofilms, they are 10 to 1,000 times more
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to antibiotics than the
free-plant tonic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use here the Vibrio Harvey bacteria
in order to study the chorum sensing
[SPEAKER_00]: because it emits bioluminescence as a
response to chorum sensing stimulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw then, the endocannabinoid
anandamide, among other endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and endocannabinoids-like compounds,
it inhibited the chorum sensing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Vibrio Harvey strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduced the gene expression of the
chorum sensing pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it inhibited the mortality of the
Vibrio Harvey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moreover, another kind of bacteria,
which is the methicillin-resistant S.
[SPEAKER_00]: auris, it is a kind of bacteria that is
responsible for many difficult-to-treat
[SPEAKER_00]: infections in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of bacteria is a
biofilm-forming microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biofilms, they are formed on the
implanted medical devices, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: catheters, and on the necrotic tissues in
wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to see as well that
anandamide and the endocannabinoid-like
[SPEAKER_00]: compound, arachidonyl serine, they were
those dependently inhibited, showed
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibition for the biofilm formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They inhibited the colony spread,
and they reduced the bacterial aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a publication in 2007 in Science
stated that cigarette smokers with brain
[SPEAKER_00]: damage involving the insular cortex,
they displaced cessation of tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking, which implicates that the insula
is a region in the brain that may
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to nicotine addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, together with another three
groups in Canada, Richmond, Virginia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Italy, we wanted to find molecules
that were able to treat nicotine
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do this by searching for
neurochemicals in the insular cortex of
[SPEAKER_00]: the brain that can be altered by traumatic
brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by using lipidomic analysis,
we were able to see that by comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: traumatic brain injury and normal brain
areas, that the traumatic brain injury
[SPEAKER_00]: elicited substantial increases in the
endocannabinoid-like compound
[SPEAKER_00]: oleilglycine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we wanted to see if the exogenous
oleilglycine will alter the withdrawal
[SPEAKER_00]: responses in the nicotine-dependent mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mice were given nicotine or saline for
14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the nicotinic group, they were given
oleilglycine or vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 minutes later, they were given the
nicotine acetylcholine antagonist
[SPEAKER_00]: micamylamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 25 minutes later, they were evaluated
by the elevated plus maze and physical
[SPEAKER_00]: somatic withdrawal signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the elevated plus maze, this is a
test in order to assess the anxiety-like
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the mice, they are anxious as a result
of withdrawal, then they will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: exploring the open arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are not anxious, then they will be
exploring the open arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw is that the mice,
the nicotine-dependent mice, undergoing
[SPEAKER_00]: micamylamine precipitated withdrawal
signs, they had reduced time exploring the
[SPEAKER_00]: open arm, and oleilglycine actually
increased the open arm time, indicating
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is attenuating the withdrawal
symptoms in these dependent mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, this compound was able to
attenuate or interfere with the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: somatic withdrawal signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these usually, they are seen as body
tumors, head shakes, backings,
[SPEAKER_00]: curlings, and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we saw that oleilglycine,
it reduced the reward effect of nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was seen by a conditioned place
preference test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mice exhibited two neutral
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two environments, distinct
environments, they are paired spatially
[SPEAKER_00]: and temporarily with unconditioned
stimuli.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, on days two, four,
and six, they were given, the mice were
[SPEAKER_00]: given drug in the dark compartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on days three, six, and seven,
they were given saline in the white
[SPEAKER_00]: compartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on day eight, they are given the
freedom to explore both compartments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the time spent in any of these
compartments is an indication of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reinforcing effect of the unconditioned
stimuli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw is that oleilglycine,
those dependently inhibited the reward
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It inhibited the development of the
nicotine conditioned place preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oleilglycine didn't interact with CB1 or
CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it inhibited FA, which is the
enzyme responsible for the degradation of
[SPEAKER_00]: anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it behaved as a PPAR alpha receptor
agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to see if we can do as well the
same with morphine, we could find that
[SPEAKER_00]: oleilglycine, it blocked the aversive
effect of the morphine withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this indicated that oleilglycine might
affect or decrease the impact of the
[SPEAKER_00]: morphine withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this effect was reversed by a CB1
antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there are somatic withdrawals
signs for the morphine addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were seen as mouthing movement,
abdominal contractions, diarrhea,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lying on belly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw is that oleilglycine as
well attenuated these morphine withdrawal
[SPEAKER_00]: nausea somatic behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this effect, it was prevented by the
PPAR alpha and CB1 antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, oleilglycine, it has an amide bond,
which means that it can be hydrolyzed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the body by amideses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought of, is there any way of
stabilizing this compound metabolically by
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing something to stabilize the
compound?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a similar molecule, which is
anandamide, the introduction of a methyl
[SPEAKER_00]: group adjacent to the amide bond was able
to potentiate its activity and stability
[SPEAKER_00]: of the anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, we prepared in the lab
methylated oleilglycine and demethylated
[SPEAKER_00]: oleilglycine with the hope that
methylation will do the same in
[SPEAKER_00]: oleilglycine as it did in anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we found that only the
monomethyl oleilglycine, it produced a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger or longer lasting interference with
the oleilglycine precipitated morphine
[SPEAKER_00]: withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to explain this, if oleilglycine was
given 10 minutes before the naloxone,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it had its effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: While if it was given 60 minutes before
the naloxone, it didn't give any effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the monomethyl oleilglycine,
10 minutes or 60 minutes, if it was given
[SPEAKER_00]: before naloxone, then it gave its effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this effect was as well prevented by
CB1 antagonists and PPAR alpha
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to summarize, we can say that the CBDA
methyl ester is a potential medicine for
[SPEAKER_00]: treating nausea, anxiety, depression,
and other disorders that are mediated by
[SPEAKER_00]: the 5 serotonin 1A receptor activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, still, we need more research to
be done, more models, animal models,
[SPEAKER_00]: and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid and
endocannabinoid-like compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may act as a natural line of defense
against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid compound-like compound
oleilglycine, it interferes with the
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine withdrawal and with the
naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a more stable compound, which is
monomethyl oleilglycine, it may be a more
[SPEAKER_00]: stable agent to combat the aversive effect
of acute naloxone-precipitated morphine
[SPEAKER_00]: withdrawal than oleilglycine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I would like to thank all of
our collaborators, Roger Pertwee in
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotland, Linda Parker in Canada,
Aaron Veller and Ron Steinberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: in Israel, in USA, Aaron Lichtman in
Italy, DiMarzo, and thank you for your
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, thank you for the great
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: A question about these compounds getting
into the brain if they're administered
[SPEAKER_02]: systemically in the periphery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what sort of evidence is there that
endocannabinoid or endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds administered in the periphery or
systemically cross the blood-brain barrier
[SPEAKER_02]: and can affect the brain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did some tests and we have showed
that, for example, when oleilglycine is
[SPEAKER_00]: given and then it penetrates the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is evidence and there are studies,
but I didn't show this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it also work for anandamide or 2AG
administered in the periphery to cross the
[SPEAKER_02]: blood-brain barrier?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you compared,
when you were looking at the binding of
[SPEAKER_01]: the methyl ester CBDA to 5-HT1A,
if you did compare it to the neutral form
[SPEAKER_01]: of CBD as well as CBDA or just to CBDA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it is not binding to the
serotonin 1A receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is activating it and it was,
yes, we compared it with the CBD and CBDA
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was more effective than both of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your overview.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any evidence for phytocannabinoid
inhibition of your quorum-sensing
[SPEAKER_03]: bacterial biology the same way you were
talking about for the endogenous
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, in a previous paper,
we did the same studies, quorum-sensing
[SPEAKER_00]: and bacterial biofilm with the HU210,
which is a synthetic compound that binds
[SPEAKER_00]: to both cannabinoid receptors,
CB1 and CB2, and it did the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the literature, there is limited
information regarding this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only certain cannabinoids that
are antibacterial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids antibacterial, HU210,
which binds to CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts actually as anti-biofilm formation
and anti-quorum-sensing and our studies on
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the only data we have.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
