[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Senior Marketing Manager at
Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud member of the team that puts on
the CanMed Innovation and Investment
[SPEAKER_00]: Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you check out canmedevents.com,
you may notice that things look a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have updated the site to include the
dates and location for CanMed 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will take place June 17th through
the 20th at the Wyndham Resort in Rio
[SPEAKER_00]: Grande, Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are really excited about next year's
event, which will include all the great
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, and innovation
content you've come to expect from CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: with ample opportunities for collaboration
and networking as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be adding more details to the site
in the coming weeks and months,
[SPEAKER_00]: so be sure to sign up for email alerts and
receive all of those announcements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also added the CanMed 24
presentation videos to the CanMed archive
[SPEAKER_00]: at canmedevents.com, so be sure to check
those out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Dr. Deborah Kimlis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deb has been in the medical cannabis field
since 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where her diverse involvement spans many
areas, including cannabis cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: processing, formulation, testing,
patient care, and conducting research.
[SPEAKER_00]: She consults within the industry as an
advisor for companies who are interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in novel formulations specific to medical
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: She develops protocols, obtains IRB
approval, conducts clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: and helps publish the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 24, Deb presented a poster that
shared data from an open-label clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trial investigating the use of a
cannabinoid-enhanced topical cream to
[SPEAKER_00]: alleviate symptoms of restless leg
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: RLS is a condition that affects up to 10%
of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: population, including Deb herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: She found relief using a CBDA-based
topical cream and is working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: product manufacturer to conduct clinical
trials that demonstrate its effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss the
symptoms of RLS and possible causes,
[SPEAKER_00]: Deb's own struggles with the condition,
why many conventional and pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments for RLS fall short,
why CBDA appears to be an effective
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, why a transdermal approach is
better than ingesting or inhaling
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, and Deb shares results from
that open-label clinical trial,
[SPEAKER_00]: including some pretty remarkable success
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with Deb,
I'd like to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Trusted Cannon Nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trusted Cannon Nurse was founded by Megan
Bang and Ariane Williams, two nurses who
[SPEAKER_00]: are dedicated to bridging the gap between
traditional medicine and the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They specialize in creating evidence-based
treatment plans for all ages that address
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic illnesses, treatment-resistant
conditions, mental health, autism,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at TrustedCannonNurse.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Deb
[SPEAKER_00]: Kimless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Deb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast yet again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'm excited to talk with you
today about Restless Leg Syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a poster at CanMed24 that
presented data from an open-label clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trial that looked at using a
cannabinoid-enhanced topical cream for
[SPEAKER_00]: alleviating Restless Leg Syndrome,
which I know we're gonna dive into,
[SPEAKER_00]: but before we do that, I was hoping,
could you tell us a bit about your
[SPEAKER_00]: background and how you became interested
in investigating using cannabis to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: Restless Leg Syndrome?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it's a long story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in 2013, I'd entered into the
cannabis space by just being really
[SPEAKER_01]: inquisitive, learning about medical
cannabis as a method of treating a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: host of diseases and medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through this process, I had myself in many
different touch points, including an
[SPEAKER_01]: owner-operator of a company that
cultivated and processed cannabis products
[SPEAKER_01]: for patients in the medical market,
as well as guiding patients in the
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment and use of cannabis for whatever
conditions they're struggling with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I've sort of evolved into
conducting research for companies whose
[SPEAKER_01]: passion is to rise above the fray and
distinguish themselves by actually looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at a particular method of administration
or form factor and applying it to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how I got into the cannabis
space, and that's sort of my 11-year
[SPEAKER_01]: journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason why I chose Restless Leg is
because I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've had it now since 2006,
and it's a weird, strange condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've subsequently learned that
actually it's a pretty common neurologic
[SPEAKER_01]: condition, affecting upwards of 15% of the
general population, which is a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: large number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the issue is with it, like many
disease processes, there's not one
[SPEAKER_01]: causative factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine came on after my breast cancer
surgery, and they actually treated me with
[SPEAKER_01]: post-op pain meds for a prolonged period
of time because I developed a neuropathic
[SPEAKER_01]: pain syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got off this med, and then I
ended up with Restless Leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been trialed on a whole host of
different pharmacologic therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a bunch of different ones
that are either off-label utilized or
[SPEAKER_01]: on-label utilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the different categories are anywhere
from GABA analogs, like Gabapentin,
[SPEAKER_01]: to dopaminergic-type drugs, to adenosine,
to even iron supplementation, because iron
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency can also cause this.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of those improved my symptoms,
and it was and has been incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing about Restless Leg
that's almost ubiquitous when you talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: people is that the treatment that is most
efficacious is getting up and stretching
[SPEAKER_01]: your legs and walking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, unfortunately, that disturbs your
sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the culprit issue here because
now, yes, you're treating your Restless
[SPEAKER_01]: Leg, but you're sleep deprived.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your whole day is shot the next
day because you're roaming around the
[SPEAKER_01]: house or stretching your leg or moving
around so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your partner, if you have one in the bed
with you, is also sleep deprived.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the whole household is disrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many times would you be getting up
throughout the night?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like many times, like many, many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because when you first go
to sleep, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then an hour, you'll wake up,
you'll stretch, you'll walk around,
[SPEAKER_01]: you go to the bathroom, you get a drink of
water, you go back to bed, and you hope
[SPEAKER_01]: that this will go away and then it
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even interestingly, when you utilize
an oral, ingestible form of cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've tried many, sadly, it didn't work
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just like all of the other traditional
pharmacotherapeutics, it didn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: reliably.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it would work and maybe it
was just out of sheer exhaustion that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would stay asleep or maybe it did work,
but I couldn't say, well, this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: capsule or gummy or this or that,
okay, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it became a thought experiment for me
because I'm like, well, what's interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: is even though it's a neurologic issue and
there's been studies looking at central
[SPEAKER_01]: neurologic issues, so in the cerebrum,
spinal cord issues, peripheral nerve,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's ubiquitous and consistent is that
people get up and stretch and move around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a peripheral mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a mechanoreceptor and we've got
a whole bunch of different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanoreceptors in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanoreceptors are these little
receptors in our body that allows us to
[SPEAKER_01]: feel temperature changes, proprioception.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you close your eyes and you're
standing, you don't fall on your nose,
[SPEAKER_01]: your body's able to adjust to where it is
without having you fall and vibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the special types of
receptors that do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here, if I stretch, it kind of feels
good slash hurts, and then I'm able to go
[SPEAKER_01]: back to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, what if we block the
mechanoreceptors peripherally,
[SPEAKER_01]: not centrally?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if that would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how would we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried lots of different topical
over-the-counter stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got over-the-counter NSAIDs,
they've got over-the-counter magnesiums,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got over-the-counter menthols,
camphor, castor oil, none of that seemed
[SPEAKER_01]: to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started thinking about CBDA
because CBDA is a very potent
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it works on a whole host of
different types of receptors, not CB1 or
[SPEAKER_01]: CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabinoid one or two receptors that
are either central peripheral,
[SPEAKER_01]: but other kinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started researching that it actually
works on a trip A1 receptors and these
[SPEAKER_01]: piezo receptors and may seem to be
intimately involved in stretch receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm like, hmm, I wonder if that
would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I applied a special formula of CBDA,
and I'll get into that in a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: onto my legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the first time in almost 20 years,
I was able to sleep through the night and
[SPEAKER_01]: I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I called the owner of the company,
the PhD scientist that formulated this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular iteration and said,
let's run this clinical trial because this
[SPEAKER_01]: is my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now can you describe what the symptoms
feel like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it just like you have an urge to
move your legs?
[SPEAKER_01]: This unbelievable, intense urge,
annoying pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to say cramp because some
people do get cramps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not experience that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just this intense, squeezy pressure
that you just have to get up and do toe
[SPEAKER_01]: lifts and just stretch out for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people have other manifestations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have it in their entire leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have restless leg,
even though it's a misnomer for them in
[SPEAKER_01]: their arms, where they just have to get up
and just stretch their arms all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met up with one patient who wore out the
sheets on the bottom of her bed from
[SPEAKER_01]: continually stretching like literal holes
in her sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and and you mentioned that the relief
is in a lot of cases, getting up,
[SPEAKER_00]: moving, stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to imagine that for older people or
maybe people who aren't as mobile,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not really an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that must be difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then what happens like sometimes I'm
super exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just flex and extend my my feet to
stretch my calves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you aptly put, I mean, one,
that's not 100% efficacious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, as an older person, if they're on
any other medications or they have
[SPEAKER_01]: mobility issues or stability issues or
just waking up from a sound sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get disoriented, you know,
could lead to falls or other injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and you're exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're you're literally,
you know, super sleep deprived.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did I understand correctly when you
were kind of investigating different
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't so much like stimulating that
stretch or mimicking sort of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulation of the stretch receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually blocking those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the goal of the traditional
therapeutic is to try to block from either
[SPEAKER_01]: central spinal cord conduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so they're looking at working on
GABA and dopamine and and those types of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, you know, you see a lot
of pregnant women who complain of restless
[SPEAKER_01]: leg during pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But interestingly, even after you correct
for their iron deficiency, oftentimes a
[SPEAKER_01]: restless leg still remains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if it's true, true and
unrelated or truly positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really has to find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not a lot of research out
there on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But any time you take a centrally acting
pharmaceutical, there are centrally acting
[SPEAKER_01]: adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including, you know, somnolence,
balance issues, you know, a whole host of
[SPEAKER_01]: other side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I prefer and I'm very sensitive to
all kinds of pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea of a topically applied therapy
to me made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is so is the idea with those other
therapeutics, you're sort of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: block that signal from the legs to the
brain saying, like, we need to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to cut that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was it's blocking blocking some
kind of aberrant signal from the brain
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted peripheral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so it's the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's top down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start stopping that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just trying to block whatever is
being aberrantly transmitted, because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's weird wrong signals,
not unlike neuropathic pain, which is you
[SPEAKER_01]: no longer have a pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing causing your pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is it about cannabis or,
you know, CBD that kind of makes it an
[SPEAKER_00]: effective treatment here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC, THC, CBD, CBD, all of the
cannabinoids work on many different types
[SPEAKER_01]: of receptors, including the trip a ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nice thing about CBD and CBD is that,
at least for now, in the current legal
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape, you don't have to jump through
as many hoops as you would if you were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to experiment or use THC or even THC
at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're walking a fine line.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing about this particular
formulation of CBD is that it's about 75
[SPEAKER_01]: percent CBD, about five percent CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working with both both of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's formulated in a way that is very
special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's complexed with a metal called
magnesium, and it is formulated so that it
[SPEAKER_01]: has both hydrophilicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It likes water and lipophilicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It likes fat and allows for penetration
through our skin, which makes it available
[SPEAKER_01]: to the deeper tissue, the deeper receptors
within the dermis, which is where these
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanoreceptors reside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did an experiment with just CBD-A or
just CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, regular CBD I've tried and
didn't work, but just CBD-A without this
[SPEAKER_01]: special formulation to see if it would
work or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably venture to say probably
not as well because this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation from this company,
that's their secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows for this dermal penetration of
these cannabinoids to allow it to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the topical application, like you said
before, better than oral because it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: localized or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when it's more localized,
it's more bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any time you ingest anything,
it goes through the metabolic process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even if you have X amount of
milligrams of whatever cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_01]: once it goes through that digestive
process and gets metabolized, you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: lesser amount available, plus it's
distributed throughout your entire body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here it's local to the area where your
mechanoreceptors are peripherally that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to block.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same then with inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be bypassing the digestive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, like you said, it'd be
distributed throughout the whole body and
[SPEAKER_00]: not be as effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with CBD-A, because I believe
that that is way more efficacious than
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD-A, if you're heating it as an
inhalation, either through smoking or
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizing, you're converting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount of CBD-A you're getting is
much, much less than what is being applied
[SPEAKER_01]: and available topically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless they create a vaporizer of CBD-A
that maintains that, so it was a cold
[SPEAKER_01]: vapor or a method of inhaling,
but again, you'd have to worry about that
[SPEAKER_01]: volume of distribution within our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, how wonderful and accessible is
it that you are applying it locally?
[SPEAKER_01]: The adverse effects are de minimis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing, and I'll discuss the small
trial that we conducted, but nobody had
[SPEAKER_01]: any issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the only thing that I could think
of would be a skin irritation from any of
[SPEAKER_01]: the excipients from the shea butter that
is the base, which is pretty neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, let's get into sort of the
results from the trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing what I just said, the
bioavailability, the topical application,
[SPEAKER_01]: the penetration of this, I'm like,
well, I can't be the only one that is
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one other thing, remember,
we're not unfortunately not curing
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, because those aberrant signals
continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sort of hopeful that maybe if I
continue to block them peripherally,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe that signal, that circus signaling
will go away, but thus far it hasn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: for me at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the 10 people I've trialed it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put out actually on social media,
hey, anybody with restless leg,
[SPEAKER_01]: give me a buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got this topical application.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I received a bunch of different
people who contacted me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the premise was, is that there is a
international restless leg syndrome
[SPEAKER_01]: validated questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 11 questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I did a patient's global impression
of change, which looks at quality of life
[SPEAKER_01]: pre and post-treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used those two measurements real
quick just to see how people responded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you either know it or you don't
know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you have to build this up to
see if it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I did run the trial for two weeks
just to see what other people's
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had on the IRLS validated
questionnaire, you had to have a restless
[SPEAKER_01]: leg score of a seven or greater.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of a scale of zero to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the minimum inclusion
criteria for you to have that to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could actually still be on a
pharmacologic therapeutic because if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're seven or greater, clearly it's not
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, what were you gonna say?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of those questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how often do you get up?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long have you had this for?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does it disrupt your evening?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does it disrupt your day the
following day?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does it disrupt your ability to
live your life?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's pretty significant stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: How often do you get up?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do these sessions last?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a 24 hour period, are you up and
running around at night for three hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: four hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those people are really struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounds like, oh, restless leg,
no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually very disruptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can remember the first time I
heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have been like a late night
infomercial type of therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, restless leg?
[SPEAKER_00]: What even is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I've heard others struggling
with it, my grandmother towards the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: her life was starting to struggle with
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what made me think of I mean,
she wasn't the most mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that must have been really difficult
for her if the urge is to get up and start
[SPEAKER_00]: moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like having an itch you can't
scratch how crazy that must be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm lucky I can get up and move
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't even imagine somebody who is
bedridden and, you know, or reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: mobility and doesn't have the ability to
at least try to solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be insanely frustrating and
disruptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 10 people, the average the average,
you know, struggle for restless leg was
[SPEAKER_01]: like eight plus on these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they they met and exceeded that that
issue, the seven or greater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we trialed them for for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I gave the questionnaires again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the PGIC, which is at the
end, comparing how you feel today versus
[SPEAKER_01]: how you felt before the before the
clinical trial began.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not I mean, the statistical
significance was insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, our end was small.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of people I recruited were only
10.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason was it costs money to run
clinical trials and to give out free
[SPEAKER_01]: medication and to, you know, make these
things and get a statistician to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and this is a, you know,
a small company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funding this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was everybody responded.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were two people that didn't have
statistical significance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a reduction, but not statistical
significance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody else had an insane reduction in
their restless leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there is a woman who is a
musician and she could never perform
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her restless leg occurred 24 seven alone,
not just at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: She could never sit and watch television.
[SPEAKER_01]: She could never sit and go to a movie or a
play or a concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you saw her perform and I've seen
her perform, she would roam the stage
[SPEAKER_01]: while singing and perform and playing
guitar or ukulele or banjo or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: else she was playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular topical has been
transformative for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has taken her from a scale of zero to
10, 10 being the worst you can ever be to
[SPEAKER_01]: a zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's not the only one, but she is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the most vociferous about
screaming from the rooftops, how
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: This treatment has been for her,
how life affirming and life changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she was getting depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was going to neurologist after
neurologist after neurologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying a whole host of medicines that just
either knocked her out or made her feel
[SPEAKER_01]: even more depressed or suicidal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had to get off all of these other
crazy medicines, which by the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: made her depressed or somnolent,
but didn't take, didn't take care of the
[SPEAKER_01]: restless leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just made her even more sleepy than she
was before.
[SPEAKER_01]: From being sleep deprived.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all the, all the drawbacks of the
side effects and not the benefits of the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a story that I heard from the
other nine patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, every single person that was on a
medicine got off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they started, once the, after the two
week trial, when they were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, this cream really works.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've all weaned themselves off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how is it, just one application
before bed and you're, and you're good or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's different and everybody's
symptoms are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beauty of this is that the systemic
uptake of this, even though it does
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dermally, the systemic uptake is a de
minimis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to worry about,
you know, cytochrome P450 issues or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, worrying about other medications
that you're taking and, and the metabolism
[SPEAKER_01]: thereof.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I recommend to people is apply 30
to 45 minutes before bed, rub it in really
[SPEAKER_01]: well to the affected areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, some people had restless leg,
but it was just their knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people had restless feet syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just their feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine is just the back of my, it's just my
calves and no other part of my leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rub that area, the affected area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always tell them less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, because it's, if you're layering it on
thick, you're just wasting, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the med, you know, the, the, the topical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you put on until you rub it in really
well and go to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in case of this woman that I spoke
about, like whenever she wanted to watch a
[SPEAKER_01]: TV show or a movie or a concert,
put it on right before you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was able to watch television.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was able to like binge watch Netflix,
which she has never seated, which she's
[SPEAKER_01]: never been able to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause before she would be just pacing the
living room, pacing, getting up,
[SPEAKER_01]: moving around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exhausting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this poor woman was, was really
struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people, myself included some
nights, and I don't know why get up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, three, four in the morning and
you feel a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, reapply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I keep my little jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, on the countertop in the
bathroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I have to in the middle of the
night, if I, you know, use the bathroom,
[SPEAKER_01]: get up, put a little bit more on my hand,
massage my leg and go back to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you mentioned, this isn't,
this isn't your product or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one that you found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it developed for this purpose or was
it something that you kind of lucked into?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's something again, that I just
started thinking about CBDA is an amazing
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDA is anything, you know, there's a
song, anything you can do, I can do
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything CBD can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe CBDA can do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is a way better
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is specific on COX-2 as opposed to
COX-1 and two, which CBD does both.
[SPEAKER_01]: COX-2 is mostly, you know, inflammation,
which as a pain reliever, is fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was originally developed for
pain relief, for topical pain relief,
[SPEAKER_01]: better than Voltaren, better than steroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of its anti-inflammatory
nature, I put it on mosquito bites,
[SPEAKER_01]: rashes, you know, any type of like
sunburn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunburn even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, and it works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of my restless leg and my
continued research into understanding how
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the cannabinoid molecules work,
you know, cause I constantly researching
[SPEAKER_01]: this, when I'm, I bumped into an article
that talked about mechanoreceptors,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I was looking at, huh, which
cannabinoids interact with
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanoreceptors because a stretch
receptors, mechanoreceptor, I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: restless leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how that, that was the rabbit
hole I jumped down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm like, CBDA, I know this
company because I use their products for
[SPEAKER_01]: patients for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I love CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, it's fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this particular formulation
penetrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got people who've got low back
pain from musculoskeletal issues and all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I give it to them for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm like, well, let's think about
restless leg is a, as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a, a therapeutic for this, you know,
indication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it worked on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did a, you know, a quickie
trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the goal now is to publish this,
hopefully get some money from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, either anyone out there who's
listening, who wants to participate and
[SPEAKER_01]: expand this clinical trial and,
or the NIH, you know, which we will be
applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: For grants, but it's interesting,
you know, you just can't apply for a grant
[SPEAKER_01]: with a big idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to actually show some proof of
concept, some inkling that it would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go figure the government wants to be
responsible at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, you know, here I, I think now we
at least have a signal that there's an N
[SPEAKER_01]: of 11, me and 10 other people where it
actually worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it would, you know,
once we publish it, we'll be able to then
[SPEAKER_01]: make application and expand it to a larger
number of participants to see if it truly
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can't put my nickel down and go,
see, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's efficacious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done because it's just 10 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 10 diverse people of different ages
and backgrounds and geo locations,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, along the, the U S but still
it's only 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would imagine different sort of
manifestations of, of symptoms too,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You had that one example of the woman who
was sort of experiencing it all day and
[SPEAKER_00]: others who might only at night or things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and, and that's the beauty of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, it, the, the, the cause of this is
not really well characterized and
[SPEAKER_01]: multifactorial.
[SPEAKER_01]: The symptoms of it, certainly
multifactorial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people struggle with it,
and yet blocking at the periphery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this thus far is the only,
uh, therapeutic I've seen specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: targeting at the periphery.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, think about, then you can,
who cares what the, the, the etiology is
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blocking it at the end organ where the
manifestation is and, and it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned too, that I,
if I heard you correctly, it sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: started happening after you had treatment
for, for your breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is there usually sort of like a
trigger or sort of an event in people's
[SPEAKER_00]: lives where that comes on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's not an uncommon thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so after my breast cancer,
I ended up in neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried me on a whole host of different
medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last of which was a drug that they use
like water now called tramadol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tramadol was initially developed
thinking it was just sitting on a opiate
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you wonder then you run one receptor,
um, as a pain reliever, but didn't cause
[SPEAKER_01]: respiratory depression or cardiac issues
because it had a ceiling effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you escalated it, that's how it
was built in the mid two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subsequently, they learned that this
medication also sits on GABA receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And serotonin receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you get off it, you're getting
off of three different receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you peel back that layer,
after being on a drug for a period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you know, serotonin receptors,
GABA receptors, those are the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are targeted therapeutic for restless leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I did something to those
receptors, I believe taking that medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That led me to this restless leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine if I got back on tramadol,
which I would never do, but I'm imagining
[SPEAKER_01]: if I did my restless leg symptoms may go
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't want to be on that drug.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, if you think of what I
said earlier, you know, the GABA receptor,
[SPEAKER_01]: serotonin receptor, the dopamine
receptors, all of those are what the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical companies are targeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a systemic drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I suppressed those receptors with the
medicine, thinking I was helping myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was recognizing my neuropathic pain
wasn't going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a year for me to withdraw from
this med.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was left with restless leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the neuropathic pain, is that
something that you're treating with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat with CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep that cream going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I use it topically and it helps
alleviate it dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, before I kind of get into like
the closing part, sorry, I just hit my
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you mentioned that you have kind of
geeky science notes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that we kind of touch
on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the geeky science was the
mechanoreceptors, the piezo receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That when this, so the name of the magic
sauce is CBDA, but they call it
[SPEAKER_01]: chylobinoid and chylobinoid is this
mixture of CBDA, CBD coordinated with
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium to make it amphoteric.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it were amphophilic, which means it
absorbs through in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also absorb in fat, lipid layers,
which allows for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And penetration, it looks specifically at
these membranes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interestingly enough, you don't have to
sit directly on a receptor in order for a
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor to be changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can change the membrane within which
the receptor is seated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So change that confirmation or that shape
of that membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore it changes the ability of
that receptor to respond properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I liken it to this, you're in a pool
and you're hanging out on a floaty thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, an inner tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picture the inner tube to be that,
you know, like that receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like something hanging on that
receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got this guy on the diving
board that just does a cannonball and it
[SPEAKER_01]: causes this huge wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he didn't hit me, but he caused a huge
change in the water that bounces me off
[SPEAKER_01]: that tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how CBDA regarding the
peripheral piezo receptors and some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other mechanoreceptors work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sitting directly on that receptor
that we know of yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we have so much more research to
really parse out, but the hypothesis is
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're changing this sort of
confirmation of the membrane, which in
[SPEAKER_01]: turn is changing the receptor's ability to
receive these signals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my geeky hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nice analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so winding down here,
I wanted to kind of just ask you what
[SPEAKER_00]: advice you'd give someone who's maybe
considering using cannabis as a treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: for restless leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say go onto a website called
KyloRelief.com and Kylo is CH1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a small bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like the lavender one because it
smells good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like lavender as opposed to
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are put off by the scent of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, this is an extract from the
plant, from the plant as it grows in
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not cannabinoids synthetically
derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the purists out there, just know
that there's some terpenes, so it does
[SPEAKER_01]: have a cannabinoid-y smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lavenderite, it also has linalool in it,
which is a terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all about the entourage effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got CBD, you've got other
terpenes in it, plus it's supplemented
[SPEAKER_01]: with lavender, which has linalool,
which is a no-musc relaxant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use CanMed20 in the coupon
code and get 20% off for any of you
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners out there that want to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would ask to reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to put my email into the
chat or whatever, what people listen to,
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to me and let me know how you
make out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love, love, love to use all of the
information from other people as
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences as an observational study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll definitely put those links in
the show description so people can easily
[SPEAKER_00]: find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other sort of resources or
resources available that we might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to point people to if they're interested
in learning more?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the Kylo Relief website,
there is a blog section that goes in-depth
[SPEAKER_01]: into the geeky science that I sort of
described here regarding the receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put up a white paper as to our
hypothesis as to how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be a good resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will share with you when the
publication is out and published and they
[SPEAKER_01]: can read the official publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully we'll get some money in
and be able to continue to run these
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many things we want to look
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so one, expanding our end,
of course, and two, really parsing out our
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism of action to prove what we
hypothesize, which is it truly is a
[SPEAKER_01]: peripheral mechanoreceptor, probably
either the TRIP-A1s or the PASOs or both,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've already been in conversation
with a university that has a skin model
[SPEAKER_01]: that allows us to examine translocation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks at, as well, it looks at
different receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just need funding for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Deb, thanks so much again for doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad to hear that you've gotten
some relief from your condition and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're helping others hopefully get some
relief as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for giving me this platform to
share this knowledge because it was great
[SPEAKER_01]: to present a poster at CAM-Med in Markle
Island this past May.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a huge amount of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been purchasing these.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been watching it and reaching out
to me and telling me how transformative it
[SPEAKER_01]: truly is, which I'm administering the
IRLS, that validated questionnaire post
[SPEAKER_01]: observation because people know what they
felt like and now they know what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will do that for anybody else that
wants to participate in this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just excited that this is now
going to reach even further for people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are listening to this podcast because the
risk is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefit potentially is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my passion is to try to heal the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one cannabinoid at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cannabis really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really proving to be a great
therapeutic for sort of these sort of edge
[SPEAKER_00]: cases or sort of difficult to treat
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as Dr. Ethan Russo, my cousin,
says, you know, it's like a pharmacy in a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an efficient pharmacy in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Deb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to see you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
