[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've gotten a lot of great
feedback from the announcement of our
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed 23 Innovation and Investment
Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't already heard, CanMed 23 is
going to be bigger and better than any of
[SPEAKER_00]: our previous events in a few very
important ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, as you've noticed, the name is a
little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now the CanMed 23 Innovation and
Investment Summit, which highlights both
[SPEAKER_00]: the nature of breakthroughs being
presented at the event and the inclusion
[SPEAKER_00]: of principles to fund those efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, CanMed 23 will be held at the
Marriott Resort at Marco Island,
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will give attendees like you the
chance to fit in a little R&R at one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most beautiful vacation venues in the
world, with amenities like world-class
[SPEAKER_00]: golf, tennis, yoga, massages on the beach,
and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, the summit will feature immersive
workshops to bring you up to speed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: latest in capital markets, medical
training, and deep dives into cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: and laboratory technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although CanMed 23 will be different in
these ways, some things will remain the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will still feature world-class oral
presentations in the areas of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing, curated by our CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: Advisory Board for impact and importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, our call for abstracts is open
now, and you can submit your abstract for
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration for a CanMed 23
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use the link in the show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also continue to share our
knowledge with the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_00]: through our CanMed archive, social media
platforms, and of course, the CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you can't join us in Marco
Island, you can still be part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed community.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you do want to join us at
CanMed 23, you can request your invitation
[SPEAKER_00]: now at canmedevents.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is David Traylor.
[SPEAKER_00]: David is the Senior Managing Director at
Golden Eagle Partners, a firm he
[SPEAKER_00]: originally founded to advise life science
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: After advising in various transactions in
the life science sector, he took an
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in the cannabis sector and
started advising cannabis companies before
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually refounding Golden Eagle
Partners in 2014 to focus on advising
[SPEAKER_00]: companies across the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before Golden Eagle Partners, David served
at leading investment banking firms,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Pacific Growth Equities,
Caris & Company, and Headwaters MB.
[SPEAKER_00]: During his banking tenures, he's advised
private and public biotechnology and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical device companies in various
transactions, including IPOs, public
[SPEAKER_00]: offerings, private offerings, and mergers
and acquisitions totaling over $500
[SPEAKER_00]: million in value.
[SPEAKER_00]: David and Golden Eagle Partners will host
a capital markets workshop at CanMed 23,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will explore a global perspective of
the hurdles, issues, and concepts around
[SPEAKER_00]: funding cannabinoid and cannabis
innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discussed the
current cannabis investment outlook,
[SPEAKER_00]: the challenges cannabis innovators face
when raising capital, how federal
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition affects innovation and
investment into cannabis technologies,
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging international markets that may
eventually outpace the U.S., and a preview
[SPEAKER_00]: of the capital markets workshop taking
place at CanMed 23.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my interview with David,
I want to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Eagle Partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Eagle Partners are transactional
experts that have combined experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: the early stages of cannabis and life
science sectors, which help them
[SPEAKER_00]: confidently close strategic and financial
transactions that match the near and
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term goals of their clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They specialize in mergers, acquisitions,
reverse mergers, financings, and
[SPEAKER_00]: incremental transactions such as
licensing, joint ventures, and
[SPEAKER_00]: co-development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at GoldenEaglePartners.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any further ado, please join
my conversation with David Trailer.
Good morning, David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Monday indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to talk with you today about
investment in cannabis innovations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've talked with many researchers
and innovators over the years on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and seen them at CanMed really
working on moving the industry forward
[SPEAKER_00]: through new discoveries and new
innovations.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they need capital and investment
to bring those discoveries and
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where firms like you at Golden
Eagle Partners can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was hoping, could you tell us a bit
about the cannabis companies that you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are working with and what you help them
do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, a thing to start off,
and maybe before we talk about golden
[SPEAKER_01]: eagle partners in specific, is really what
is the definition of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think, you know, this industry
is so crazy and part of that craziness
[SPEAKER_01]: results from the fact that everybody's got
their own nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our perspective is, you know, it's derived
from the fact that cannabis is the genus
[SPEAKER_01]: of this wonderful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we consider cannabis,
we're not just talking marijuana or THC
[SPEAKER_01]: plus preparations, whatever you want to
call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe cannabis is all-encompassing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of things stemming from the plant,
whether it's THC plus, what we call THC
[SPEAKER_01]: plus or marijuana preparations,
THC minus, which then we break it down
[SPEAKER_01]: into industrial hemp and then what we call
molecular hemp, like CBD, CBG,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, CBN, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been, so Golden Eagle Partners,
the firm, we started jumping in and we
[SPEAKER_01]: jumped into cannabis in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, Ben, we've been very lucky
about what we've been doing and where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're at now, because I could have never
predicted when I was getting my undergrad
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees of biochem and molecular bio at CU
Boulder in the eighties that I'd be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up, I ended up jumping into
biotech companies, operational roles for
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 years at companies in Boulder,
Berlin, Germany, Silicon Valley,
[SPEAKER_01]: and did all the way through project
management into business development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also lucky enough to invent around
three patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of those are bioprocessing and
everybody knows bioprocessing is a big
[SPEAKER_01]: part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry, whether you're calling it THC
plus, minus whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into investment banking or jumped
into investment banking 2005 in San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco, doing biotech deals and came
back to Colorado where I'm originally from
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2009 and then 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Found a Golden Eagle Partners and
everybody know that's when Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado kicked things off with adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2013, we started advising companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2014, I was advising a company called
Serna.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were one of the first three public
companies in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was jumped in at full time as
their chief business officer and did that
[SPEAKER_01]: for about a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through that experience Ben realized
that it was, it's not easy to find good
[SPEAKER_01]: capital for good cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't easy then, and it's not easy
now, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after leaving Serna, we actually,
I reactivated my registrations with FINRA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both Matt Doherty and I, Matt works
with me over here at GP are both
[SPEAKER_01]: registered with FINRA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've helped, we've done 25 deals in
the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We helped Pharmacan raise 30 million in
2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also helped a company called
Panacea leading hemp processor race,
[SPEAKER_01]: do a $14 million upfront strategic deal in
2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've talked around the US from San
Francisco, San Diego, the Hamptons,
[SPEAKER_01]: Miami, Denver, but also internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked on cannabis in Toronto twice,
Grand Cayman, Frankfurt twice,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dubai in 2018, Davos in 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the world economic crisis,
we had an international forum and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsored an event in Berlin just a month
and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had our first Israeli client
in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd been doing international Ben for
over six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also lucky enough, as I
mentioned, we'd just been lucky with my
[SPEAKER_01]: whole life about where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I also played pro lacrosse back in
the late eighties with the field first
[SPEAKER_01]: field lacrosse league.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I joined athletes for care
about five, six years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm an athlete ambassador for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they asked me a year and a half
ago to be the chairman of their scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: advisory council.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I work, put together a group with
some of the leading lights in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, like Ethan Rousseau,
Deb Kimlis, Guillermo Moreno Sanz from
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain and Raquel Perubet from Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we kind of pull this whole thing
together as a long-winded explanation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to your point too, the one thing
that's interesting Ben is that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: really understand and have been in biotech
and now where cannabis is going,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's going more towards
molecules all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta eight, whether you hate it or like
that molecule, that's kind of an
[SPEAKER_01]: indication that this industry is going
more towards molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in the entourage effect,
but I think we're going to need to
[SPEAKER_01]: deconvolute a lot of these things,
which gets to your question, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the last company, biotech
company I worked at, we were one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leading systems biology companies and we
couldn't do a $20 million series B.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to do an inside round of 6
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost my job and so did 30% of the people
in the company because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand full well from that
experience, Ben, that I don't care how
[SPEAKER_01]: good your technology is and how many
patents you have, you don't have money,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to add to that innovation is extremely
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: R&D takes money and you got to sink money
in for hoping something comes down the
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to add to that, from my
experience being an inventor on three
[SPEAKER_01]: patents, just because you have a patent,
most patents don't monetize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we have a unique skill set,
as I mentioned, to talk to companies
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world, whether they're in THC
plus, THC minus, most of the companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that are really going to get above the
noise, whether it's here internationally,
[SPEAKER_01]: have to innovate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a good way to get that right is IP,
intellectual property patents,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, trademarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one of the things we're
doing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very tough funding environment,
but I think the smart money is looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: the future and part of that future is
innovation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer your question?
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good segue because,
I mean, that's what CanMed is all about,
[SPEAKER_00]: is bringing together innovators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why we're really happy to
have Golden Eagle Partners be part of
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed 23, because you're leading a
pre-conference workshop on capital markets
[SPEAKER_00]: to help these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you planning to cover?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you planning to cover in that
workshop and why should attendees make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure they don't miss it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the one thing that I think
a good justification to talk about why we
[SPEAKER_01]: jumped in and doing this is, you know,
we've been sponsoring and we looked at,
[SPEAKER_01]: we just had a discussion this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've sponsored over 30 events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, we just sent an email to
somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't attend events unless we sponsor
and we participate and I'm on a panel,
[SPEAKER_01]: frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because we want to continue to be
a KOL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when CanMed came up, we talked to
Brendan and I was one of the first finance
[SPEAKER_01]: people to talk at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Brendan said, hey, when we're at
CanMed this year, we're looking to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: capital markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we have a pretty
significant advantage in what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, because this came out of
talking to Brendan and other people I
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk to other transactional groups or
investment banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a cannabis group and they have a
biotech group, but they don't have a group
[SPEAKER_01]: that combines both like we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our whole idea was, you know,
if we're really going to be the real deal
[SPEAKER_01]: and not lose this advantage we have,
we need to be the lead sponsor at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we jumped into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what we want to do with CanMed
and a matter of fact, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're on the same page with
medicinal genomics team on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're part of the thing we want to pattern
after is red herring, which many of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the tech and the biotech space,
the old guard understand red herring was a
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine in the eighties and nineties that
really took root in all the tech
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation that went on in Silicon Valley
and around the world at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And red herring was a very cool
amalgamation of really a lot of cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: edge technologies, finance, you know,
because again, you know, all this
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation is expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want CanMed to be essentially
something like that, where it's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be talking about capital markets,
about capital funding, transactional
[SPEAKER_01]: options, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also going to talk to the extent
on what new technologies are coming down
[SPEAKER_01]: the pipe, what technologies are currently
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, are you talking
ancillary to cannabis or deep into
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis where you'd like to talk about
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be a very
interesting thing over time that evolves
[SPEAKER_01]: and certainly want to have the
international component to it to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what companies are doing,
what things in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, too, Ben, this this
industry is quickly, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing up into different little sectors
and subsectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to make sure that we're
covering, you know, the technology side,
[SPEAKER_01]: the the management side, a lot of the
operational side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is really going to relate to where
we're at now with technology innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then where is it going to be in the
next year, year and a half?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's a good question to ask
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what what technologies and news do you
think we're going to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe what do you think we're going to see
before CanMed in May?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything in particular you think
will be coming out?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think one of the things that I
mentioned in Frankfurt, Ben, is our
[SPEAKER_01]: thought is, you know, we don't believe
there's really a crystal ball for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and we talked to a well-known lawyer
in the space in Berlin, and he had a
[SPEAKER_01]: different perspective that he believes
there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, though, and I agree with him
to some extent that you can appreciate and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of predict maybe where certain
geographies are going to have like states
[SPEAKER_01]: or countries how it's going to evolve over
time, starting with medical and then going
[SPEAKER_01]: into adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think being a being an advisor and
looking at companies trying to tell what's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming down the road in different things,
especially when you're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: technology is next to impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, our expectation,
fortunately or unfortunately, the FDA is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably going to come out with some type
of guidance, whether it's on cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, CBD between now and next May.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know if it's going to be good or
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I'm completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we don't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we think definitely, to my earlier
point, that the molecular side is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to be important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we believe in the entourage effect
and a lot of times one plus one plus one
[SPEAKER_01]: equals five.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, you know, for example,
the Delta eight side and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, obviously, CBG and a number of
things coming to the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked to a company in Boston last week
at ICDP that has a really interesting THC
[SPEAKER_01]: analog is doing as some really interesting
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more importantly, too, I think we need
to really explore the human side.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of time and effort been
put into the plant genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how really if you look at a chemo
bar strain, whatever you want to call it,
[SPEAKER_01]: we call them chemo bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody says it's one thing,
a lot of times it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the side that really has not had a lot
of effort put into it is the human side,
[SPEAKER_01]: the human genetics, because each person
does act differently with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the endocannabinoid system itself is a
unique system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a company called
Endocannabinoid Health that's doing some
[SPEAKER_01]: very interesting things that we worked
with in the past on looking at person's
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic background and makeup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that that's going to continue
to be a big part of the cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the next six to 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole phenomena of cannabis affecting
people differently, the same products
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually at a family party this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were having a conversation about that
very thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the other thing, too,
is, you know, Ben, the cool thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're trying to do at GEP, Goliath
Partners, is to provide money to companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going to generate the data to
move this industry forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everybody knows, you know,
I know, everybody that's listening to this
[SPEAKER_01]: knows somebody or themselves where they've
given a certain preparation to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, oh, my God, you know,
there's a woman I worked and got to know
[SPEAKER_01]: at the local bank who was taking Ambien
and Iqal every night, couldn't sleep and
[SPEAKER_01]: went through a number of different things
with her and gave her Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: She said it changed her life.
[SPEAKER_01]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the funding to do the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're sort of wading in
the waters with these massive
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical companies who just have
boatloads of cash to innovate and to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, generate data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we need to keep up somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and also one thing real quick,
Ben, that that kind of gets to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: of and I mentioned this with Brendan
McKernan from your firm last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the target audience for CanMed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what we can, if we do it
right, I think we ought to be getting
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much a whole spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully people that have used some of
these preparations and have found an
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing result from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, you know, leading finance
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have operational people in
companies, whether plant touching or
[SPEAKER_01]: non-plant touching, whether they're
science based or non-science based.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other people ancillary,
you know, to that, whether it's IP lawyers
[SPEAKER_01]: or or accountants, what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the the topics that we're going to
cover, our goal whenever we do something
[SPEAKER_01]: like this or sit down in front of people,
Ben, is hopefully the goal is that people
[SPEAKER_01]: walk out of the room and don't say that
was a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I firmly believe that CanMed is is
going to be a really it's the first of its
[SPEAKER_01]: kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe if we do it right, it's going to
be the first of its kind in cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to the investor side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what sort of technologies are investors
interested in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, what's sort of like the
climate for investment in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sector right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just talking to somebody today that,
you know, the only other climate funding
[SPEAKER_01]: and climate funding climate that I've seen
similar to this since I've been,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, doing transactions for 15 to 20
years, whether it's business development
[SPEAKER_01]: or investment banking, what have you,
is 2008, 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously cannabis, there were,
you know, obviously cannabis operators,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, doing things THC plus THC
minus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, it really got going,
as we mentioned in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the first real legal
sales of REC in Colorado were January 1,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was six years before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, yeah, is the worst funding
environment that we've ever seen for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people would listen to this
would agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, there is there is
capital out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be creative, persistent,
persevere and look to different sources of
[SPEAKER_01]: capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you have to be smart about,
you know, not putting your valuation out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and kind of go into the market with
various different structures to be
[SPEAKER_01]: creative on that side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's kind of what we
typically tell our clients and people
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking to about being our clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very tough, but I think there is
money out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I think you're going to continue
to have new groups that are on the outside
[SPEAKER_01]: looking in, right, or new companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: New firms, for example, this week I'm
reaching out to a lot of the biotech VCs,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, that I've known for the last
few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we finally have a few companies that I
think would pique their interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's always a phone call
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a tough environment,
but I think if you're out there looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for money, it's there to be had.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to be smart about how much
you want to raise and how you go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is the tough climate, is it mainly
just the state of the economy or is it a
[SPEAKER_00]: souring on the cannabis industry in
general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have to be careful with this
because I don't want to piss too many
[SPEAKER_01]: people off, but I think it's, well,
it's a lot of different factors
[SPEAKER_01]: personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, having been at it so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, part of it is the fact that
frankly the industry is kind of a shit
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or sorry, dumpster fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can edit out or put in whatever you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea is that you have,
for example, 280E, which is very tough and
[SPEAKER_01]: other industries don't deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that puts pressure on margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, you have a lot of people that
jumped in this early that thought it was
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is easy to grow weed, but it's
really, really hard to grow really good
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have all these different regulatory
requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the fact that there's a patchwork
across states where if you want to go into
[SPEAKER_01]: different states, you have to build the
same essentially functionality,
[SPEAKER_01]: which costs money, which essentially leads
to diseconomies of scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most industries have economies of scale
when they build bigger and better and
[SPEAKER_01]: brighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't happen in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, another part of it,
I think, Ben, is the fact that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: money, not all money in this industry is
smart money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of people and they
were investing a lot of these public
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the assumption was, okay, well,
Biden's in the White House, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pot's gonna be legalized in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it's gonna be
hunky dory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that didn't happen last year,
all of a sudden the bloom is off the rows
[SPEAKER_01]: and people have ran screaming for the
exits, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which in itself is, excuse me,
is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think over time that's going to
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think to me, well, the other thing
to add to that is the legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: question that I think we talked about
covering.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main key things we would like
to talk about is, you know, both my
[SPEAKER_01]: parents were politicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never advise a company to define
their strategy around what politicians may
[SPEAKER_01]: or may not do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes from a well, educated
background in Silicon Valley, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, I think what companies
were telling companies is just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: operating and surviving through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with regards to the legalization
question, too, we don't think it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: happen in the next two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe something like SAFE or something
comes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, again, it gets back to the
2018 Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that passed in December 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then December 2019, one of our clients
was shipping hemp from Oklahoma to
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truck ran a stoplight in Oklahoma
and got pulled over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden the police in
Oklahoma thought it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest drug bust in state history and
thought it was marijuana or TH,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want to call it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And not hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main point is, you know,
they didn't get the memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the same thing is gonna happen
when they try to legalize it here in the U
[SPEAKER_01]: .S.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cannabis is such a unique industry
that crosses so many federal agencies DEA,
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA, IRS, Fed, you know, shall I go on,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to try to address all those
complexities and do it right in a piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: one or two pieces of legislation,
I'm pretty much sure that they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: screw it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody thinks if legalization
happens, it's gonna be a nice black and
[SPEAKER_01]: white.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden everything's hunky dory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I think that's a pipe dream.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to be such a downer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the people that are gonna be
surviving in this industry, the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are perseverance and really stick to it
are gonna make money in the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's, you know, it's not gonna be easy
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, agreed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sort of discussed the challenges in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, it is the largest cannabis
market by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about international markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one of those are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of those are you paying attention
to?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we one thing that is frankly helped
us over the last two years with the
[SPEAKER_01]: pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, the pandemic's really helped us,
Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate the fact that it hasn't
helped everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a matter of fact, I have two
daughters and it's been very tough on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely my thoughts are out to
people that have not had such an easy time
[SPEAKER_01]: in the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, it's been a benefit on the fact
that, you know, we were doing
[SPEAKER_01]: international as mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in Davos in January 2020 right
before the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pandemic shut things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the only cannabis investment bank
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canaccord was there a year before and
didn't make it in 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we weren't able to travel the last
couple of years, but we had Zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had the excuse to say, hey,
guys, you know, we can't make it to Davos
[SPEAKER_01]: like we did or Dubai, but let's jump on
the Zoom call.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in the last 12 months or so,
we've talked to operators in Mongolia and
[SPEAKER_01]: Macedonia, Lesotho, South Africa,
Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand, Greece, Cyprus, I mean,
Canary Islands, we could go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we believe we're certainly a global
leader in cannabis finance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're interested in a lot of
different markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think South America is very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly Europe is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing, though, that I did mention
in Davos that I think most people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: in the know in this industry have been
around the block and will fully accept and
[SPEAKER_01]: agree that pretty much most geographies,
when you roll them out, whether it's a new
[SPEAKER_01]: market or whatever, it's going to take
more time than you expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you look in the U.S.,
same thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York, it's going to take longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sure that Florida did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Illinois really didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But California has taken some time to roll
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look at Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Spain has taken forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: UK has been on a slow burn forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: France.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany is, you know, making some noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly that's one reason why I went
to Frankfurt, Berlin this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, we believe, certainly could be
the legal or the real linchpin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a lot of people are saying how Germany
goes is how Europe is going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, back to that original point,
I mean, the scuttlebutt in Germany is that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're probably looking at adult use in
early, late 2023 or early 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most likely is the points I just
mentioned is probably going to be past
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just for some reason, you know,
there's a lot of reasons, but it usually
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of pushes, pushes, pushes out on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, Germany's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: A matter of fact, we're going to moderate
a panel during MJ Biz in Las Vegas with
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the leading German operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, Germany's a very interesting
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you never know this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe all of a sudden South
America will light up or Australia is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely doing some interesting things,
certainly on the medical side,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but one other point, too, I want to
mention on this question, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: market right now is potentially and
probably, you know, the biggest market,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially with adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, with all the problems the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: has, as we've just discussed, and if other
countries like Germany really skirt those
[SPEAKER_01]: or don't deal with those and are allowed
to grow in a different set of regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're not regulating cannabis in
the different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Germany, like Baden-Württemberg,
et cetera, Bavaria, it's national,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Canada has done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could make, you know, the U.S.,
if the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned this in my talk in
Frankfurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's no guarantee the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: market is going to be the biggest,
baddest cannabis market in the world in
[SPEAKER_01]: the coming years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may stay that way, but our politicians
have to frankly get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: their stuff together and help out the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think everybody in this industry
appreciates the fact that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: impedances that we've talked about,
and we need to get rid of some of those to
[SPEAKER_01]: really help the industry get to where it
should be, frankly, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you're looking at these
different countries, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: going back to innovation, which ones do
you think are the furthest along in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, coming out with new
innovations for the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's got to be Israel, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel's been at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Rafi Meshulam, elucidated,
you know, THC and structure in 1964.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the one thing that we can
also bring up in CanMed that I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at really the evolution of
biotechnology and this question you have
[SPEAKER_01]: on innovations, I think appropriate place
to cover it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, biotech, they, Watson and Crick
found the DNA structure of DNA in 1953.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 20 years later in 1973,
you had Cohen and Boyer with their seminal
[SPEAKER_01]: technology, recombinant technology
discovery that Stanford made a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: money out of, frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, five years later from
that, it's 1978, you had Genentech go do
[SPEAKER_01]: an IPO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had, you know, this
burgeoning blow up of biotech in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: eighties into the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you counter that with,
you know, cannabis and innovation in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis really has been slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it seems like maybe that's
because I've never thought about this
[SPEAKER_01]: before, but maybe it's a problem because
everybody that works in cannabis smokes
[SPEAKER_01]: too much cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's slow moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't get off the gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, as I mentioned, Rafi Meshulam
finds THC or its structure and defines
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think isolated in 1964.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had, I think it was 1985
where he had Marinol get accepted for
[SPEAKER_01]: market by the FDA or approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 1993, you had the identification
or early nineties anyway, the elucidation
[SPEAKER_01]: of the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how many years ago was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then almost 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then you've had a number of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think was it 2008 when you had
Epidiolex approved?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just, innovation has to be,
there's got to be more rapidity and
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker development of cannabis
innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to start happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that's, I think going to be
due to new capital coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully the idea is to catalyze some
of that with the capital markets day at
[SPEAKER_01]: Canmin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and it all comes back to regulations
and the legality of it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I got to think that that's got to
be an impediment to innovation and
[SPEAKER_00]: investment too, I would think is,
you know, that this, especially in the U S
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this gray area of, okay,
it's legal in my state, but it's not legal
[SPEAKER_00]: federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I really want to get into
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of things that I
think on that point were interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I first jumped into it in
2013 and, you know, 2014 at Serna,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it was not easy to find good
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of people back then,
and it's definitely changed, but they were
[SPEAKER_01]: like, okay, well, if I get into this,
it jump into cannabis or marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: company, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's on my resume.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody had the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously I think that stigma is certainly
going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a number of respects, but I mean,
if you look back on the conversations I
[SPEAKER_01]: was having with some groups, a company
here in Colorado that was doing some
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting thing with plant genetics and
they'd looked at cannabis and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: 2013, 2014, but they were like,
yeah, we're staying the hell away from,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because we talked to some people
that were patent examiners and USPTO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then the idea of Ben with patents
was, well, if you're a cannabis company,
[SPEAKER_01]: good luck with it because the only group
that had a patent issued in cannabis at
[SPEAKER_01]: that time was the US government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the people were saying,
well, you can't really get a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: patent through USPTO or the fact that,
you know, if it does get litigated or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, it has to go into a court of law
and they're not going to accept it because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's cannabis and national illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That certainly has changed now because
yeah, there's a lot of people now applying
[SPEAKER_01]: for patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, it takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thought is, you know, it's
unfortunately it's taken more time than
[SPEAKER_01]: we've really wanted it to, but innovation
also, as we've talked about, takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winding down here and before I let you
go, David, I wanted to give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to plug any websites or social
media, or just resources that the
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners can, can go to, to learn more
about what it is you guys do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, really what we do, we're
transactional experts.

Google my name, I mean, we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool thing about Davos is I got mentioned
in an article in Rolling Stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to Google Rolling Stone and
a weed grows in Davos, you can look that
[SPEAKER_01]: up or certainly Bloomberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been mentioned in Bloomberg and a
number of other, Yahoo, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of resources or look us
up, send me an email or give me a call.
