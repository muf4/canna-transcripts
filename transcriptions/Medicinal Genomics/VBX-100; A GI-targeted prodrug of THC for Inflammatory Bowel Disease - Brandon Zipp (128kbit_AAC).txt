[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Brandon zip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the director of R&D and the scientific
co-founder for vitality biopharma today
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk to you about this novel
pro drug that we're developing for
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammatory bowel disease So first off
yes, I'm an employee of the company and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know our lawyer has required me to put
this safe harbor statement, so If you have
[SPEAKER_01]: any questions check out our website or our
public filings So diving right into it so
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammatory bowel disease So really for
those of you who don't are you not
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a umbrella term It includes both
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
[SPEAKER_01]: These are both chronic inflammatory
disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an overactive immune response.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's attacking the intestinal epithelium
of the the intestine so So there are no
[SPEAKER_01]: cures for IBD This is something that these
patients are going to live with their
[SPEAKER_01]: entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it needs to be treated and managed And
some of the side effects that are seen in
[SPEAKER_01]: IBD patients Yeah, chronic inflammation
diarrhea abdominal pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of pain As well as there's
also morphological there's strictures
[SPEAKER_01]: fistulas and other problems also higher
incidence of colon cancer So The
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalence of the of IBD in the United
States is is really high so 1.3 percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans That's over 3 million Americans
that are affected by IBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's prevalent also in Western diet and
other Western lifestyles So the current
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment goals for IBD consists of
initially Inducing remission and then also
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining it So sort of a first line
would be you know prescription of
[SPEAKER_01]: corticosteroids to put out the fires and
decrease the initial inflammation But of
[SPEAKER_01]: course that can't be used indefinitely You
have other small molecules like the amino
[SPEAKER_01]: salicylates and you get into the
immunosuppressants And immunosuppressants
[SPEAKER_01]: work well Except for the the side effects
of suppressed immune system and risk of
[SPEAKER_01]: infections You also have the infliximab
and adalumumab which are the biologics
[SPEAKER_01]: which are anti TNF alpha inhibitors,
which you know Ethan kind of touched on
[SPEAKER_01]: and so Despite all of these options,
you know IBD patients are still facing you
[SPEAKER_01]: know 25 to 40 percent of IBD Patients will
face surgery to remove part of their
[SPEAKER_01]: bowels to deal with this disease You know,
some of these patients are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: require Iliostomy bags and some for the
rest of their lives and all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: despite the fact that you know We as as
Americans we spend ten billion dollars a
[SPEAKER_01]: year treating IBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just woefully inadequate for the
disease state and we have a family friend
[SPEAKER_01]: who their little daughter has Crohn's
disease and Watching her go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments and she finally has it under
control But it's just heartbreaking to
[SPEAKER_01]: watch what happens to the patients as well
as the families and so We So another
[SPEAKER_01]: troubling trend is that opioid use or
opioid prescriptions for IBD Have been
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing so on the left you can see over
the 23 years have been monitored this
[SPEAKER_01]: steady increase in use of Opioids
including strong opioids and this is adult
[SPEAKER_01]: data out of England The same data is clear
in the United States If not more so and
[SPEAKER_01]: this I pulled the statistic out of a
recent paper and a couple months ago that
[SPEAKER_01]: in the United States nearly 20% of
adolescents so 19 to 30 Have been have
[SPEAKER_01]: received a chronic opioid therapy to
address their chronic intestinal pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: so
[SPEAKER_01]: Enough of the depressing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is can med.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about cannabis And so one
really interesting resource is that
[SPEAKER_01]: Crohn's disease patients have this online
forum called chronology org in which they
[SPEAKER_01]: can discuss sort of the they can discuss
what they're going through treatments that
[SPEAKER_01]: are working for them and they can rate the
how effective the medications,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that they're trying and how it's
working for them and so if you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: this the Number-one most effective
reported treatment is medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is above this is above both the
best-in-class anti TNF alpha antibodies on
[SPEAKER_01]: number two and further down so What is the
data supporting the use of cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: IBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the studies that have been
performed have been more observational due
[SPEAKER_01]: to the inability to directly prescribe But
also because of the varied legal status
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's clear is that so on the left
store has reported that you know in
[SPEAKER_01]: patients with Crohn's disease that are
receiving medical cannabis They have
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased abdominal pain cramping joint
pain and diarrhea similarly Workout of
[SPEAKER_01]: Timna naftali's group has shown that for
an eight-week course of cannabis She sees
[SPEAKER_01]: significant decreases in the Crohn's
disease activity index.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over on the right so there's this trend
downward in Their inflammation and their
[SPEAKER_01]: disease status and one really cool thing
about on the right Is that the patients
[SPEAKER_01]: that were taking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Opioids for their you know chronic
intestinal pain were able to come off of
[SPEAKER_01]: them during the course of the study
Shifting from Crohn's disease to
[SPEAKER_01]: ulcerative colitis You know similar
results have been seen during an
[SPEAKER_01]: eight-week course of treatment with
medical cannabis You see an improvement in
[SPEAKER_01]: the colitis scores as seen by colonoscopy
As well as on the table on the right shows
[SPEAKER_01]: that when patients are receiving medical
cannabis They're able to go off of their
[SPEAKER_01]: other IBD medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So This all looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is the what's the catch?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a report that came out that was I
think 2017 this came out and this was
[SPEAKER_01]: funded by GW Pharma It's a great study and
they were using a CBD rich botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: extract But they didn't meet their so the
data looks very suggestive But they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: meet their primary endpoints because the
patients stopped taking the drug So they
[SPEAKER_01]: had non-adherence and when you look at
what they were giving the patients So they
[SPEAKER_01]: were escalating these patients up to an
oral dose of CBD that contained up to 23
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half migs of THC daily So the
patients were reported dizziness and
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactivity and they just stopped
taking what they were supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: taking so Psychoactivity is a real problem
in patients That they don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to address this vitality has
developed a New class of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're familiar with
endocannabinoids As well as phyto
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, of course And then so we
have created this new category that are
[SPEAKER_01]: called cannabocides or cannab cannabinoid
glycosides in which we functionalized
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids through the hydroxyl hydroxyl
on the resource normal ring with sugars
[SPEAKER_01]: and So we do this With proprietary enzyme
and a method and we're performing this
[SPEAKER_01]: production of these cannabocides at our
DEA approved R&D facility outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: Sacramento So we've we've generated a
library of almost 150 of unique
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid glycosides with different
structures and base molecules and Our lead
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate right now is VBX 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a THC molecule that's been
functionalized with three different
[SPEAKER_01]: glucoses on it For the chemists in the
room like Jonathan so one main change with
[SPEAKER_01]: this when we glycosylate it The the water
solubility increases greatly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have decreased hydrophobicity And
it's seen by three log orders a change or
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement over THC When we occupy that
hydroxyl group on the resource normal
[SPEAKER_01]: ring, we also see a stability increase So
these compounds are more resistant to
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation And also another chemistry
term is that these molecules now have this
[SPEAKER_01]: big Polar sugar head, but they still have
the hydrophobic THC backbone and tail and
[SPEAKER_01]: so the chemistry term for that is
amphipathic or two faces and one
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting thing that results from that
is that They no longer are totally happy
[SPEAKER_01]: in a lipid or solvent environment But
they're also not totally happy in an
[SPEAKER_01]: aqueous or water environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see decreased association with
membranes we also see that they no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: bind to the receptors or transporters and
so the Main result of this is that these
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds stay in the gut so they don't
get absorbed So they stay in the gut and
[SPEAKER_01]: They transit through to the large
intestine and then we see something really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool happen so VBX 100 with these sugars
on it makes it to the large intestine and
[SPEAKER_01]: They're these enzymes so they encounter
hung hungry microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Ethan's talk is a great primer
for this So we have a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: gut microbes Predominantly, you know,
they encounter the steep increase of the
[SPEAKER_01]: distal ilium and the colon and when they
encounter that these Hungry microbes are
[SPEAKER_01]: secreting these enzymes that pop the
sugars off and release THC and then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not absorbed So the THC we have a
site-directed delivery of THC to the lumen
[SPEAKER_01]: of the large intestine These glycoside pro
drugs it's a pro drug in that it's THC
[SPEAKER_01]: glycoside That then delivers and so it
gets activated and it delivers THC where
[SPEAKER_01]: we want This glycoside pro drum pro drug
paradigm is nothing new so All of these
[SPEAKER_01]: are examples of glycoside pro drugs that
target the intestines notably senesides,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are the main ingredient in senicot
or xlax Same mechanism they go to the gut
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the sugars get popped off and the
active is released So we have this drug
[SPEAKER_01]: that targets THC delivery To the large
intestine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to test how does this work
for ulcerative colitis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we turn to the predominant Colitis
model in rodents and so here you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: over on the left This is histopathology
information from the animals upper left is
[SPEAKER_01]: the sham or the untreated or sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a healthy intestines On the upper
right is TNBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if I've got this We have TNBS
plus the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the induced colitis Untreated
and then on the bottom we have Induced
[SPEAKER_01]: colitis and then treatment with either VBX
100 our novel THC pro drug or cyclosporine
[SPEAKER_01]: a which is an immunosuppressant And both
of them significantly significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: improve the colitis scores in these
histopathology So we also see Decreased
[SPEAKER_01]: myeloperoxidase which is an inflammatory
marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's neutrophils that are infiltrating
into the tissue There's less blood in the
[SPEAKER_01]: stools of these animals improved colon
morphology as well as stool consistency
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one hallmark of this model this
urine colitis TNBS induced model is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a severe shortening of the colons
and so These are some of the colons that
[SPEAKER_01]: we see and so on the left is the sham or
the healthy colon from the cecum from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cecum down to the anus and so vehicle is
the induced disease state that's untreated
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we did a dose-response curve with
our drug and so we See this nice dose
[SPEAKER_01]: response up into a point where we don't
get any additional benefit But we also
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see any toxicity incurred by these
higher doses and this is all compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: the immunosuppressant cyclosporine a and
so we're We're treating these as a pro
[SPEAKER_01]: drug and because they're so tightly
targeted to the large intestine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to greatly decrease the dose So
we're able to give these animals a very
[SPEAKER_01]: low dose and then potentiate or Get an
effect through the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: at physiological relevant concentrations
But we've also pushed this concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: really high and this sort of illustrates
how targeted it is to the gut And so we
[SPEAKER_01]: gave this thousand milligram per kilogram
dose to these rats And then we looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: the systemic plasma concentration for THC
that was released So we did see some but
[SPEAKER_01]: they peaked at an average of 20 nanograms
per mil Just for example, so a typical you
[SPEAKER_01]: know cannabis cigarette would give someone
or the average of like 16 nanograms per
[SPEAKER_01]: mil and To tie this in so what we gave
these animals would be the equivalent of a
[SPEAKER_01]: 75 kilo adult consuming 29 grams of pure
THC orally and only getting a mild I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know something so Because of this window
of where we're going to be dosing and the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that there's such low absorbance
Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's impressive how how little this
Gets absorbed and how much it stays
[SPEAKER_01]: targeted into the gut We've also done
pharmacology work that shows that the pro
[SPEAKER_01]: drug VBX 100 no longer binds to the
cannabinoid receptors or transporters like
[SPEAKER_01]: THC And so really it requires the site
directed hydrolysis in the large intestine
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to kind of gloss over
mechanism of action because Ethan kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: talked on this but TNF alpha this
inflammatory cytokine Has been shown to be
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased in endocannabinoid treatment or
cannabinoid treatment And there's also
[SPEAKER_01]: this novel mechanism of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of recent and that's a Jack
suppressor of cytokine signaling three
[SPEAKER_01]: induced decrease or inhibition of Jack
here And so I point these out because
[SPEAKER_01]: these are both blockbuster classes of
drugs And so it's intriguing that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids can have an impact on these
two classes There's also more recent
[SPEAKER_01]: information coming out of Beth McCormick's
lab at UMass supporting that an
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid feedback system is sort of
decreasing this pro-inflammatory Icosinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway, but I don't have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So come grab me if you want to talk about
this later So just in summary,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've made novel cannabinoid glycoside pro
drugs of THC They're targeted exquisitely
[SPEAKER_01]: to the large intestine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've demonstrated efficacy in an animal
model that's accepted and We have
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased binding to the receptors
transporters versus THC We're avoiding
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactivity because we're not even
getting to the brain Through this targeted
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery to the gut and we have local
anti-inflammatory action in the large
[SPEAKER_01]: intestine So we we envision that both THC
and VBX 100 playing a prominent role in
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment for IBD in the future Mostly
we're focused and interested in like
[SPEAKER_01]: decreasing the need for stereo steroids
and opioids three minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you And all of this with no
psychoactivity and we haven't and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: no adverse systemic like this isn't with
immunosuppressive action Or the systemic
[SPEAKER_01]: immunosuppressive action.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like standard the TNF alpha
inhibitors So very quickly just to point
[SPEAKER_01]: out so we have a number of compounds that
we have intellectual property on as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as So we're focused on VBX 100,
which is what I just talked to you today
[SPEAKER_01]: about And our main indication is
ulcerative colitis But Clostridium's we
[SPEAKER_01]: also have data if we have data on both
antimicrobial activity and Biocidal
[SPEAKER_01]: activity for cannabinoids versus
Clostridium difficile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see a avenue of use for these
infections of the gut IBS as well as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as an opioid induced narcotic bowel
syndrome So I'm excited to announce that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've received funding that will enable us
to start two phase two clinical trials on
[SPEAKER_01]: IBD and IBD IBS in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have exciting times ahead and With
that I'll wrap it up and say thank you so
[SPEAKER_01]: much for the opportunity to talk and thank
you to my team for and everyone at
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitality I've got one quick question the
microbial hydrolysis of these is it is it
[SPEAKER_00]: clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it what's left in the resourceful modi?
[SPEAKER_01]: It reverts back to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a complete removal of the the
carbohydrates Hi, thanks for the talk Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rousseau may be able to comment on this as
well, but there have been several studies
[SPEAKER_02]: done by GW pharmaceuticals using the
one-to-one set of X for multiple sclerosis
[SPEAKER_02]: neuropathic pain and the dropout rate is
far far far lower and I believe it's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably because they start with one
minute Milligrams and go up very slowly
[SPEAKER_02]: was where these patients start on 23
milligrams Of THC the first day in that
[SPEAKER_02]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was escalated to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the upper the upper end of the
trial And so once the patients encounter
[SPEAKER_01]: that dizziness and psychoactivity They
stuck with it, but they stopped taking
[SPEAKER_01]: what they were supposed to so,
you know If the botanical extract was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know supposed to be a certain amount
They were just taking half of it whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: made them feel good and had gave them
symptomatic relief So thank you You You
