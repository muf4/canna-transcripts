[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've already called a bunch of
friends and I said, you have to be there
[SPEAKER_01]: next year because this is high level
networking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're getting to talk to the
people that are innovating, that are
[SPEAKER_01]: making a huge difference in this industry
and pushing it forward with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: integrity.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no substitute for the face to
face opportunities that we've had this
[SPEAKER_04]: week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't go to a coffee station without
meeting somebody else who has a fantastic
[SPEAKER_04]: story, who would be very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: to what I do or that I'm able to help
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a great group of individuals
here and you keep seeing the same familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: faces time and time again and it's so
intimate that you can have a conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: with anybody just by walking across the
room and saying hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have made, you know, over a dozen
new connections that I think are
[SPEAKER_03]: meaningful that are bringing possibilities
to either teaming agreements or
[SPEAKER_03]: collaborations on future research and
development and business workings.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's refreshing to come here and see
like-minded people who understand the
[SPEAKER_05]: future of Canada business.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard today information that has not
been published from the people who are
[SPEAKER_04]: doing that work and they go into great
detail when you get them one-on-one into
[SPEAKER_04]: what they're doing later and the strategy
behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like being able to see over
the horizon and know where things are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be not in weeks and months,
but a year or two from now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the only place that's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so come.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not be disappointed by the
conversations, by the sessions,
[SPEAKER_01]: by the awesome dinners and networking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a fantastic experience and I'm
so happy that it came.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
