[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when did the Dent Institute get
involved in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And was that sort of a logical fit for you
guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Illogical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not logical in any way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only reason we got into it because we take
care of so many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when cannabis was made legal in New
York state about six, seven years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were getting phone calls, 500 a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, no, I have no idea about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a user.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to use alcohol, which makes
me tremendously boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point is the next day was another
500 phone calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third day, another 500 phone calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you run a business, you can
imagine how much money and energy that
[SPEAKER_01]: takes to answer those phone calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had said, look, let's get into
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make a clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start learning about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because our business model is so
private and not institutional,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're able to set up a cannabis clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the next six, seven years,
it took that amount of time to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the use of cannabis in patients with
neurological symptoms, including pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're self-taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical school?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't teach it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only good places to learn is at
these conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was honored to be at these
conferences everywhere from Tel Aviv to
[SPEAKER_01]: Malta, Europe and the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been part of this and I've been
learning as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I feel I have an expertise because
how do physicians understand medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to see patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now in the clinic, we have over
13,000 patients on cannabis for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't deal with recreational and I
need to emphasize that I'm purely on the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm purely there to legitimize this whole
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was there a light bulb moment or was
there a specific piece of evidence that
[SPEAKER_00]: you saw that kind of clicked in your head
that there's something to this cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as you're seeing patients,
as they come up to you and throw their
[SPEAKER_01]: arms around you and hug you, that's the
changing moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you found something where patients
said, you changed my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me off opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: My quality of life is improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with tears in their eyes, they're
hugging you and saying, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the moment that every physician
wants in their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got that in cannabis, interesting
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I deal with bad diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I deal with brain cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my specialties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you never get that moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it changed the way I practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still do brain tumor research and
treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do other things in neurology,
but cannabis has been an eye-opening
[SPEAKER_01]: moment where you can change the quality of
life of individuals by understanding how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis works on human beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
