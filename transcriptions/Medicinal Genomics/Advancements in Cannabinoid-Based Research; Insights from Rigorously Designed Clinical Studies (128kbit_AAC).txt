[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that was an excellent talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really excellent talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know I was going to have to
follow such a great talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Hunter Land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me again this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the organizers and all the
beautiful people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to speak today about some
advancements in cannabinoid-based research
[SPEAKER_00]: and give some insights from rigorously
designed studies and also some not so much
[SPEAKER_00]: rigorously designed studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was quicker than... What's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple disclosures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the industry about 20 years,
12 focused on cannabinoids since starting
[SPEAKER_00]: with GW Pharma in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the VP for BRC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also act as the Chief Scientific Officer
for the NHL alumni, as well as do some
[SPEAKER_00]: lecturing and sit on some other boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the interesting, I think
interesting section.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I'm going to talk... For those of
you that don't know, the FDA recently put
[SPEAKER_00]: out a publication on an update on INDs
around cannabis and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to just run through
that to give you kind of a glimmer into
[SPEAKER_00]: where the FDA is with current cannabis
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to talk about the
challenges of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think many of you are aware of these
challenges, but I'm going to put some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, not all of them, just kind of in one
place to help us understand how we really
[SPEAKER_00]: should be evaluating these publications
and how we may use that information and
[SPEAKER_00]: how that information may bring more
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I'm going to dive into
kind of the clinical trial update,
[SPEAKER_00]: talk a little bit about the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I'm going to discuss the
trial that we have ongoing, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: four that I can speak about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd hoped to provide you with data on this
study, but as you know, contracting with
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyers can take a little bit longer than
one might expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the FDA, long history with
FDA and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got about 800 INDs that have been
keyword submitted since 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 1970 to 2010, and then another 400,
so doubles from 2010 to 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: This represents about a 300% increase in
the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did state, kind of in the small
area, many submissions were unable to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: the IND requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't really tell us how many
were unable to meet, but many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I'll just point out here is
they have this nice graph, and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: this section over here, addiction and pain
is kind of lumped into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some questions about,
you know, how much of this is abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: liability work versus actually therapeutic
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll dive into that in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they had this other very interesting,
lovely graphical presentation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: changes throughout history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot, the first two decades
all smoked, and then we start seeing some
[SPEAKER_00]: other forms and formats come in,
and then lo and behold, look at this,
[SPEAKER_00]: like almost everything you can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got sweets and baked goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of INDs going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many of these have been
approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of them have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of INDs going on, different
formats, different constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have questions, which is normal for
me any time I read anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always have questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the questions I have here is how
many INDs around cannabinoids have
[SPEAKER_00]: actually been approved?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of these studies are looking at
therapeutic benefit versus risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I see a lot of studies on driving
or, you know, do you prefer this drug over
[SPEAKER_00]: that drug?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it addictive, et cetera, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if we're looking at cannabinoid
research for therapy, it may be smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: than represented here in this particular
publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then secondly, I would say how many of
these IMPs or these investigational
[SPEAKER_00]: medical products could actually become a
pharmaceutical?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know from conversations with the FDA,
smoked cannabis or even vaporized
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, the VOCs emitted will most
likely not ever meet the level of an
[SPEAKER_00]: approved drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's great, and there is,
you know, a very nice pathway to using
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis as an inhaled product as
far as being able to get that approved by
[SPEAKER_00]: the FDA and reimbursed by insurance,
it does not appear currently likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can argue about the merits of that
if you want, but that's the current FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: standing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe an inhalation device,
but again, I'm not aware of that
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly I think it would be tough to
have FDA approved THC cookies and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you dive down a little
further, then you wonder how many of these
[SPEAKER_00]: INDs were for specific products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically we would attach an
investigational new drug application to an
[SPEAKER_00]: indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for Epidiolex, there's Dravet,
there's Lennox-Gastaut, there's tuberous
[SPEAKER_00]: sclerosis, and a number of other
indications like Parkinson's and several
[SPEAKER_00]: other research studies that have used
Epidiolex, which would have different IND
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could have at least 10 or 15
different INDs for Epidiolex, same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: for Marinol, same thing for Sativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bucket of actual IND research for
therapeutics may be much smaller than is
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibited in this particular paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this does tell me is that the FDA
is supportive of cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We clearly have INDs, whether it's for
therapeutic benefit or whether it's for
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse liability, that have been approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have these approved right now
and have not had a big difficulty with the
[SPEAKER_00]: agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have to respond very quickly to
their questions, and that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: cumbersome at times, because they give you
a couple days maybe to give you those
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must meet the CMC standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people can't meet those standards,
but it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have sufficient documents,
so investigator brochures, protocols,
[SPEAKER_00]: ICFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't like something,
like recently they told me blood pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: above 150 needed to be blood pressure
above 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or below 140.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do make these kind of suggestions
around protocol design, not just CMC,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are just some forms,
1571, 1572, 3674, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a 30-day review period.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't go on clinical hold
after 30-day, you're free to run the
[SPEAKER_00]: trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could put you on clinical hold at any
time, but we haven't seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make sure you have sufficient time
to respond to these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got that out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend several hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have alerts on Google with every new
study that gets published.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell me what they're working on and
when it's going to be published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look at these, and I try to glean
knowledge about how this could translate
[SPEAKER_00]: to research and certain indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing that I find that just
is added variables for me understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: how to use these data are things like
route of administration, the product
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency, the format.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a control group?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does this impact the
interpretation of data?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say this often, cannabis is not
cannabis is not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all know that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you see a paper that says
cannabis treats pain, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, what cannabis are you using and what
pain are you studying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of different variables
just in that example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get significant variability based
on route of administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smoking for pain is different than oral
administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly vehicles can have a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look here, this is SEDS versus
MCT.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the record, MCT bypasses lymphatic
absorption and has the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailability of any lipid that you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you can see rapid absorption with
SEDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying you should use SEDS,
but clearly there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I take five milligrams of THC and
it's in SEDS format versus MCT,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I can expect a very different effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may lead to efficacy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 milligrams is not 10 milligrams is
not 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, lack of proper controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the outlier here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I wanna say is we see a lot of
studies that are where we look at research
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's with no control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of proof of concept, does this
work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say 10 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great because likely at a
minimum, you're gonna get a placebo
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20%, 30%, 10%, something.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just, even in studies where people
say, we're gonna give you a placebo and
[SPEAKER_00]: rate your pain, people still get
reductions in pain, even though they know
[SPEAKER_00]: they're taking a placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we're giving them
cannabis, so there's even a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for a placebo effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, yes, you may get a win in
your study, but if there's a side effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say you get a skin rash and there's
10 people, well then all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's disproportional to what may
actually happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a control group and you get
four skin rashes, well, maybe it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: the clinic and there was a skin fungus
going around, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have a control,
then essentially all that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to your drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, if you use these types of
studies to support a sponsor IND,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the FDA very much could say,
well, there's some serious safety concerns
[SPEAKER_00]: here based on your adverse event profile
because you have no control to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, actually, this is the same as
placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a laser, sorry for bombing,
I think I just shot you with the laser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is Satovac, so I try to pull
at least one variable out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a no medicine, it's consistent
at Satovac, and the title was effective
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids on neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I dove in and you can see here
pretty clearly you get some separation,
[SPEAKER_00]: so here's the line, and then as you move
this way, favors intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looks pretty good, generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dove in a little bit deeper,
and even though they're under the skies of
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathic pain, they're actually quite
different indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy,
rheumatoid arthritis, clearly different
[SPEAKER_00]: pathophysiologies there, MS-related pain,
alladenia, diabetic peripheral neuropathic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, MS-central neuropathic pain,
and peripheral neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same but different, and we're
seeing different changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you look here, DPMP,
not so good, but if I looked at MS pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just assumed that Satovac would work
for this, maybe not as much, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we have to be a little bit specific
and think about the etiology of pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe it does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was a study design issue,
but I don't think we can just say broadly
[SPEAKER_00]: this works the same across these
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly there's some variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is a really interesting
study, kind of builds on the indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Cersei's work, and I haven't seen
Cersei here, but I love this study because
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep seeing work on CBD, and a lot of
times the doses are what I would say far
[SPEAKER_00]: subtherapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what she did is she looked at all the
RCTs, and the green dots are success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the indications here,
and the orange dots are not successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she found is that the doses
typically for success acutely are between
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 and 1200 milligrams a day,
and when you have repeat dosing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see repeat dosing you probably
get kind of a higher level of steady
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this more or less confirms for most
conditions, you need much more CBD on
[SPEAKER_00]: board, or at least I would say to optimize
CBD's effect, I think we need much more
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see sometimes you use these
high amounts, and they still don't work,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that like schizophrenia,
I think they're missing a couple positive
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not my paper, but you can see
the general trend, and so it makes me a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit frustrated when you see a study
that we've used the subtherapeutic dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the worst thing in research for me
is when you don't answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: A failed study, at least you know,
when it's convoluted and you have no
[SPEAKER_00]: answers, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then if you look at this bottom
corner, when they correlate to plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, again, not many studies,
but you can see plasma level versus
[SPEAKER_00]: success looks much better here than the
low dose studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, maybe under dosing CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is one of my favorite
sections to talk about, and nobody really
[SPEAKER_00]: likes statistics, or statistics as many
people say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in research, I see just continually,
especially in cannabis, I see these
[SPEAKER_00]: things, it's like statistically improved
something, and you look at the p-value and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, oh my gosh, p-value less than
.5, this must be real, and it is real,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt, I mean, you can question some of
the data, but if you're getting positive
[SPEAKER_00]: p-values, that's a positive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, as most of us know,
this indicates whether the observed effect
[SPEAKER_00]: was just by chance, and we test it with
ANOVA's or t-test, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the threshold's about .05,
for those of you who don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically means if we ran this study
100 times, then we would expect this
[SPEAKER_00]: effect 95 times, which is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The odds are in your favor that this is a
real effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't convey practical
significance or the magnitude of effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is something we often miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the contrary, effect size means how big
is the observed effect, which is great,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could be statistically significant
or not, based on the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives real-world insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Dustin, if he sees a paper and
he's seeing a 50% improvement in
[SPEAKER_00]: something, and statistically significant,
he's probably going to feel a lot better
[SPEAKER_00]: about that paper than if he sees a 5%
improvement with statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say clinical meaning of seeing this
magnitude, very important for clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: practice, certainly important for
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, you can have something
that works that doesn't have a big
[SPEAKER_00]: magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have something that has a big
magnitude that's not statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant, so we still don't know if
it's by chance or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one way they work together to
interpret studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, next I'm going to talk about a study
that I was excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys know me, I love minor
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of rational polypharmacy
or super additive effects or potential
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage or entourage so when this came
out, I was like, oh great, what happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBN and CBD or CBN alone?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens in sleep?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's double-blind randomized
placebo-controlled study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at a 20-milligram gumming of
CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the binding says it's like 1 20th
the potency of THC, but that's a side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see these numbers, and this is kind
of verbatim from the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not hit on primary endpoint,
but they said significant improvements in
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing awakenings.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.05, significant improvements in sleep
disturbance, 0.02.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go and I look, and they have these
graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the CBN group alone, and these are
the combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this has moved over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the scale, difference from
placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I come up here, and it looks like,
it's about a half, but clearly over this
[SPEAKER_00]: line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look down at the next one,
and I come over here, and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, good, about another one difference
from placebo, the scale from four and two,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, okay, well, that's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not familiar with these scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me look into the scales a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, what you see, is the first
scale was awakenings, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So number of awakenings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a reduction of 0.5 awakenings a
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every other night you wake up one less
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a lot of awakenings, to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I looked at the scale they used
for sleep disturbance, and their baseline
[SPEAKER_00]: was 15.1, and I think we landed at about
14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a 20-point scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a one-point reduction in a
20-point scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistically significant, but like I
don't think that we can say that
[SPEAKER_00]: 20-milligram gumming is now like the best
new sleep aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just, it's not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect if you would have done this with
Delta-9-THC, we would have a much better,
[SPEAKER_00]: much more interesting result than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if we went higher with CBN,
we would have a much better result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we have in this study?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Format, I don't know if 20 milligrams of
CBN has gotten into these patients or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea, because I know if you put
it in syrup and you eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Ryan Vandrie did that study with
CBD and jam, and like it was non-detecting
[SPEAKER_00]: the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a SEDS gummy, or is this just like
a gummy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indication, it was self-reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was self-reported poor sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have sleep apnea, restless leg
syndrome, or are you just having trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, like I don't know this piece
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, does it have both
statistical significance and a meaningful
[SPEAKER_00]: effect size?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted something really new and exciting
with a minor cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBN is available, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a degradation product of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just old THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could easily research this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we're looking at CBT,
which is really hard to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, we could get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But based on this, it doesn't look
exceedingly positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some rigorously
designed studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of them are positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first one that's related to
kidney stone pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a 20-milligram CBD
intervention, which just makes me sad
[SPEAKER_00]: because they had funding for 90 patients
to do a 90-patient randomized controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: study, and they used 20 milligrams of CBD
for pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was designed well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the dosing wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, we saw nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The placebo looked slightly better in all
these outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me sad because, you know,
we could have used something else or
[SPEAKER_00]: something more than 20-milligram CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But well-designed study just didn't get a
cannabinoid person in there to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we should talk about dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an alcohol use disorder study
with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used a dose that I would think would
be in the range to see efficacy if it
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600-milligram CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty robust study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not show, they did not give the
stats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got this from clinicaltrials.gov.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not been published.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they gave the outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just based on looking at the outcomes
and drink reduction and heavy drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: days and patients without heavy drinking,
we're really not seeing any anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a little bit with the PCL5 score at
the end, which isn't related to drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's related to PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, no big hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on this study, I wouldn't suggest
that CBD is going to stop people with PTSD
[SPEAKER_00]: from drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look particularly positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, well-designed studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we answered the question,
or at least to some degree answered the
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had there been THC present or CBG present?
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a very different outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBD alone, not looking good for
alcohol use disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we've got recently terminated
studies that were well-designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one was the RELEASE study,
the MS study, spasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were counting spasms, which actually
counting spasms is quite hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not like seizures,
or most seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the primary analysis did not show
positive, was not positive in counting
[SPEAKER_00]: spasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So JAZZ pulled the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we went to this myoclonic atonic
seizure study, which looked to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a big focus on cognition
improvement and behavior in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was also just pulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two big JAZZ studies that were
robustly designed as phase three will not
[SPEAKER_00]: have data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the Prader-Willi syndrome
study, RADIUS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was pulled due to change in
corporate priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this study was voluntary terminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, another study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have looked forward to answer
some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all kind of sad,
[SPEAKER_00]: and disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that there are other studies
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw new studies listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there is an influx coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the trough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some more stuff coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that I wanted to talk about,
which was interesting, just kind of came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of left field that is positive,
was a study on dental pain, acute dental
[SPEAKER_00]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done anything in dentistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought to look in dental pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at Epidiolex 10 mpK and 20
mpK versus placebo, 20 patients in each
[SPEAKER_00]: group, enough to see signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, there's like the somewhat
passive-aggressive comment at the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said GW had no participation in the
design or conduction of this trial,
[SPEAKER_00]: nor did it provide any funding or material
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads me to believe they might
have submitted a request that got rejected
[SPEAKER_00]: and just did it on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endpoints, pain, pain relief, bite force,
and then looking at like psychosis or
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive effects and mood changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the non-normalized placebo,
but you can see a pretty significant drop
[SPEAKER_00]: in dental pain between these two groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is placebo, 10 and 20 mpKs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they normalize, you can see it's
pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say not only is this
statistically significant, but there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice magnitude of effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't just like a 10.10% reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty big reduction, not from
baseline, but from placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty happy with these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also looked at bite force,
which is much more of an objective
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tough to see here in this graph
because you do get variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go over here, you clearly see
that this 20 mpKs is separating from here
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of bite force.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do you have self-reported
pain, but you actually have the mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: act of saying, hey, does this hurt when
you bite?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go to a much higher level
because it's not painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe dentistry, maybe there needs to be
more work in the dentistry segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also need to talk about some of the
adverse events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really see any psychoactive
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that, they mean intoxicating,
no mood changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saw some sedation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we've seen that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually more in the 10 mpKs than the 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know what to make of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diarrhea, that's been reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with abdominal pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to be clear, it's not the oil that
gives the diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something going on with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this is transient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least in epilepsy, a lot of the
patients were like, well, these AEDs make
[SPEAKER_00]: me constipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great that I'm getting more
regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So side effect could be benefit in some
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last study I'm going to mention is an
older study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nervous study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a topical CBD study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit older, and you may be
wondering why I'm going to present this
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I think that exposure, they never
provided their PK for this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think exposure to CBD is fairly low
unless they took a shower in the
[SPEAKER_00]: synurbotopical.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first group, you didn't really see
much combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: No p-values.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at this, this 90%
methylated group, you do start seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: positive p-values.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is social avoidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you that don't know
Fragile X, it's kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental encephalopathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often have seizures, but also
autistic-like behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a win, but it only happened in
this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, older study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of Brian Thomas's
brainchild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know Brian Thomas, he's a legend
in the field, and you usually have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a whiteboard out when we have
conversations because it's a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: digest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things make connections that you don't
expect to make connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we move on, again, you see in this
group, you can see these trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, statistical significance and
social avoidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is a very low-exposure
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have loved to have seen what
happened with 10 or 20 mpKg CBD or with a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination product that had a little bit
of THC in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, looking positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we seeing this fully methylated
group?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could say maybe they're more,
the effect, they're affected to a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: degree than the other group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's one answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing it could be is FMR1
leads to the loss of FMRp and
[SPEAKER_00]: overexpression of daglipase in 2-AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that happens, so some people may
say that's good, but actually what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: is you tend to desensitize CB1,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that happens, it's a loss of
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've, by increasing these endocases,
endocannabinoids constantly, you've
[SPEAKER_00]: desensitized these CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: By adding CBD, Robert Loprary and Kim
Mackey have done a lot of work on negative
[SPEAKER_00]: allosteric modulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be less as more because what seems
to be happening is that seems to interfere
[SPEAKER_00]: with beta-Reston-induced internalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you may decrease the binding of
THC or the endocannabinoids, it may
[SPEAKER_00]: actually increase overall CB1 expression
leading to more receptor sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So less may be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the strong agonists like
Spice and K2, not good drugs, actually
[SPEAKER_00]: quite toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may actually want a weaker binding
agonist, and we may want to retain this
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1 tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I bring this up because this may
be, as Ethan has spoke about and we heard
[SPEAKER_00]: with endometriosis, we actually may want a
weaker agonist than a stronger agonist to
[SPEAKER_00]: target this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am almost done, so I will briefly
talk about, we've got study just started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's innovative study that's
clearly biased because it's my study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is mechanisms with high CBD
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a botanical drug substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in complex regional pain syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, complex regional pain
syndrome looks terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to tell you all the details,
but usually it happens after a fracture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing touches this condition other than
maybe nerve blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got autoimmune component,
bone component.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of problems, not a lot of
things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really sensitive to
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing, which I never really
got to do before, is we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, but we're looking at pain under fMRI
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BOLD looks at the oxygen level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see healthy individuals versus
chronic pain, you see a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: difference, so a very objective outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have placebo groups, so we'll see
what the changes look like with and
[SPEAKER_00]: without medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also doing the standard treatment
for eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at things like the
standard VAS scales, a brief pain index.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got depression, anxiety trait,
sleep, PROMIS-29, some trauma coca-cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a bunch of biomarkers related to
pain and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very excited, hope to present the data
for these today, but I don't have it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got four more of these coming
where we've got approved INDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'll leave us with today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time for questions,
but if you guys like to chat afterwards,
[SPEAKER_00]: please let me know.
