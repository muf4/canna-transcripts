[SPEAKER_02]: This episode, we are talking all about
heavy metal testing with Robert Thomas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert is the principal of Scientific
Solutions, a consulting company that
[SPEAKER_02]: serves the training, application,
marketing, and writing needs of the trace
[SPEAKER_02]: element user community.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has worked in the field of atomic and
mass spectrometry for more than 45 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: including 25 years for a manufacturer of
atomic spectroscopic instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In recent years, Rob has become a prolific
writer on the topic with more than 100
[SPEAKER_02]: technical publications to his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, he literally wrote the book on
ICP-MS, the technology labs used to detect
[SPEAKER_02]: trace elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in his latest book titled Measuring
Heavy Metal Contaminants in Cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp, he applies his knowledge to the
nascent cannabis and hemp testing space.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our conversation, we discuss what
brought Rob to the cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, how heavy metal testing in the
cannabis and hemp industry differs from
[SPEAKER_02]: the pharmaceutical industry, why cannabis
and hemp are particularly susceptible to
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy metal contamination, the multiple
sources of contamination throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation and processing process,
steps growers and producers can take to
[SPEAKER_02]: limit heavy metal contamination,
and the current and future regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: requirements for heavy metal testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation with Rob,
I'd like to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_02]: Pigment Tracker.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pigment Tracker is a fluorescence
spectrophotometer designed to allow
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis processors and operators a way to
quickly, accurately, and cheaply record
[SPEAKER_02]: the pigments in an extract or flower
sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Record keeping allows for more repeatable
processing, which lowers the likelihood
[SPEAKER_02]: that batches will be rejected by clients
or final consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: For more information, check out Pigment
Tracker's Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've provided a link in the show
description.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Robert Thomas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad I could make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have decades of experience with
heavy metal testing that you are now
[SPEAKER_02]: applying or you're lending your expertise
to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe a great place to start would be,
tell us a bit about your background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what attracted you or got you started
in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to put it all into context,
I think it's good to understand that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not from this industry, but I found the
industry about three years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: having worked 25 years for the Perkin
Elmer Corporation as an analytical chemist
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field of atomic and mass
spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took one of the retirement packages a
few years ago, and I ventured into the
[SPEAKER_00]: field of science writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always liked to write.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was reasonably good at doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started looking around for
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, I had made a lot of good
editorial contacts and I started getting
[SPEAKER_00]: requests to write about trace element
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the one thing that put me on the
map with regard to trace element analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: publications was I did a 15 part series on
ICPMS for the journal Spectroscopy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gave me a lot of visibility and a lot
of exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It eventually led to a textbook on ICPMS
in the mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, I was getting
visibility in a global sense because my
[SPEAKER_00]: book was sold all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was English, of course, but I was
fortunate enough to get it translated into
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandarin and into Spanish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gave me additional visibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, I was asked to serve on the
American Chemical Society Committee for
[SPEAKER_00]: Reagent Chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asked to lead the heavy metals task
force.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came on on board around about that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fortunate enough to be involved
with helping United States Pharmacopeia
[SPEAKER_00]: update their heavy metal testing
procedure, which eventually came out in
[SPEAKER_00]: chapters 232 and 233.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ACS was an interested stakeholder with
the USP and we had both used a heavy metal
[SPEAKER_00]: test for almost 100 years, which was a
calorimetric sulfide precipitation test,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was very crude and did not work
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was impacted by the experience of
the analyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was totally inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only for a small group of
metals, lead in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So USP were were involved with changing
that method because the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry for so many years did not have an
accurate test to actually quantify
[SPEAKER_00]: elemental impurities in pharmaceutical
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the FDA behind them, USP were
tasked with coming out with brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma spectrochemistry test methods to
come out with an accurate and precise test
[SPEAKER_00]: for replacing that sulfide precipitation
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the ACS, we were also doing that
because our book of companion standards is
[SPEAKER_00]: a book that's recommended by USP in their
USP NFL book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that if we were going to
change our method and USP were changing
[SPEAKER_00]: their method, it would be good to align
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, I was on many meetings with
the USP, which discussed how would we
[SPEAKER_00]: change the method, what was important and
how we would go about the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: changing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: USP worked very slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: ACS did this to a certain extent,
but we managed to change our methodology
[SPEAKER_00]: from the sulfide precipitation test to
ICP-OES and ICP-MS in a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet USP took in excess of 15 years to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was frustrating, but we understood that
at that time because they were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: align the method with Europe and the rest
of the world, and particularly to align it
[SPEAKER_00]: with ICH Q3D directives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in January 2018, they came out with a
standardized method for both ICP-OES and
[SPEAKER_00]: ICP-MS together with elemental impurities
for 24 heavy metals based on the method of
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they came out in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had worked with them over a number of
years up to that point being the heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals leader of the task force at the
ACS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw an opportunity to really leverage
that information which I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was still going ahead with my
writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just felt that based on that,
I presented to my publisher an opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: for another book, which was elemental
impurities in pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know textbook publishers,
it takes a whole lot of proposals and
[SPEAKER_00]: justifications to get something approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took a while, but eventually they
agreed for me to go ahead and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave them an outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took me, I used a lot of the material that
I put together for my ICP-MS book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't take as long to actually put
together a book on elemental impurities in
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me another 12 months, but it
helped having done a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in March of 2018, to coincide with the
approval of USP chapters 232 and 233,
[SPEAKER_00]: I came out with my book, which was great
for me because it put me on the map in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that again, gave me a lot of
opportunities and a lot of more writing
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at that time, I got to know the
USP folks very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suggested that I should take a look
at the cannabis industry because they felt
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were in need of help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did not have a good understanding
of heavy metal contaminants in the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing process from cultivation to
processing, to extraction, to production,
[SPEAKER_00]: to packaging, to delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a little hesitant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished a book and as a writer of
books, it consumes you for the time you're
[SPEAKER_00]: writing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't have time to do anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just finished my Pharma book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was hesitant to really get involved,
but I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started talking to some contact names
they gave me and I started realizing,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, this is an industry this exciting,
it's fractured, it's chaotic, but what an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an opportunity to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, I've got to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to my publisher again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I would like you to consider
another book.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, I had no outline for a book,
but I just felt that the industry was
[SPEAKER_00]: primed for putting together an educational
resource to help the industry understand
[SPEAKER_00]: this topic of heavy metal contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I had to write another proposal
and justification, they agreed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me another year to put it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I use components from my Pharma
book and components from my ICPMS book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just layered in a cannabis piece of
the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that very interesting because
I got a lot of input from the folks I just
[SPEAKER_00]: met in the cannabis industry or folks that
I'd connected with because that first
[SPEAKER_00]: year, I was just learning how the industry
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I did was to talk their
jargon, to fully understand how it was
[SPEAKER_00]: working and how the dynamics between
cultivators and processes and regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the things that go with the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I did, I sat down and I wrote a
proposal, wrote an outline and eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: came out with a book, Heavy Metal
Contaminants in Cannabis and Hem in
[SPEAKER_00]: December, 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was over a year ago, but that kind
of got me the visibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden I was getting so
many requests for writing, publishing and
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking engagements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that started my journey, which I'm
still on the train.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still can't get off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to, the demand for my
time is pretty crazy, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I relish that I welcome it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got a request to speak at
CanMed, I said, I've got to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I had to find funding for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me two days to get funding for my
travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm all signed up to talk at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and with that, you got involved and
that put me in contact with you and this
[SPEAKER_00]: is where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're happy to have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, analytical testing or safety
testing, it's one of our key focus areas
[SPEAKER_02]: for CanMed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to have someone like you, to give us
information or share your knowledge around
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy metal testing, it's invaluable for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to ask you, so once you
shifted from, you know, pharmaceuticals to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in terms of heavy metal testing,
what were some of the differences that you
[SPEAKER_02]: found, whether it's, you know,
in what heavy metals they're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for or techniques that they're
using or just sophistication of equipment?
[SPEAKER_02]: What were some of the things that you
noticed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the first thing I noticed
was that the pharmaceutical industry took
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 plus years to come out with
comprehensive elemental impurities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to go the whole process of
carrying out a comprehensive risk
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment study of the industry based on
the toxicity of the metals that are likely
[SPEAKER_00]: to be found somewhere in the manufacturing
process and doing a complete understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of where those elemental impurities might
occur and at what levels and documenting
[SPEAKER_00]: them in something that the pharmaceutical
industry could read and understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is fully documented in ICH Q3D
directives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes through exactly how the
pharmaceutical industry approached this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came into the cannabis industry,
I started asking people, have you done a
[SPEAKER_00]: risk assessment of heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_00]: In your products?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this blank stare or blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, what is a risk assessment
study?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, I had to come to grips
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly, the cannabis industry were
not flying by the seat of their pants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they did not have a good understanding
from cultivation to extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everything, everything involved,
there are so many contact points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I began to uncover those as I started,
as I started getting information,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I started doing research, of my own,
but sometimes I was getting evasive
[SPEAKER_00]: answers from many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about the cannabis industry,
some folks are not eager to share with
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who was just coming in trying to
understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I got some responses,
but I did a lot of research on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found out there was no understanding
of risk assessment with regard to heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was something that I felt strongly
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I realized was when
I was kind of on my own, I was a someone
[SPEAKER_00]: coming into the industry with a lot of
experience and knowledge and trace element
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, no, no one really knew me in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, how can I get credibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what so actually, so what I did was I
started working with organizations where
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd work with not so much in the past,
but organizations I knew would have an
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on the cannabis industry,
like AOAC, AST, NIST.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started and I'd had good contacts at
these organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to them and volunteered my time,
obviously, and ASTM were eager to bring me
[SPEAKER_00]: in because they didn't really have any
heavy metal expertise within the
[SPEAKER_00]: committees or subcommittees, people who
were knowledgeable, but no one,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like, with as much expertise as I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was nice that they welcomed me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things I recommended was
I wanted to get together a workshop or a
[SPEAKER_00]: symposia, which highlighted this,
which brought this out into the public
[SPEAKER_00]: domain, because to me, it wasn't in the
public domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in cannabis cultivators,
processors, regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little component of this,
you know, lots of people had, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't out there in the public domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked them if they would support me
in a heavy metal workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was this is a year ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to write a proposal, but I was used
to writing proposals and justifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we eventually put together a workshop
last summer, three day workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the chair, but supported by ASTM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got abstract, we got something like
22 abstracts in and 22 papers in just
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically on heavy metals and whole
aspects of heavy metals from instrument
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors, from cultivators, from,
I mean, from the whole industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: from academia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really brought it to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like, I think that's where the
industry started, started saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, so we need to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things started moving very slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the major difference between
working in pharma and working in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: With pharma, you had a highly regulated
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in cannabis, you have a highly
unregulated industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can call the states regulators,
they are but there's only so much they can
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have the knowledge and
expertise to really regulate the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: in a meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and I think that's a that's a symptom
of the industry in general, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a lot of us regulators,
cultivators, everyone was sort of asked to
[SPEAKER_02]: run directly after legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, industries like the
pharmaceutical industry have had decades
[SPEAKER_02]: of experience and well regulated processes
and everything that they've built upon,
[SPEAKER_02]: where we are just sort of making not
making up it as we go, we're doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: best that we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's certainly more work to be done
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to take a step back a bit and
just talk about heavy metals in general,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what elements are we talking about
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is their potential damage or effects
that they could have on humans consuming
[SPEAKER_02]: them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why in particular are cannabis and
hemp sort of susceptible to contamination?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know the cannabis and hemp are
really excellent photoaccumulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will they will accumulate any metal
any OK, not so much heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: but any elements that are in the soil or
in the growing medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will attract it and absorb it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does not affect their health and it
does not affect their rate of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for decades, they've been used as
phytoremediators to clean up toxic waste
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Chernobyl being one example of
cleaning up heavy metals, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: radionuclides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's done a really good job of doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other other plans for doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole science of phytoremediation is
is is a fascinating topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many plants that can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fortunately or unfortunately,
cannabis and hemp are one of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: phytoremediators, so they are used for
that purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the downside, a plant is used for
cannabinoids and other, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the the production of other things that we
consume really means that you have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: careful where you plant cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in the early days, the majority of
the plants were grown indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether hydroponically or in greenhouses
indoors, where the growing conditions are
[SPEAKER_00]: far more far more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's an environment which can be
controlled so you don't have the impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the impact of soil or you
don't have the impact of any contaminants
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be in an external growing
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first point to emphasize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's in the growing medium,
it will be absorbed into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get absorbed through the roots and
stay in the leaves, the shoots,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves and eventually end up in the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of studies out there
which show the ratio of how it's deposited
[SPEAKER_00]: in these different components of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in itself is a is a fascinating,
you know, fascinating way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is that some of the most
toxic heavy metals which we have which we
[SPEAKER_00]: have as humans caused anthropogenically,
we have contaminated much of the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: much of the contamination that we have
given to our soil is based on using metals
[SPEAKER_00]: like lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic,
which if you like the repercussions of an
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial world where we continually
putting heavy metal contaminants out into
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment, whether it's from lead
pipes, from water supplies, whether it is
[SPEAKER_00]: leaded gasoline, whether it's from lead in
paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lead in particular, but mercury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mercury is another element that we've done
very well or contaminated the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, power plants spew out 100 tons
of mercury every year and it goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into the soil and into the aquatic
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, once it gets in the
aquatic systems, it gets converted to
[SPEAKER_00]: methylmercury by the bottom feeders and
then it goes up the food chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you've got to be careful
when you eat fish like tuna or swordfish,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are predator fish, which will
consume all the smaller fish and it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: up the food chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result of that, the big four lead,
cadmium, arsenic and mercury are by far
[SPEAKER_00]: the most toxic and by far the most of
environmental concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not only those that are what are
called heavy metals, although heavy metals
[SPEAKER_00]: is not a group in the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people say heavy metals,
I ask them what they mean because it could
[SPEAKER_00]: mean different elements to different
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, classically, the big four
lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury,
[SPEAKER_00]: but elements like chromium, manganese,
copper, nickel, iron, zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are so many which can be
quote unquote heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're in the soil, they will end up
in the plant and ultimately they will end
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they end up in the flower or
anywhere in the biomass and that biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: you extract the cannabinoid, whatever the
cannabinoid is, it will end up to some
[SPEAKER_00]: degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you process that through the
system, depending on what process is used,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get concentration, you get
purification and you get additional
[SPEAKER_00]: elements brought into the equation because
it will absorb whatever it's in contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, metal wise, stainless
steel, brass, anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure we get into this,
but there's the whole thing about vaping
[SPEAKER_00]: devices, which has nothing to do with the
production of cannabinoids, but it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: way they're delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, we have what are called
vaping devices, which unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are little devices which contain lots
of metal components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you vape with elevated
temperatures, never mind if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing in the CBD extract or whatever the
liquid is, you have the high potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: actually corroding the internal metal
components and producing nanoparticles of
[SPEAKER_00]: that metal, which the consumer or the
vapor will take into their lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a totally different subject,
but you know, it has to be brought into
[SPEAKER_00]: the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is that it's very difficult
to eliminate any kind of metal from a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that you grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you deal with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you mitigate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you mitigate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't mitigate it, how do you
reduce the impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, if I understand correctly,
is this less of a concern with other crops
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're not as efficient as
cannabis and hemp are in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulating these metals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's a fact of life that
hemp and cannabis are really good
[SPEAKER_00]: phyto-remedies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really good at hyper accumulating
what's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other plants which will absorb
heavy metals and some of those plants we
[SPEAKER_00]: consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a number of reports out and
I've reported on them and I can certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: send you the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But arsenic in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arsenic is a big problem with rice because
it's predominantly grown in flooded
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, arsenic is a big
component in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of arsenic in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if rice is being grown in flooded
fields, the arsenic gets into the water
[SPEAKER_00]: and it gets extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets absorbed by the rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a study put out recently on
arsenic in infant cereal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, infant cereal contains a
lot of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, Congress got hold of this
report and they went to the FDA and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not acceptable because the FDA
does not do a good job of regulating food
[SPEAKER_00]: in general for heavy metals, yet alone
infant cereal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there was a report recently of
high levels of cadmium in chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets into cocoa beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it isn't only cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: As humans, we have contaminated the
environment and we have contaminated on a
[SPEAKER_00]: global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read a report recently that up to one
third of arable land in the world is
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated to some degree with heavy
metals or some kind of metal contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty scary when you consider if
that translates to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one field in three is contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the industry is not doing a good job
of understanding and dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the area that I'm trying to
bring exposure, visibility in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, that it's serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're okay at the moment because the
industry is moving so fast, so rapid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's growing so quickly with very
little serious regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point in time, the federal
government are going to have oversight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on what's going on in the
pharmaceutical industry, I think there
[SPEAKER_00]: could be some serious decisions to be
made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you briefly touched on maybe some
ways to kind of prevent getting heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metal into your cannabis, whether it's
making sure that the soil is free of heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metals or that if you're using
hydroponics, making sure that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: good water source.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm curious if you know that you have
cannabis material that is contaminated
[SPEAKER_02]: with heavy metals, is there any
opportunity for remediation or removing
[SPEAKER_02]: them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it something that you can extract
out?
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it can be extracted out,
but it's extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to someone fairly recently about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who had just grown a large batch
of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I can't remember where it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was in Colorado, but I can't
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they contacted me and asked me what
are the opportunities to mitigate or
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the heavy metal level in this
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are ways of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, extraction, for example,
but they are extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, you know, there's a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a chance that you might have
to destroy that crop, which they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's I hear of this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though I can tell you that the
industry is concerned about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are ways that they could reduce
heavy metals by using higher purity
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, clean fertilizers, water that's
water that's been tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you if you were growing hemp in say,
an area where they know where you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they use leaded pipes and using that
supply of water, guaranteed there would be
[SPEAKER_00]: lead in the water supply and guaranteed it
would end up in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be you've got to pay
attention to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to pay attention to how you
can mitigate or reduce the level of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals in the plant, eventually the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've I actually give a talk at a
financial cannabis workshop the past
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of days, Wednesday and Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone else who gave a talk before me
was from Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave a talk actually on that
problem of how do you reduce or how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate the transfer of heavy metals from
the soil into the cannabis and hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fascinating talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope there are people listening to
that because this is where this is where
[SPEAKER_00]: we can have the biggest impact of getting
clean cannabis and hemp is that is at the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, kind of before we went on
that, you were talking about regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: and I did want to ask you about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that heavy metal testing,
it's well, first of all, regulation is is
[SPEAKER_02]: very state dependent, as we know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to your knowledge, you know,
what states are requiring heavy metal
[SPEAKER_02]: testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we know, at least on our side from
medicinal genomics, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the state to state requirements can vary
vastly, where some can be sort of overly
[SPEAKER_02]: inclusive with too many things and others
can be drastically under under inclusive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your opinion, you know, which states
are getting it right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what do you think are the most
important heavy metals that folks should
[SPEAKER_02]: be testing for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, to start with,
when when states started regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and they came up with a list of
four heavy metals, that was predominantly
[SPEAKER_00]: they look to the dietary supplements
industry and they look to the American
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal pharmacopeia who were only who were
only only had the big four heavy metals on
[SPEAKER_00]: a list of heavy metals to monitor for for
dietary supplements and herbal products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can understand where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what has happened as the industry
and different states have come on board,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have been a little more proactive in
trying to understand what other heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals could be of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of the states have increased
that panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, for example, has nine on their
list, the big four plus chromium,
[SPEAKER_00]: nickel, barium, zinc, selenium,
and I think one of the zinc.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so OK, so they have nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland had selenium, silver,
barium and chromium, but they've recently
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed back on selenium, silver and
barium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have chromium in the big four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan has the big four plus copper,
nickel, chromium and inorganic arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Michigan had an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand because no other state
has inorganic arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to find out why Michigan
decided to specify inorganic arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't to be any any apparent
reason why they do that, because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to a state testing lab and they
report total arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think that maybe state
regulators don't understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I'm not being unkind to
them, but there's no reason why they
[SPEAKER_00]: should have done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think some states have been proactive
and I've got involved with a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, who had no heavy metals limits,
put out for public comment their new
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and I sent my comments in
together with a few of my publications to
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest that you should be monitoring
maybe up to 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether they will do that,
but at least I put it out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it to them in public comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Connecticut also had, were revising
their heavy metals regulations and wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: public comment on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sent those in as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, what I tell state
regulators, because I know a lot of state
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators, they kind of understand what
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very sympathetic, but I think they
understand that they do want to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: first to expand the panel to say 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're waiting for other
states, but I keep reminding them NIST
[SPEAKER_00]: have recently come out with a toxic metal
certified reference material, which
[SPEAKER_00]: contains up to 13 elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, look, the NIST, they believe
that NIST should be regulated more like
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco than it should be, you know,
as it's been regulated at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I serve on the ASTM committee,
D37, and I'm on a number of subcommittees.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is the laboratory
subcommittee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have just written a method for up
to 21 elements in cannabis related
[SPEAKER_00]: materials by ICPMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently going through the review
process now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that will come out in the
next month or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really excited that ASTM are supporting
me on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they only have the 21 elements in that
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, which is brand new, USP have put
out the public comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They posted a draft monograph for CBD to
be used as an API.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be CBD to be used in a
pharmacy or a drug formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking about, you know,
Epidiolex or maybe other drugs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going through FDA approval, which contains
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that draft proposal, they say that
it must meet requirements of chapter 232
[SPEAKER_00]: for elemental impurities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's telling me that if they have
that CBD monograph in their book of
[SPEAKER_00]: compendial standards to make CBD that's of
the quality required for an FDA-based
[SPEAKER_00]: drug, they're going to have to be
monitoring up to 24 elemental impurities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is telling me this is the way the
industry is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to get the cannabis
industry on board to really think about
[SPEAKER_00]: this because, you know, you'd only be in a
position where when you're two years down
[SPEAKER_00]: the road, FDA comes in and says,
well, what's your list of elemental
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many are you monitoring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it obviously won't be as simple as
that, but I'm telling you, based on my
[SPEAKER_00]: research, all the signs are that the
elemental panel is going to be expanded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you mentioned all the different
elements that folks should be monitoring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious, what is like an acceptable
limit for these elements?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it differ for each elements?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are some sort of like pass fail where you
don't want a trace of anything or in
[SPEAKER_02]: others, there's sort of a limit that's
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what the states are using is the PDE
limits that are generated for drug
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, drug substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is described in ICH Q3D
directives where they spend 15 years to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand toxicity based on
well-established animal models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that information for pharmaceuticals is
documented and it's good data based on
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got to understand that
pharmaceuticals are delivered basically
[SPEAKER_00]: four different ways, orally, inhalation,
intravenously and transdermal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are four different categories of
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can imagine, an inhalation has much
lower PDE limits than say an oral
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also remember that these are limits
per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way they define them in chapter 232
and ICH Q3D directives is maximum limits
[SPEAKER_00]: per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give you an example, if a
pharmaceutical compound has a maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery, maximum amount of 10 grams per
day, you divide these daily maximum limits
[SPEAKER_00]: by 10 and you can come out with an
approximation of what you need to have in
[SPEAKER_00]: your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's great because the
pharmaceutical industry is well used to
[SPEAKER_00]: defining delivery amounts and mode of
administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you define 10 grams per day,
what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who's inhaling cannabis,
someone who's eating a brownie,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who's putting it on their on their
arthritic finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are so many ways that
cannabinoids are being delivered to
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't say for certain that someone
is only consuming X grams per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're basing your maximum
allowable limits on a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: guideline, which is based on a maximum
dosage per day, you have to define a
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum dosage in your cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that's my critique of the way
the regulations go, is that there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: logic to the way they define the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for example, many states, even though
they lump every cannabinoid or every
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis product into one mode of
delivery, they'll say that it has to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: the inhalation PDEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll work that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no rhyme or reason why that should
be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because they're the lowest,
they feel that if they can put the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, the maximum levels in their
specifications for those product,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's under those levels, the product
has to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a dumb way of regulating,
you know, cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my other critique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceutical PDEs are based on
well-established animal models.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're based on delivery methods and
they're based on maximum dosages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis regulations, they don't take any
of that into consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked a little bit about sort of
the different sources of contamination
[SPEAKER_02]: that can introduce heavy metals into
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about from just growing the
plant, whether it's accumulating it from
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil or the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to get into maybe after
post-harvest, what are some other ways
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, heavy metals could
contaminate the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know based on the extraction
process that different amounts of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metal will be extracted into whatever you
make it, broad spectrum, full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the extraction method,
whether it's CO2, whether it's alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's butane, I mean, there's so
many of them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definite and there's information
in the public domain, which talks about
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to balance efficiency of the
extraction method for producing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And extracting the minimum amount of heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most extractors will obviously look for
efficiency and not be so worried so much
[SPEAKER_00]: about are you extracting contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always point to GW Pharmaceuticals
who have their extraction patent in the
[SPEAKER_00]: public domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at that and it's complicated,
but it explains it very nicely that they
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced up the contaminants with
efficiency of CBD that ultimately they're
[SPEAKER_00]: making CBD to make drugs like Epidialox.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually have another one going
through the FDA pipeline, which is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go for okay, less efficiency,
but extracting less of the contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason they can do that is their
growing process is all indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the cannabis that GW Pharma grows to
make Epidialox is grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're controlling the environment
very, very strictly, controlling the
[SPEAKER_00]: watering, controlling the nutrient,
the fertilizer and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, many extractors in the US don't
grow it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not looking at that extraction
efficiency with regard to contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that there's probably more
heavy metal contaminants coming through
[SPEAKER_00]: the extraction process, which could
further down the processing chain could be
[SPEAKER_00]: purified, could be concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're always going to be dealing with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you take it through the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what you're making,
that's going to be in contact with things
[SPEAKER_00]: like stainless steel mixing vessels,
maybe grinding equipment or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so many different options
here of what the product could be in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know based on the searches out
there and what Ivan covered, that for
[SPEAKER_00]: example, it'll pick up chromium from a
stainless steel cutting scissors,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is used to snip the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you believe that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is me, but certainly in mixing vessels,
I mean, you know, chromium, nickel and
[SPEAKER_00]: iron are big components of stainless
steel, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you use a lot of stainless steel
somewhere in the manufacturing process,
[SPEAKER_00]: your product will pick up one or more of
those metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that... I mean,
that's got to be difficult, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, of course, us coming from the
microbial side, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, one of the advantages of stainless
steel is that it's pretty sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be harboring microbial
life as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you have something else you need
to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, I could point you to
publications which have shown that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to understand that
many times in the processing, in the chain
[SPEAKER_00]: of things you're doing in processing
the...
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whatever you're making,
it's not in contact with surfaces for long
[SPEAKER_00]: periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's stored in something,
and this is a whole science of its own,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that liquids picking up impurities from
storage vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say storage vessels,
I mean things like glass, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know, for example, that borosilicate
glass, which is used a lot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, is notorious for having high
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, not so much heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But transition metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those are heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an analytical chemist who uses glass
in the process of analyzing anything for
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals, you learn you can never use
borosilicate glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to use either high-purity
borosilicate glass or quartz glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the purest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, if you store any acids,
any calibration standards in borosilicate
[SPEAKER_00]: glass, you'll get metals that are actually
being leached out of the surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you tend to use high-purity plastics,
but not all plastics are high-purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to be careful the type of
polymer or plastic that you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an example recently where a
testing lab in Florida was finding over
[SPEAKER_00]: time that CBD in graduated little dropper
bottles was increasing in lead levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the time that the product was made
to two to three months on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was that the graduated
marks were made from lead-based ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was happening was the lead was
leaching out of the ink into the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure what the extract was,
but this testing lab was finding over an
[SPEAKER_00]: extended period of time of testing,
it went from round about the regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: level, which was half a PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, they were getting up to
50 times higher in the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's stuff like this that the
industry, do they realize?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some folks do when they do
anything about it, not many, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: so many points along the way where this
could be happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get into delivery of the
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get into the vaping devices,
which are becoming the delivery method of
[SPEAKER_00]: choice nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scary to think what is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the industry is not doing a good job
of trying to understand that because the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of knowing what's in the aerosol
is very different to knowing what's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid in the tank, because the liquid in
the tank is at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start heating it up, elevating the
temperature and then vaping it because
[SPEAKER_00]: that in itself will draw out the heavy
metals which are being corroded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vapor or the consumer will end up
vaping small little particles of those
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the regulated big four,
but we know based on a few studies out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, there's not many that are iron
particles, that are chromium particles,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are lead particles, that are nickel
particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because of the components
inside these vaping devices, including
[SPEAKER_00]: lead-based solder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think that wouldn't be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the industry is moving away from
lead-based solder because initially it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge, huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you're using, whether it's
stainless steel, brass, nichrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: cantal, there are so many different
designs out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you increase, when you start vaping
at two to 300 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you start corroding the inside of the
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's anyone's guess how many
you're getting through to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I guess given that,
and maybe not so much that last example
[SPEAKER_02]: that you provided though, but the fact
that this contamination could happen kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of throughout the supply chain here,
is it important that testing labs be
[SPEAKER_02]: testing sort of the final product for
these impurities?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know that that's also very state
dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for example, California, that is a
requirement and you have to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to talk about this to
many regulators because I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: convince the regulator community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a national association of
regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what they're called.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the state regulator, one of the state
regulators for Maryland is the chair of
[SPEAKER_00]: that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she talked at an AOAC meeting last
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the questions I asked her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I need to get the regulators to
make them understand that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that they should be looking at
seriously and being proactive in maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to increase the number of elements
in your state, because the elements that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not being measured and not being
scrutinized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know, and I've talked again to many
people about this, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators are using things like nickel
based salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce larger flours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silicon based salts, which make the chute
much sturdier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's stuff going on like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these elements are escaping the
scrutiny of state regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not being regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not picking nickel and silicon out
for any other reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that these are used by
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can argue that most of the
nutrients and fertilizers that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: used are not high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are being made from
phosphate based fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphate based fertilizers are notorious
for having high levels of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's anyone's guess what
metals are being delivered from the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient and the fertilizer into the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I, you know, again, trying to
get the attention of the industry and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, regulators are one component.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've offered to give a talk to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you familiar with this National
Association of Regulators?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I followed up with an email to the
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The talk was a lady called Laurie Dodson.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to be a... Do you know Laurie?
[SPEAKER_02]: The name does sound familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked her a question, which was a
little bit unfair because she couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really answer it that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said, I would love to talk to your
group about how maybe, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be aware of the problem, to be aware
that a lot of elements are not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: scrutinized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's impacting the safety,
you know, consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've got to be careful what I say
here because I, you know, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: alarm the industry that all of a sudden
that the industry is producing unsafe
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just trying to make them aware of
research that I've done over the past two
[SPEAKER_00]: to three years, which has covered a lot in
my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I followed up with publications and
public speaking engagements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think the industry should be more
aware of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then it's a great thing that you're
coming to CanMed this year because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: attracting folks from all over the
industry and you'll definitely have a
[SPEAKER_02]: platform to get information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's why I wanted to accept the
invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's probably a three or four
day trip for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, again, you have to justify
your time and your expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's well worth it,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I let you go, Rob, I do want to
give you a chance to share any additional
[SPEAKER_02]: resources with the audience that they can
learn more about your work or the topic in
[SPEAKER_02]: general.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you let me know, I can put the links
into the show description so that they can
[SPEAKER_02]: learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, would you mind if I give you a
link to my book, for example?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, let me give you links to a
couple of my sort of more recent
[SPEAKER_00]: publications and that will give the
audience, I think, a better understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of where we are at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I encourage any listeners to come out
to CanMed as well and listen to Rob's
[SPEAKER_02]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk to me personally then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again, Rob.
