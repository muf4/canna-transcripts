[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having stayed that
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely the better choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be just stuck in traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're stuck with me, and we are
enjoying process chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked so much about the plant
genetics, the chemo profiles of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, and then the cancer effects,
anti-cancer effects, and other medical
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm the lonely chemist, well,
one of the few chemists up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to point out it's not as
easy to just, hey, if OG Cush works,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the one that treats your
indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make this point that there is a
little bit more to the whole production
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline than just strain, and then you're
good with a medical outcome, I just want
[SPEAKER_00]: to show what all happens during these
steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, I bastardized one of the
dyskonomics graphical representations,
[SPEAKER_00]: because up here, I devised this kind of
visualization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in the middle, the middle circle
shows us which cannabinoids are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue ones are THC, the red ones are
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows the red ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio and the diameter of that circle
is how much there is, the total
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same counts for the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just point a few out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not important to really remember
which cannabinoid is which color and which
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene is which color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just important to just understand the
basics, like ratio and the diameter is
[SPEAKER_00]: your concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also not concentrate on cultivation
or formulation, because they are not my
[SPEAKER_00]: fields of expertise, and we talked about
that enough over the last few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see different strains,
different cultivars, offer different
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the cannabinoid side, not so much,
because as it was pointed out in a recent
[SPEAKER_00]: paper, there is actually not much
difference, thanks to being able to test
[SPEAKER_00]: for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cultivars in California are now high
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that was the greatest idea,
we are not really sure, but there is still
[SPEAKER_00]: a large variation in the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, you have different
dominant terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the yellow, that's limonene,
then that's mercine, and here the orange
[SPEAKER_00]: one is betacarophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also see them in different
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a difference in terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw in the talk yesterday about this
omics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a very nice paper that
talks about the chemical chemo-virus by
[SPEAKER_00]: Fischer-Dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, my focus is on what happens
between you grow it and then you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: give it to your patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to point out,
it might be obvious, but some people might
[SPEAKER_00]: forget about this too, is the way you dry
your plant actually controls how much
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have much effect on the
cannabinoids itself, but if you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: fast dry, like, hey, I dry it in four
days, and then I go on, you lose most of
[SPEAKER_00]: your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to control the conditions in
your drying room to really control what is
[SPEAKER_00]: left on the terpene side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can take that further, depending on
which atmosphere you store the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid, or the cannabis itself,
you again, you affect the concentrations,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amounts of terpenes, the
concentrations of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even the ratio of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at this here, this is blue,
yellow, gray, green, which is the same
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you change the gases, now we have
instead the gray, we have a blue in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really can't remember which terpenes
they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, we are changing the
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is good and bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, if you wanted something to be
stable, don't change your gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to be more of an artisan,
approach to really modulate the flavor or
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpene profile, you can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use all these aspects to
compensate for any variants that might
[SPEAKER_00]: come out from the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your lights were off for a day,
or you had a hail day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, probably then it's all dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it rained, for example,
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just in the drying and curing
aspect of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my main field of research has been on
the extraction side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we just pick one of the cured
strains and we take them along,
[SPEAKER_00]: pro tip, if you want to extract,
don't cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the extraction part, it even makes
a difference how you mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different milling methods will give you
different extracts if you keep everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to point out the food blender
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't just say, oh,
I mill it and then we are good compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at two millimeters, we get this
basically best yield out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do a food blender, which gives
you a very imprecise, varied particle
[SPEAKER_00]: size, it will be all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you care about efficiencies,
that's definitely not the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the extraction itself,
and here I just show that for
[SPEAKER_00]: supercritical CO2 extraction, you can
really modulate what you extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pick out just the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pick out just the neutral
cannabinoids, the THC here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I can extract a THC acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the acid form and have that one
relatively purified or enriched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't even go like, oh,
you took Sour Kush and extracted it with
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still don't know what you actually got
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't go from one vendor to the
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably don't use the same methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can play with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as an extractor myself, I can now
still use that to play and modulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does the doctor want?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the patient need?
[SPEAKER_00]: What variants did I get out of the grove?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I need to buffer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same I can actually do with CBD
versus THC extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have different solubilities in
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can now play with that ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know from all these chemovars studies
that this cannabis cultivars mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: extract exclusive express.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly THC, mostly CBD, or a one-to-one
mixture in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want a three-to-one from a
cultivar, you can do that if you play with
[SPEAKER_00]: your extraction conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the hemp people, if you need to
suppress your THC amount, there's a way
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that in the extractor and not having
to deal with it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OK, now we're done, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately not, because normally you
post-process, or most people will
[SPEAKER_00]: post-process the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the general thing that is done is
decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen it in person far too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in an extraction room, and they
have these two-liter, five-liter beakers
[SPEAKER_00]: on a hot plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just bubbling away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I ask them, so how long does that
go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, two, three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really that precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some research on process
analytics to actually track that in real
[SPEAKER_00]: time, how it decarboxylates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the big takeaways was if you do
decarboxylation under air, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen, you have heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my case, here, when you do it under
air, yeah, you get your THC
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylated, but you also get delta-8
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a plethora of stuff that
you don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are currently no analytical methods
that can tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it made the people high,
it looks clear, so we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, we don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend doing that under an
inert atmosphere, so here, exemplified by
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no oxygen present, so you don't
get all these wild side reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And talking about side reactions,
that is still possible in your
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're good in distilling, you kill
these few percentage of THCA and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: some other minor cannabinoids and get rid
of all the flavor, and you have really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, clear, pure THC, which we just saw
in the talk before, isn't maybe not the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing you should use anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't really know how to
extract and you just think clear is king,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get all these other things that are
currently still unidentified, but at least
[SPEAKER_00]: they make you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just boggles my mind as a chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what they're doing,
and most people don't seem to really care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really need to think about this
processing step also on a very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: and organized method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I'm not talking about
formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to do one case study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a patient, so all of this research
was done at Outco in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fully vertically integrated
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a patient in his mid-30s,
and he had about eight seizures a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mother was at the end of her hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else, the classical medications
didn't work, so she comes to us and wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that she really wants to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point, she said, OK,
we try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she buys this CBD-THC tincture with a 1
to 3 ratio, 40 milligrams per milliliter,
[SPEAKER_00]: no terpenes, because I do remove them
mainly for flavor aspects out of my
[SPEAKER_00]: extract first, and then MCT also,
medium chain triglycerides from coconut
[SPEAKER_00]: oil distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the patient basically went
seizure-free for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the mother comes back and buys the
next bottle when it's empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same bottle, the 3 to 1 oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seizures restart immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dispensary is freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had seen Professor Dini Mary's talk
last year at Harvard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yes, I was waiting for
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we changed chemovar because we ran
out of diamond OG, so we used lemonade
[SPEAKER_00]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we formulated it exactly to the same
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the patient seizures again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we scrapped together all the leftover
diamond OG, give that to the patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the patient is seizure-free again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm sitting there, and I was like,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have until Christmas, because then
we are out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OK, so CBD THC is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: My formulation scientist actually can do
his job and waste the materials correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the acid forms of the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are kind of the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even looked down our list of tested
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is CBN present, CBG present.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCV present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't really say there is a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at CBG and CBC, we do see a
present or absence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thanks to the talks we saw beforehand,
that might still not be the right answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where my analytics end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I right now have no access to further
analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm definitely not going to
fractionate my oils and going to try that
[SPEAKER_00]: on the one patient, if it works or
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to do that, like 20
different oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are here at this conference,
and we're all very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it might not be as easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should consider all the steps in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be hard, and that might be
boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kills the party normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now when I tell them what I do,
I own this party.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you bring samples?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves
like, yeah, cannabis cures everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cancer does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dead and don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis cures everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do it that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to have a long way ahead of
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking to a formulation
scientist recently, and she's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, we are about in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the progress that's currently there,
we have a few decades to catch up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to thank everyone I worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked or work at Outco for now,
the dispensary in San Diego that does all
[SPEAKER_00]: the work and gives me all the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these optimization studies where you
saw the few disks, that's about 10 kilos
[SPEAKER_00]: or 20 pounds of weed per disk just to get
the data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of stuff, but it makes
money back afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then the other companies we worked
with is Nate for the controls in the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Henkelman was for the gases and the
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fridge is the milling study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apex is all the extraction work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perkin-Alma was the work we did for
process analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did make it to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to point out is I'm getting
kind of frustrated with these things we
[SPEAKER_00]: currently do and don't do yet and can't
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, I wanted to mention that
earlier, you don't actually have to take
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of it because I'll upload
everything on slideshare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And otherwise, if you have any questions
or want to do any collaborations,
[SPEAKER_00]: please find me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are votes next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm German.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm heading to Canada, and I do some work
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please find me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have time for a couple of questions,
if you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to clarify, with those two
preparations, were you fortifying with
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated compounds to reach those equal 3
to 1 levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: We fortified with CBD isolate,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only grow THC strains, so we used
isolated CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you aware if the patient has had a
chance to try CBG or CBGA?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no access to that purified,
so I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't offer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Round of applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Marcus Rogan.
