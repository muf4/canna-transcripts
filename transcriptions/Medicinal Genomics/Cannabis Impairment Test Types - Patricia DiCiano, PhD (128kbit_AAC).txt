[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them being that there's a
number of different fluids that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that your paper kind of looked
at this kind of saliva versus urine versus
[SPEAKER_00]: blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is sort of the best one to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now at the roadside, what is
happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in Canada for sure, I think it's
similar in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is if an officer suspects somebody of
being impaired, they pull them over and
[SPEAKER_01]: they do a standardized field sobriety
test, which is the, you know, touching
[SPEAKER_01]: your nose and looking at the stagness and
your ability to walk in the one leg stand,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, your balance and things like
that, which we've all seen on TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we're a little bit familiar with
what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're also able to do at the
roadside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know in Canada, we use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a saliva test that measures,
it gives you a reading that says positive
[SPEAKER_01]: or negative if you're above a certain
level or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the blood, which they can
take you back to the lab and they can look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the blood levels of THC as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's urine, of course,
which is a bit of a different beast,
[SPEAKER_01]: because with urine, you're measuring the
breakdown products of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're measuring what it comes off the
cannabis, whereas with saliva and blood,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're measuring THC directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for that reason, urine probably isn't a
great indicator of recent use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, as we know, these breakdown products
of cannabis of THC can last in the urine
[SPEAKER_01]: for days, weeks, a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a great indicator of very
recent use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just says that somebody has used in the
past few days, or potentially longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the lava tells you more of a short
time window in the past 12 hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: and blood can give you a more definitive
timeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if somebody has very high levels
of blood THC, then you know they've used
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly recently, or smoked fairly
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're lower than they would have
used at some point in the past day or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's more of an accurate time window
for blood and saliva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is it fairly easy to kind of look
at the concentrations in the blood or
[SPEAKER_00]: saliva and sort of trace backwards how
much cannabis the person could have
[SPEAKER_00]: ingested?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm sorry, I'm going to keep doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep kind of doing the
comparison to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if you're at like a 0.8
alcohol level, you can kind of kind of go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and be like, okay, they've probably
had a few a few drinks, at least in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past hour or two, can you do a similar
thing with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really to estimate the last time of
use and the exact amount of use is quite
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging with cannabis because the
amount of THC in blood and urine is really
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on a lot of factors,
including age, sex, how often you use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, what form of cannabis you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that smoked and baked cannabis
produce very much higher levels very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly in blood and saliva than with
edibles, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But edibles last very a lot longer than
smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: With smoked or baked, it's gone in five
hours with edibles that can last much
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody comes up with 10 nanograms
per mil of THC, it's really hard to know
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of cannabis they used and when
they last used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, people who use frequently the
cannabis might stick around longer in the
[SPEAKER_01]: blood, urine than people who use
infrequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tell you've used recently,
but we don't know exactly how much or when
[SPEAKER_01]: that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know exactly how much or when
that was.
We don't know exactly how much or when
that was
