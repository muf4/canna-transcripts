[SPEAKER_01]: So what made you interested investigating
how cannabis can affect longevity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this actually started out with a
conversation with the FDA because you know
[SPEAKER_00]: with with the legalization of CBD or the
removal from the Controlled Substance Act
[SPEAKER_00]: the FDA had a lot of concerns with you
know What happens if you take CBD for an
[SPEAKER_00]: extended period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 years 30 years is something gonna
pop up down the road?
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be detrimental and You know,
it's obviously very difficult to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: studies of humans And it's even difficult
to do them in rodents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a You know extended period of
time, maybe three five years to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: that lifespan depending on that specific
species One of the I would say best
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-clinical whole organism models is the
C elegans model It's kind of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: canary in the coal mine model The EPA
likes this for toxicity so for example if
[SPEAKER_00]: there was potentially contaminated water
If they don't know what they're testing
[SPEAKER_00]: for it's difficult to determine You know
what the problem is and if it's really a
[SPEAKER_00]: danger So they may use C elegans and if
they die early, then you probably want to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay away from the that particular water
It's also been used in the International
[SPEAKER_00]: Space Station by NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what's the What's the the
you know, what happens when you're at
[SPEAKER_00]: space for an extended period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know what that means for
humans, but we can look another animal
[SPEAKER_00]: model So that was really the the start of
this work was hey, is this toxic and at
[SPEAKER_00]: what level would it be toxic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that you know affect?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the life of these in this
particular model Interestingly enough what
[SPEAKER_00]: we found is it wasn't really that toxic
Until you went to super physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts and still it wasn't, you know
overly toxic But then we started seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: this, you know increase in lifespan and
health span We also ran that model with
[SPEAKER_00]: can have a Gerald lesser-known cannabinoid
and we saw similar similar effects so both
[SPEAKER_00]: appeared non-toxic at physiologically
relevant amounts and Extended lifespan and
[SPEAKER_00]: activity levels during that life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know rather As it would now again,
this is a model but as it would apply to
[SPEAKER_00]: humans It would be akin to you know,
a 80 year old acting more like a 60 year
[SPEAKER_00]: old in terms of health span measures So
not only did they live longer they were
[SPEAKER_00]: more active through that late stage of
their life so the benefits of health span
[SPEAKER_01]: and lifespan it sounds like it was sort of
just a Happy coincidence like you were
[SPEAKER_01]: originally looking at the toxicity but
then observed this positive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were We wanted you know, we obviously
wanted to to find out, you know how safe
[SPEAKER_00]: the compounds were were but obviously when
you when you find out that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially larger more profound benefit
then that's Then that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly important and relevant For us
within the cannabinoid industry You You
