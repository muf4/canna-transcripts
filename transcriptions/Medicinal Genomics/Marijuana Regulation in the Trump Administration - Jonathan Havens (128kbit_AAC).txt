[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from the East Coast or I'm an
attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wearing a tie, which I know might be
forbidden with this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I wasn't wearing a tie,
maybe you wouldn't take me as seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be talking this morning
about cannabis regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know most people in this room want to
talk about breakthroughs and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what the potentials of this wonder plant
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not here to rain on that parade,
but my job and what I do with my clients
[SPEAKER_00]: is I look at what are the regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get licenses to grow,
process and dispense cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you transport investigational drugs
across state lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is still federally illegal
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so talking about regulation is
necessary, unfortunately, but hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: with my background and the things that
I've looked at, I can come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: creative solutions and interesting ways to
look at these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you all have copies or will have a copy
of my slide deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to leave time for questions,
so I'm going to go through this pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's very common at conferences for
people to take pictures of slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problem if you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you email me, I'm happy to email you a
copy of my deck directly so you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to take pictures, but it's completely up
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look, I think most people in this room
understand what the regulatory status of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is, but let's just briefly talk
about it for the time being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just briefly talk about it for
the time being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go figure the prospects of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's absolutely no possibility for
confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So states are establishing these programs
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before you think that it's just what
you consider to be liberal states,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma just passed a referendum and has
a lot of people who are interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: getting these licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah, it's on their ballot for this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a red state, blue state issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those who think about this as a
Republican, Democrat, old, young,
[SPEAKER_00]: male, female, male issue do so at their
own peril.
[SPEAKER_00]: The demographics cut across every
different line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't just get lazy and think that you
can assume that a state doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: program, because the fact is the majority
of states do have programs, and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: after the upcoming election there will be
more to that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first wrote this slide,
it says President Trump on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't trying to be cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about President Trump's
positions on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think I was trying to be funny,
then I guess I'll take credit for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually don't know very much about
what the president's positions are on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He obviously said, or not so obviously,
but as some of you might know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said on the campaign trail,
that's a state's rights issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to interfere.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did issue this signing statement with
the omnibus bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's these omnibus bills,
because Congress, unlike when I worked on
[SPEAKER_00]: Capitol Hill years and years ago,
getting standalone spending bills done are
commonplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely impossible now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do these mega omnibus,
sometimes called Christmas tree bills,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a bunch of things get stuffed under
the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in any event, he issued this signing
statement and essentially said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reserving my right to do what I want
to enforce federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very helpful to give us your position on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tom Angel, who has this daily
newsletter that if you're not reading it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pretty worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it every morning among many other
publications, said, my read is that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically reserving the right to do
whatever he wants, which is what I just
[SPEAKER_00]: said.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I go overboard in putting
links and sources in my presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for a few reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, because I'm a nervous lawyer,
it's some CYA, but also, and more
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, it's so you can all see what
I'm reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is I'm reading a lot of
things, and to keep up with developments
[SPEAKER_00]: in this space, you need to read a lot of
different sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of people report things
incorrectly, and so checking two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: or four different sources is probably a
good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, President Trump said on the
campaign trail, I'm going to leave it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, after Jeff Sessions rescinded
what's known as the Cole Memorandum,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll get back to what that is,
Cory Gardner, Senator from Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: said, all right, you're going to encroach
on states' rights in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put a hold on every
Department of Justice nominee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked for a while, and then Cory
Gardner made, I think what Trump would
[SPEAKER_00]: say, if he's talking about it,
was a bad deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cory Gardner basically pulled his holds on
these nominations for Trump's support of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bill that didn't yet exist on his desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was, I thought Cory Gardner
had a pretty good point on holding the DOJ
[SPEAKER_00]: nominees.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was pretty bold on it, but he gave up a
little too early, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some pieces of legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this Warren Gardner piece of
legislation, the States Act, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: make more permanent what Rohrabacher
Blumenauer does, that amendment that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to about these major spending
bills that basically says, if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance with your state laws,
the feds usually won't go after you,
[SPEAKER_00]: although there's a number of exceptions to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the interest of time, I'm shortchanging
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assure you there are many more details,
a lot of this, but I'm not going to bore
[SPEAKER_00]: you with those right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked about the Cole Memorandum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a very, very important piece of
guidance from the Obama administration
[SPEAKER_00]: that essentially said, if you're in
compliance with your state's programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: your state medical marijuana programs,
the feds will not go after you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are enforcement priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cross state lines, if you divert to
youth, a number of different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we reserve the right to go after you
because, of course, this is all federally
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be splitting hairs, but you'll
hear people say, you know, California
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, California authorized people to grow,
process, and dispense recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still federally illegal, and the feds
could technically still come in and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that that's pretty unlikely as
long as you're not violating one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a major shift in drug policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helped the proliferation of the state
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on January 4th, Jeff Sessions
woke up and said, I don't like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm going to rescind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a very perverse way, I'm somewhat
thankful that he did, and I'll tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has never motivated more action on
Capitol Hill and made members of Congress
[SPEAKER_00]: put their money where their mouth is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proliferation of cannabis-friendly
legislation on Capitol Hill, although most
[SPEAKER_00]: of it ultimately unsuccessful or getting
stuck in committee, has flourished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Jeff Sessions, this is like a
strict constructionist view of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's essentially saying this isn't law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress, if you want this to be law,
you need to make it law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he rescinded the coal memo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The impact on the industry has not been
that quantifiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the industry has continued to
flourish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some CEOs of these cannabis
companies are a little bit more worried at
[SPEAKER_00]: night, but generally speaking,
enforcement has not been much greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you'll hear a lot in the
headlines about, oh, the coal memo was
[SPEAKER_00]: rescinded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeff Sessions actually rescinded
several policies on January 4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to know what all these
policies are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important to understand how
these policies interplay with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, FinCEN, which is the
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Department of the Treasury,
who has the cannabis banking memorandum,
[SPEAKER_00]: that banking memorandum, which allows some
banks or gives some banks some comfort to
[SPEAKER_00]: bank cannabis, that memo is based on the
coal memo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are afraid,
well, now that the coal memo has been
[SPEAKER_00]: rescinded, what's going to happen to the
FinCEN memo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Secretary Mnuchin from the Treasury
Department has said it's on Treasury's
[SPEAKER_00]: list of things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have said that they're going to
rescind their memo altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not clear, but again, it's important to
understand the interplay between these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that regulations are not what a
lot of you want to think about or even
[SPEAKER_00]: think about this early in the day,
but you realize how important a role these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations play, and that's what I do on
a day-to-day basis as I look at these
[SPEAKER_00]: things and figure out how they actually
impact the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to get into that slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was Sessions' move to rescind the coal
memo surprising?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read any of his quotes,
he's obviously not a fan of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can read all these quotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more entertaining than anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're super helpful,
but it goes to show you what DOJ's
[SPEAKER_00]: positions are on cannabis, or at least the
head of the DOJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, though, Jeff
Sessions said there should be more
[SPEAKER_00]: competition for growers who are growing
for research purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you look at Jeff Sessions,
the lazy part of it is, the lazy approach
[SPEAKER_00]: is he's anti-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put policies in front of this
administration that are tenable from some
[SPEAKER_00]: of their strict constructionist,
small government view, I think some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these have a likelihood of passing and
getting through, but again, it's Congress
[SPEAKER_00]: that needs to make the first move on a lot
of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean when Jeff Sessions
rescinds the coal memo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what it means is that U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys around the country have a lot
more discretion, and so you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention to what U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys in your respective jurisdictions
are saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some reports here from Colorado and
California and Massachusetts, because
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously those are robust areas in this
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Public opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: My time is winding down, and I,
again, want to leave time for questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, if you assume that this is a
young, a pro-millennial issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you assume this is a pro-Democrat
issue, you're wrong, and you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: that mistake at your own peril.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a lot of entrepreneurial politicians
have realized, marijuana sells at the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot box, and that's because public
opinion is so high, no pun intended,
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just mention to you that before
you go out there and assume that you
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be targeting to one demographic
or shouldn't be including one demographic
[SPEAKER_00]: in a clinical study, you should take a
look at the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody in this room is
doing that, but I just go to say that the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers are staggering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Public opinion, support for some form of a
medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by that is access to medicinal
marijuana for people that need it,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily for the people who are
answering the polling questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those polls are up as high as 90%,
so again, the numbers are staggering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talked about marijuana at the ballot box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to updating this slide in a
few short weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's gonna win big again at the
ballot box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of you who are in, or have been in the
cannabis space, be that a national
[SPEAKER_00]: operator, be that a clinical researcher,
you know what these issues are,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these are kind of the, hopefully I can
go forward and back, yeah, these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: big six issues that I'll call attention
to, and these are all because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one status of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get to, and I'm not gonna steal
Al's meets thunder from GW
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceuticals, but we can no longer say
blanket statement that there are no drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from cannabis that are solely in
schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say that so succinctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any event, cannabis is still schedule
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one FDA approved drug,
Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was approved over the summer and
just scheduled by DEA a few weeks ago as
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule five, but cannabis generally,
and it's actually marijuana with an H,
[SPEAKER_00]: for reasons I can't explain to you,
under the Controlled Substances Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is still schedule one, so don't read
any of these new headlines that say after
[SPEAKER_00]: the great news, out of GW Pharmaceuticals
that their product got approved,
[SPEAKER_00]: first cannabis derived drug that was
approved by FDA, cannabis is not
[SPEAKER_00]: descheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidiolex is not in schedule one,
it's in schedule five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to understand the
differences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Largely speaking, cannabis, schedule one,
so what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it hard to bank, makes it hard to
get intellectual property protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly on the trademark side, there's a
ton of cannabis intellectual property and
[SPEAKER_00]: patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US government holds a number of them,
go figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real estate, getting willing landlords,
getting towns to not block your zoning,
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm sure those of you who have tried to
get licensed in states know, you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: license, you work really hard,
you spend a lot of money, your team pours
[SPEAKER_00]: over an application for months and months.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get that long, some states like New
Jersey give you 30 days, and you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: cite your property, and the local town
says, nope, we're gonna make it very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult for you to establish your
business, you can't be within 1,000 yards
[SPEAKER_00]: of a daycare, 1,000 yards of a school,
1,500 yards of a house of worship,
[SPEAKER_00]: you realize that there aren't a lot of
places to put your business that anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: would wanna come visit you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in any event, that makes it very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tax deductions, I'm sure the IRS is the
bane of many folks in this room existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: As some of you know, the effective tax
rate for a lot of businesses in this space
[SPEAKER_00]: without effective planning can be in the
70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking deductions for normal things in the
cannabis business are a lot harder because
[SPEAKER_00]: again, sound like a broken record,
it's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Profits are derived from an illegal
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, careful planning, getting a CPA
firm that this is not their first foray
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cannabis space, getting tax
attorneys and regulatory attorneys who
[SPEAKER_00]: understand this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you hire us or not, I don't really
care, but I advise you to hire someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to talk to you if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug testing and discrimination,
this is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would think that if someone has a
medical card that if they test positive at
[SPEAKER_00]: work for marijuana screen, they couldn't
get fired, not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of states, you can still fire
someone or refuse to hire them if they
[SPEAKER_00]: fail a drug test, even if they have a
medical card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not talking about being under the
influence and crashing a forklift into the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of a factory, that's a for cause type
of investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an employment attorney,
but there's a difference between being
[SPEAKER_00]: under the influence at work, which I think
any employer in their right mind would
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm talking about is failing a
drug test, not being under the influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are just a couple of states,
Massachusetts I know is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts, there was a court decision
last year that essentially said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't fire someone or refuse to hire
someone simply based on a failed drug test
[SPEAKER_00]: if they have a medical card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a lot of nuances, a lot of
caveats, but you should know the laws in
[SPEAKER_00]: your states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those who think it's easy to get a
state license, I would encourage you to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the headings of the
application in Pennsylvania to get
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed to believe this is a grow process
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: These applications are a thousand pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are incredibly difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get very little guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if those of you who are used
to dealing with departments of health
[SPEAKER_00]: where you call and you get put on hold and
you eventually get to somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you an example from the state of
Maryland where I practice and do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot even call the state medical
cannabis commission and get a live person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to submit something in writing
and you're lucky if you get something back
[SPEAKER_00]: in 30 to 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gotten a little bit better now that
the first licenses are out, but good luck
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a live answer when your
applications are due, which causes things
[SPEAKER_00]: like people having the platforms to submit
their applications crash and have no
[SPEAKER_00]: recourse and then their applications are
not accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's a problem to not be able to
reach people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, this just the headings
of the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talked about Rohrabacher Blumenauer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My time is running short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very quick and dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a provision in most major spending
bills with one exception since 2013 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014 that basically says the Department of
Justice can't use funds to go after people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are in compliance with state marijuana
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, making sure that you're in
compliance with your state programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: not transporting across state lines,
not diverting to youth, not diverting to
[SPEAKER_00]: people who don't have a medical card or to
selling to people under whatever the age
[SPEAKER_00]: of your state is if you have a rec
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you want to be the best friend of
your state regulators because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to give the feds a reason to come in
and tell you you're going to lose your
[SPEAKER_00]: license or go to jail for a violation of
the Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked about how sessions were sent
to the Cole memo and how we read
[SPEAKER_00]: Rohrabacher and Blumenauer together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's unclear how the laws are going to
be enforced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all to say everyone's looking at
December 7th, which is when Rohrabacher
[SPEAKER_00]: Blumenauer expires again.
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone is hoping that this becomes
permanent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't become permanent yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Congress is very nervous to move a
big creaky rusty ship away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mentality of reefer madness and Controlled
Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all the federal legislation that's
pending.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one that I really pay attention
to right now is this hemp legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people tell me hemp is completely
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should probably tell Congress that
because they've been spending a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: time debating the fact that hemp should be
legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not suggesting that the
restrictions are the same as full blown
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but they are related.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a botanist could come up here and
give you a much better explanation than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just know they're related and Congress
looks at it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can read my slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions, please let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: State legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where a lot of this is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Alice Mead is going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need to know is that the FDA has
said you can't put this in foods or
[SPEAKER_00]: dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before someone tells you that it's a
full blown pathway to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: just know that the FDA has said you can't
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lot of this is not enforced
unless you're doing interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing within one state,
generally okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But technically the FDA says that's an
adulterated food product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read these slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you're going to hear a lot more
about the FDA approval process from Alice
[SPEAKER_00]: Mead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will be around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to the airport shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to stick around too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my contact information is on my last
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
