[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Can Med Coffee Talk
podcast, where we talk with the leading
[SPEAKER_01]: minds in cannabis science, medicine,
cultivation, and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the senior marketing manager at
Medicinal Genomics and proud member of the
[SPEAKER_01]: team that puts on the Can Med Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are back from our summer break.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you didn't miss us too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are also working hard on finalizing the
detailed details for our Can Med 25 event,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will be announced very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you haven't yet, please go to
canmedevents.com now and sign up for email
[SPEAKER_01]: alerts so you can get that announcement
once it's made.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are also putting the finishing touches
on the Can Med 24 video presentations and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll be adding those to the Can Med
archive very soon as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're on the email list,
you'll get that notification as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Zach Riccardi.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a cannabis specialist working with
Bio Safe Systems, which is a company that
[SPEAKER_01]: produces environmentally sustainable
products to protect crops, water,
[SPEAKER_01]: and people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zach regularly puts out content on social
media under the name Zach the Grow Guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: where he shares his extensive knowledge of
production and plant health that he has
[SPEAKER_01]: accrued over the years working with all
types of growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zach also authored the book Clean Growing,
Integrated Pest Management for Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers, The Ultimate Guide to Clean
Crops, and Safe Cultivation Practices that
[SPEAKER_01]: Protect Growers and Consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: During our conversation, we discuss what
is IPM and why is it important to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, how Zach got involved with IPM
for cannabis, how cannabis growers can
[SPEAKER_01]: implement IPM into their operations,
common pests and pathogens that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: growers are battling, common mistakes
cannabis growers make when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Zach, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Founded in 1999, Advanced Nutrients was
the first to develop a complete nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: system that unlocks the true genetic
potential of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since its inception, the brand has
introduced more than 50 innovations to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation community and continues to
revolutionize the space through
[SPEAKER_01]: proprietary scientific discoveries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn more at AdvancedNutrients.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Zach
[SPEAKER_01]: Riccardi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Zach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you having me on here
and shout out to Medical Genomics for
[SPEAKER_00]: putting this on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm excited to talk with you today
about integrated pest management for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a topic that you've literally wrote
the book on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how I became familiar with you is I
was actually sitting at the cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: workshop at CanMed24, which was just a few
weeks ago or in May, and IPM came up
[SPEAKER_01]: during the panel conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the panelists, I don't recall who
it was, but mentioned you and your book,
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean Growing, Integrated Pest Management
for Cannabis Growers, The Ultimate Guide
[SPEAKER_01]: to Clean Crops and Safe Cultivation
Practices that Protect Growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mentioned that specifically and said that
you are the person to talk to and you are
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy when it comes to IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I quickly jotted that name down and
made sure to reach out to you to get you
[SPEAKER_01]: on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm so happy that you're here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe just to get us started,
kind of set the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a bit about your background,
how you got into cannabis IPM and why it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of fell into cannabis IPM almost
out of necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in love with cannabis my entire
life and grew up in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I turned 18, I basically moved out to
California to kind of chase the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator dream and operated under SB420
and Prop 215 in the state of California
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to kind of get on with the
Gardening Unlimited crew who were the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: that were basically selling the supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really kind of killed my passion
for the why, not just the what.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of cannabis growers that
follow charts, but they never ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: why are we doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kind of wanted to take that
deeper delve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally being from Colorado,
when our industry here started to snowball
[SPEAKER_00]: and blow up, I had a lot of people telling
me that I needed to come home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually ran a smaller hydroponic
store in Golden, Colorado for,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say about two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran it from the day that it opened to
the day that it moved to Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the owner decided that they were
going to relocate, it was time for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of separate paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually painted bikes for
Harley-Davidson for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I got on with a company called ACW
Supply here in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are Colorado's oldest wholesale
grower supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been around since 1893.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being a counter guy there really kind
of jump started my IPM path, I guess we
[SPEAKER_00]: could say, because I was able to talk to
many different aspects of growers in a
[SPEAKER_00]: single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is when cannabis was really
starting to snowball in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being the counter guy, I would talk to
a potato grower, a poinsettia grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a hemp grower and a cannabis grower
all in the same day, and they all had the
[SPEAKER_00]: same issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was kind of able to conglomerate
that knowledge and make suggestions across
[SPEAKER_00]: different fields for the culture and say,
well, this sector is trying this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this sector is trying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Colorado came out with what is
called the approved list, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a list of pesticides,
fungicides, bactericides that are safe to
[SPEAKER_00]: put on a consumable crop like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being in the very early days,
being involved in seeing what that list
[SPEAKER_00]: was looking like, I was able to put
together a very comprehensive approach for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growers in a commercial
environment to rotate their chemistries
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively so that they're able to
maximize their productivity and man hours
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's a lot of stuff on these
lists that's kind of misleading or
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to, you know,
again, amarrate that knowledge from large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale growers and be able to break down an
acre to, you know, a four by eight table
[SPEAKER_00]: really helped me out in terms of being
able to make some of this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: understandable for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there was a long time ago,
there was this mentality in cannabis where
[SPEAKER_00]: if you got certain ailments, you just chop
down and start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, traditional growers don't
have that luxury and being able to see
[SPEAKER_00]: that and say like, you know, a cucumber
grower can't clean out their greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: because they got powdery mildew and start
from scratch, they would go bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to have something that could
eliminate this powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if they're organic certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has to be a solution out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just hadn't found it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, being able to work with
some of the largest grows in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States at this point, I feel that the
BioSafe SOP, it does have some ancillary
[SPEAKER_00]: products on there because I always say,
you know, I'd never hire an electrician to
[SPEAKER_00]: put in a toilet for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the foundation covered very,
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on the unique scenario,
there are some ancillary products from I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't necessarily want to call them
competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say other producers of similar,
you know, organic pesticides, fungicides,
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides, they fit into the program
very well so that the grower can be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any one company that's telling you that
they have all the answers is just trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to take your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the reasons I was probably
brought up on this panel is because I want
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will often recommend things to
complement our program that BioSafe
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't manufacture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because I want you to be able
to eliminate this issue and also have that
[SPEAKER_00]: feather in your cap, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if this comes up again,
you know what to do to come full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those growers that their mentality was to
just chop down and start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the next time this happens,
now you've lost two crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now is your solution more of a kind of
reactive?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to address it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it or is it preventative?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it both?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always preach preventative over
curative, but there are scenarios where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, things find their way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the book, Clean Growing,
I do have preventative measures as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: curative measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that growers just get used
to the idea of IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's kind of been the
redheaded stepchild of the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it doesn't really matter until it
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's the only thing that matters
because growers freak out and they start
[SPEAKER_00]: spending a bunch of money trying to
eliminate issues that will compromise the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of their end product, where,
you know, the best plan would be to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something in place ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff still finds its way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: ACs fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: People quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's ancillary stuff that we
always have to deal with beyond what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, just like we have to water
these plants, we also have to spray them
[SPEAKER_00]: and be that intermediary because we've
created a perfect environment for these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also created a perfect environment
for pests because there's no natural
[SPEAKER_00]: predation in these facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a root aphid, a spider mite,
a thrip finds its way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That growth curve is exponential unless
we're spraying because they're just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow unchecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like we need to water these
plants, we need to make sure that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a program in place to where we are that
intermediary to go after anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: could find its way into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, recommending some
other company stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, I really only like to spray
up until about week three of flower unless
[SPEAKER_00]: it's absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, we can deploy BCAs,
which are our biological control agents,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as our beneficial insects,
our nematodes, basically using mother
[SPEAKER_00]: nature to combat whatever else we could
find in that garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows growers to actually have a
successful approach in that aspect because
[SPEAKER_00]: they know what they're targeting at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been spraying these plants,
from propagation all the way up until
[SPEAKER_00]: about week three, and you're in that
environment, you know what kind of pests
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if we're dealing with two
dotted spider mites, you know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need persimilis and californicus to be
able to eliminate that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in that garden and spraying isn't
just trying to eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's prepping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's note taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's allowing you to basically set up that
next week for the most amount of success
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can possibly have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by, you know, basically spraying up
until that week three cutoff, week three
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly, it's when we transition from
stretching into setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some varieties that might be
a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some varieties that might be a
little sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, we want to make sure that
we're addressing that wide array of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that could find its way in because while
BCAs work very, very well then,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're specialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, plumbers put in toilets,
electricians put in circuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all beneficial insects are going to go
after everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see people deploy ladybugs and
they say they have spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great that you introduced a bunch
of ladybugs and they made some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: those spider mites, but it's not a
specialized food source for that insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're kind of wasting money at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: By being in the garden and having these
notes and knowing what happened last week,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can tailor your approach next week so
that you are going to have the most
[SPEAKER_00]: success you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, before we get too deep into it,
I'm hoping, can you explain or define what
[SPEAKER_01]: is integrated pest management?
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrated pest management to me is all
things growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a position that one person
is assigned at the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally on the entire team.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there's one person that's probably
doing the sprays and doing the logs and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the heavy lifting, IPM is on
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we've got a lazy team of trimmers and
they go into a dirty environment and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they go into veg, well, then we just
contaminated veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to educate the entire workforce
that's at a facility, at a grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: at a garden, that IPM is on everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to move consciously.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to think about what we're doing
and we have to try to eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-contamination wherever possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always go to our cleanest areas first.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have potential issues, I always am a
proponent of using irrigation marker flags
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can tell everybody on the team
that there's an issue that you've spotted
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to verbally say anything to
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that walks into that room,
if they see a red flag sticking out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, whatever your facility deemed the red
flag notates to, they'll look at that and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey, I need to avoid that area until
I'm done in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, I'm not contaminating
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM is a cultural practice of cleanliness
across the board and it is a preventative
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as curative approach to eliminate
issues that could possibly facilitate
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves in a horticulture environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that differ from traditional pest
control methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the only difference between
cannabis IPM and what we'll call
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional IPM is the types of
chemistries that are used and the
[SPEAKER_00]: longevity of said chemistries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cannabis is a consumable,
most of the stuff that is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed on cannabis is going to be what
they call a GRAS or generally regarded as
[SPEAKER_00]: safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to see the long-lived
systemic pesticides that they'll use on
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamentals because they're poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've been around for a long
enough period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's heard of Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle 20 is a chemistry that is used in
traditional horticulture and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily the boogeyman in that aspect
because people aren't combusting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myclobutanol or Eagle 20 really becomes
dangerous once it's lit on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You create benzene and hydrocarbon once
it's combusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a cannabis crop, it's not a good fit,
but if you were to spray it on your leafy
[SPEAKER_00]: greens, your tomatoes, whatever,
because those are on the label,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes through your digestive tract and
it's unchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have that carboxyl group
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like with THCA and Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how when you put THC on fire,
it becomes Delta 9?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same premise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having some of these chemistries that are
in traditional horticulture, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily as safe and they don't have
the residuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis growers have to be a little bit
more diligent and educated in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: what the spray that they're doing right
now is going to do and how that next spray
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to do is going to either
compliment or contradict what they just
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you would never want to spray
a biological inoculant and then spray a
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitizer, but if you did it in the ad
verse and you sprayed a sanitizer and then
[SPEAKER_00]: a biological inoculant, the inoculant will
actually perform better because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it onto a clean tissue environment
where it can colonize and spread much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier than if you were to try to put it
onto a dirty environment and then follow
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a sanitizer a couple days later
and kill all those sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is just the rotation of
certain chemistries and making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using as different a mode of action
as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't necessarily have that same IRAC
group classification that traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture has where it says this is the
IRAC group three, it does this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, and this is the IRAC group four,
it does this, this, and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the pesticides and fungicides
that cannabis growers have are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: contact or very short-lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing how to play those off of one
another so that the grower has the most
[SPEAKER_00]: success allows them to basically stack an
IPM regimen to where again, every spray is
[SPEAKER_00]: complimenting the one that preceded it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you include plant pathogens within that
definition there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your Hothlatenviroid and Fusarium,
Pythium, all those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pests can be anything from a single-celled
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viroids are very, very small, 25 to 50
nanometers in size all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: baying aphids that are the size of a BB
almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole different slew of stuff
that can attack the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, pest management is going to be
you being the intermediary for everything
[SPEAKER_00]: from the stuff you see to the stuff you
can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: How unique is the program to each
facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a general protocol that they
should be following or is it very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the book, I have what I call the recipe
for bread, which is just the basic outline
[SPEAKER_00]: of the rotation of a growth-regulant style
chemistry, which is more than likely going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be azadirachtin in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to call the heavy hitters,
which are going to be your
[SPEAKER_00]: myco-insecticides like your Bavaria
bassiana, your Burkholdera, your Asaria
[SPEAKER_00]: firmosia, your metaheresium type
chemistries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on Fridays, just so we can keep the
pressure on the button, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: and depending on the scenario,
that's when we would use either a sulfur,
[SPEAKER_00]: a citric acid, or possibly an insecticidal
soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each scenario is a little bit different,
but it allows the grower to basically
[SPEAKER_00]: tailor their approach to best fit what
they're dealing with at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That point in time, and because the base
of the program really doesn't change a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot, it allows them to be able to
make minute changes while still staying on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same basic premise so that your guys
aren't saying like, oh, we did this last
[SPEAKER_00]: week and now we're over here doing
something completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few minute changes that occur,
but the nice thing about it is that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: broad enough that it can address most of
the issues that we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if we're doing this as a
preventative, then we don't have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into that necessarily specialized section
of it where it's like, okay, we're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with russet mites specifically,
or we're dealing with root aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's when we make little changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a general just overview SOP of
just trying to keep things clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty universal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know in researching IPM,
there's all these articles that talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: the different tenants of it, and it can be
anywhere from four to six or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that one of the main ones is
the whole idea of identification and
[SPEAKER_01]: monitoring, which is what you had talked
about before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the signs that growers
should be looking for in order to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: a problem before it snowballs out of
control?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I always try to have
growers do is empower their staff because
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower is only one person, and in any
given facility, there's thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have people that are looking at
those plants every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empower your staff to come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to be an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they know when something's not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant looks different than it did
yesterday, have them come tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things that if you don't
allow your staff... I don't want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: have your staff think that they're making
a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, people will not go and
tell the head grower that something's
[SPEAKER_00]: amiss because they don't want it to come
back on them like, oh, well, then you did
[SPEAKER_00]: this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empower your people to say, if there is
anything that's off, let's figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this plant looks different than it did
yesterday, if it's got purple stems,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's got stippling on the leaves,
if the tragedy is gone and the leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to curl down, if they're starting
to curl up, anything that just looks
[SPEAKER_00]: amiss, allow your... How do I put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily have to have a team
of master growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to have a team of diligent
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as there's one person on staff
that can say, okay, there's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most facilities have one maintenance guy
that fixes ACs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not on everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have one guy that's responsible
for plant health and pathogen mitigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: when somebody finds something,
he can say, hey, I got to go tell Ben what
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it could be that they topped it
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that it's HLV.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that there's an actual issue
going on beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having the ability and that
communication between your team is
[SPEAKER_00]: paramount because those are the guys that
are in the trenches, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to empower your team to let
you know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, the head grower is only in
one spot at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having the ability to have a team that
can relay real-world information to you
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flag system that I was mentioning a
little bit, that really helps a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: because a head grower can stick his head
in a room and count flags in 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great way to also track
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had 10 red flags last week and this
week we're down to five, then what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to continue on that process that
we have implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are at 15 red flags this week and
last week we only had 10, then we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: switch it up because it's getting worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so communication is, I think,
the most important part of integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the communication definitely seems
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, it's a culture,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how common is that the culture in
cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it becoming more of a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see more and more operations becoming
more and more regimented in terms of how
[SPEAKER_00]: they do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it's state regulations that
have facilitated that change or people
[SPEAKER_00]: just realizing that they have to run
leaner because the market isn't what it
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having the ability to educate staff and
get them all on the same page and empower
[SPEAKER_00]: people, I think, is the way that the
successful grows are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you punish your employees for trying to
do their best, they're not going to want
[SPEAKER_00]: to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk to you about some of the
common pests or problems that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: growers just always seem to be dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the four most common things
that I run into traveling the country are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be thrips, root aphids,
hoplite and viroid, and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips can be kind of a problem because a
lot of times folks will only attack one
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle stage of this infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips actually have a point where they
live in the canopy and they have a point
[SPEAKER_00]: where they live in the strata of your
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're not treating both,
you're going to see these ebbs and flows
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're gone for two weeks,
they come back, they're gone for two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, they come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, educating growers that
doing a sprench application with thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: really does allow them to get ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root aphids are extremely hard to get rid
of just because they're incredibly adept
[SPEAKER_00]: at what people have been throwing at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've found to be the most effective
method to attack root aphids is to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do an irrigation cycle before you
do any drenches or sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run away from that moisture of the
first irrigation cycle of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get those pots wet and get them
complacent to the fact that that moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: is there, they're less apt to try to run
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whatever we're putting out via a
drench, sprench or spray is going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: much better likelihood of actually coming
in contact with them because they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: just trying to run from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poplatin viroid is something that a lot of
growers have it, but they don't know they
[SPEAKER_00]: have it until they have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this comes back to that
cultural practices thing and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of falls on everybody and just the
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: That viroid can be transferred via dirty
matter, can be transferred mechanically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it grows from one plant to another,
doesn't wash his hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be spread by tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be spread by runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be spread by insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very prevalent pathogen and a lot
of folks don't take it as seriously as
[SPEAKER_00]: they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some grows that have completely
realized that it can decimate their
[SPEAKER_00]: business and they will test their moms
before they take cuts every single round
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're doing everything they need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are growers that still use
a single cup of Clon-X and dip every
[SPEAKER_00]: single cut in that same hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, if there's any
contamination, you guys just spread it
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, honestly, I feel like the
viroids and pathogens are going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardest thing for the cannabis industry to
address because you don't know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have them until you have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you have them, we can go into
remission, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get it to a point where the plant
can still finish, but those genetics are
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to keep them on board would be to,
you know, facilitate the downfall of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: else that you have in your stable,
because again, that can transfer so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways and so easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that a lot of growers,
the latent portion of this viroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: if your plants are healthy, you're not
going to see what it can do right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time, the plant health starts to
go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the patient isn't necessarily
bedridden when they're first diagnosed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the longer they are alive,
that line goes like this and the sicker
[SPEAKER_00]: they become.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, to compromise an entire
business with HLV is just, it's very scary
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will compromise your harvest,
your THC percentages plummet, your bag
[SPEAKER_00]: appeal goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the medicinal value of the plant is
just not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're basically growing hemp at
that point, like you're compliant with the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm bill almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought of it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last, you know, most common pathogen
that I see is powdery mildew, just because
[SPEAKER_00]: it is very prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times growers won't do everything
they need to do to eliminate said issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is something that can be gotten rid
of fairly easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I always tell people is make
sure your environment's on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't set your temp to 60 and your
dehu to 10 and then hit those numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: your environment isn't where it needs to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are folks that say,
oh, I can get it to where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't hit those parameters,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first thing growers have to do
is make sure that their HVAC is up to
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, you know, air conditioning is up
to point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their dehu is where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're still experiencing powdery
mildew, that's when we say, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's look at what we can spray to,
you know, basically kind of hinder this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing in its tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got some really cool options for
cannabis growers that have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: very safe application methods and,
you know, zero residual aspects in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of dangerous stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it just allows them to
basically get on that schedule of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, it's, it's flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to spray oxyphos and xerotol,
or, you know, it's Wednesday, we got to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit a micro insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, to touch on what you kind
of said earlier in my program,
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday, Wednesday, Friday for preventative
is spray days, Tuesday and Thursday is
[SPEAKER_00]: plant work and scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we get from, you know,
basically curative into preventative,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I said that wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said preventative, but I meant curative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get into the preventative mode,
we actually flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
we're doing scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday, Thursday, we're doing our sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is that you are in there
looking at the plants as much as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying or defoliating or doing anything
else, because we have to evaluate our
[SPEAKER_00]: progress and, you know, keep a lot of
logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't write down what we're doing in
a month, we won't remember what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if we did anything right or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, grows are very cyclical in terms
of what happened last June, likely is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen this June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you can go back to your log last
year and say, shit, we had thrips on the
[SPEAKER_00]: 14th when it got really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you look at your calendar and you
say, okay, it's going to get up to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 102 or whatever, I'm
anticipating thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put out your ambacillus,
cucumeris, you know, beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_00]: and later flower, and then do your sprays
and your veg and your prop and your early
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and combat the, you know,
thrips before they ever even get
[SPEAKER_00]: established.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I wanted to go back to when you were
talking about the pathogens and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it sounded like one of the main
challenges with that is you don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: know you have it until it's too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that sense, do you sort of advocate
for, you know, regular testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Full disclosure, medicinal genomics,
we develop qPCR assays for hoplite and
[SPEAKER_01]: bioroid, pusarium, pythium, a lot of the
plant pathogens that folks use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're trying to spread the
word to growers that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: should make that part of their program to
do testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that you would agree
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every other aspect of horticulture that is
traditional does tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to a tomato grower greenhouse,
they're doing it once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know how to adjust their feeds
if they don't know what the plant's up
[SPEAKER_00]: taking and what it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's nutritional
analysis, but being able to have this
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen testing is paramount.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a dirty genetic and you put,
you know, 2000 clones into production,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a loss because that 2000 clones
with where the market is now, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to spend more money, labor, and time than
you're going to be able to recoup off of
[SPEAKER_00]: that crop at that point, if you can even
sell it, because it's not going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out looking like it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an advocate of, you know, having a
test allows us to make educated decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't know what we're dealing with,
then we're just throwing stuff at the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you cut clones, if you bring in
something new, you know, even quarterly,
[SPEAKER_00]: test your stable just to make sure
everything is where it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anything that comes in brand new
should always be quarantined and tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those, you know, plants should
have clones cut off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as those clones off of the
plants you brought in look okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can put it into production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a mistake I've seen time and
time again where growers are excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: get some hype genetic they put into
production right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, you know,
shit, I just infected half of my stable
[SPEAKER_00]: with XYZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and now going back to the pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I sort of saw in my
research, too, is this sort of this idea
[SPEAKER_01]: of setting thresholds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there like a certain amount of pest
that's sort of like, okay, as long as we
[SPEAKER_01]: can manage it and, you know, keep it down
or?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in a perfect world, brother,
the perfect number would be zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in a fluid environment where
you've got people coming in and out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility all day long, you know,
depending on the type of facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a greenhouse, every time you open
your louvers to ventilate the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: we potentially introduce contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the M in IPM stands for management,
you're never going to completely be ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: of everything, you will always have
something to do the next day, because
[SPEAKER_00]: nature never quits, you know, it will
always try to find its way in or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, do its best to stifle what it is
we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the acceptable level is
low pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, don't get complacent and
say, oh, we've got mites, but they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got mites, but we're
treating them as the right approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get complacent with something,
that's when other issues start to
[SPEAKER_00]: snowball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so low pressure isn't unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, make sure that you're doing
your best to get that to as close to no
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, because it's farming,
if we wipe one issue out, then something
[SPEAKER_00]: else is going to pop up tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the nature of the beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So winding down here, I'm curious,
you know, are there some common mistakes
[SPEAKER_01]: that growers make when they're
implementing IPM that they could avoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common mistake that I see is that
growers don't necessarily look at active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients, they're just looking at brand
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, one time I went to a
facility here in Denver and the grower had
[SPEAKER_00]: clarified hydrophobic extract of neem oil,
azadirachtin, and neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are all basically the exact same
thing, just different versions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was wondering why he wasn't having
success with his issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, brother, you're using
three versions of the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, being able to differentiate
between actives really allows growers to
[SPEAKER_00]: get those different modes of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, making sure that they are
pHing their sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of it is something that I've
seen some growers neglect to do like
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll pH their reservoirs every time,
but they won't pH their sprays for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that sometimes is a whoopsie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that I see a lot of
growers do, man, and this is not knocking
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody, but you know, water quality isn't
necessarily the best in some places of the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers will spray with RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And RO, as you know, is acidic,
comes out of the machine at seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you let it sit for 24 hours,
it's going to be pH of something like five
[SPEAKER_00]: five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they add something like citric
acid to it, it's going to be a pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: something like three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spray a pH of three on your plants,
man, you're going to see some phyto and
[SPEAKER_00]: burn some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I typically recommend to
growers is if you've got really dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: water and you cannot spray with TAP,
take some of your base NPK, spike it to
[SPEAKER_00]: about 0.3 EC, get a little bit of that
bicarbonate content from that fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: back into that water column.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, if you do have to buffer it
or add something else to it, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have the drastic swings that it
would without that bicarbonate content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime growers are spraying Xeritol,
I tell them if you're using RO,
[SPEAKER_00]: spike it to 0.3 EC, and they add the
Xeritol, and nine out of 10 times,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll fall between five five and six two,
which is perfect for a foliar app.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking ahead, are there any
advancements or innovations that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about when it comes to IPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the the realm of myco
insecticides is continuing to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nature against nature really is my
favorite approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother Nature has been doing this a lot
longer than we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's got checks and balances for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to utilize more natural
products and get further away from
[SPEAKER_00]: petrochemicals and stuff that harms
pollinators and hurts the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: really is going to, I think, allow pest
management to be looked at as not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily this big boogeyman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you hear the word insecticide,
pesticide, people always think Monsanto,
[SPEAKER_00]: Roundup, cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like there's to farm on scale,
you have to be able to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't necessarily have to use those
chemistries that poison the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biosafe are mantras to try to leave the
planet better than we found it,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to address a lot of these
issues that these gnarly chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: address.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it without hurting the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the future, I'm just excited to
see more of these really cancerous,
[SPEAKER_00]: gnarly chemistries be replaced by stuff
that works that is safer for the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: and for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I let you go, are there any
other research resources besides your
[SPEAKER_01]: book, which I will put a link to in the
show notes so people can can find that on
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But are there other resources,
papers or anything like that that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could recommend that if people are
interested in learning more about what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely have a really good Instagram
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go onto the IGTV tab, when the
pandemic first started, I used to do these
[SPEAKER_00]: things called fireside chats where I would
just talk about a different aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation that has everything from
trimming to curing to russet mites and
[SPEAKER_00]: root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything and everything I could think of
talking about, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody that wants to watch free
videos, all the stuff that's in the book
[SPEAKER_00]: is also on those videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sometimes you don't have eight
hours to come through videos to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I really recommend that anybody
that's serious about the industry get onto
[SPEAKER_00]: a website called MMJ Daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, on the horticulture site,
it's called Horta Daily, but MMJ Daily is
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis specific daily newsletter that
gets sent to your inbox and it talks about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see what the Netherlands are
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what Israel is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what South Africa is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what Germany is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what Canada is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, it keeps you really abreast
of what's going on in cannabis as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you that kind of thousand
yard view of the industry and allows you
[SPEAKER_00]: to know what's coming before it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I'll talk about legislation
that's potential and you'll know about
[SPEAKER_00]: something six months before it's talked
about on MSNBC or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Zach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks again for doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we can see you out at CanMed
once we announce the details for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heck yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep me posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having us on and
enjoy your weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do.
Thank you.
