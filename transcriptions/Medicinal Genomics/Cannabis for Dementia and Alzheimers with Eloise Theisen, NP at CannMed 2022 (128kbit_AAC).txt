[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to the CanMed Coffee Talk
Lounge here at CanMed 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Ben Amaralt, host of the
CanMed Coffee Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am joined today by Eloise Thiessen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eloise, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, how nice is it to be back at
an in-person event?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your opinion, what are the main
takeaways that you get from an in-person
[SPEAKER_00]: event like CanMed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's great to be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good to see people and reconnect.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite part is getting to actually
have in-person conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's something missing in
that virtual Zoom world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you just can't connect with
people the same way you can in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of opportunities to ask questions,
too, and talk about our experiences in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way that you don't get to on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's important to bring
that up because we do make the
[SPEAKER_00]: presentations available on our YouTube
channel and in our archive, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's those networking opportunities,
those conversations in between the talks
[SPEAKER_00]: that you get the real value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the hugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugs are nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any presentations at this year's
event in particular that you're interested
[SPEAKER_00]: or looking forward to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely looking forward to hearing
from Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to hearing from Dr.
Bonnie Goldstein as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always love hearing Dr. Dustin Sulak
because you get a lot of that clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: implications and how they practice real
world, real life experience with patients
[SPEAKER_01]: that you just get to take away great
nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a big part of our practicum as
are you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in there a little bit earlier
and I saw during your welcome that you
[SPEAKER_00]: asked how many people in the audience this
was their first experience doing medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis training.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of hands that went up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say about two thirds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we need more trained physicians
and nurses and nurse practitioners out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very important that your health care team
starts to understand the value,
[SPEAKER_01]: the risks, the benefits of cannabis,
because as we know, our patients are using
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no turning back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Train has left the station.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your presentation, in addition to your
time on the practicum, in addition to your
[SPEAKER_00]: being a panelist on a panel, it's all
about managing Alzheimer's and dementia
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I was wondering, can you speak to
how common these symptoms are,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in assisted living communities
and what makes them so difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the neuropsychiatric symptoms that
we see in dementia happens in the later
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So early diagnosis, you may just start to
notice memory loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these symptoms of agitation,
anxiety, aggression really start to come
[SPEAKER_01]: as their memories become even more void.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, they're usually not even
recognizing their loved ones or their
[SPEAKER_01]: family members.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can tell that there is this
constant state of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually quite heartbreaking to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have any FDA approved
medications to manage these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are either using off label
medications or they're looking to try
[SPEAKER_01]: something sort of outside of the box like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw that in your abstract as well,
where you said that there are no FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: approved medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's surprising given how prevalent it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is that the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for me, what is really interesting
is to see that the medications that we do
[SPEAKER_01]: use, like antipsychotics, have this black
box warning, which means there's a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: risk of death associated with use in
dementia patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even what we are trying to use feels
like the risk is way bigger than any
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that more research probably goes
into trying to figure out how to prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: or slow down the cognitive decline
associated with dementia, but not into the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual managing of the behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an opportunity or is there a
potential to use cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative medication?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely some preclinical data
to suggest that it's a neuroprotectant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it reduces inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a small study looking at it
preventing the beta amyloid plaque build
[SPEAKER_01]: up, although there's some debate now
whether or not beta amyloid plaques are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually contributing to Alzheimer's
disease specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to see more research in
that area to see if it can help with the
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-aging process that, of course,
can contribute to dementia as we age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we mentioned that there are no
FDA approved medications now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think the chances are of
getting an FDA approved cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medication for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's interesting is Sadavex,
which is not approved in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, has been studied for the use of
neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think there's an opportunity for
that one-to-one CBD THC oral mucosal spray
[SPEAKER_01]: to be used to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the results have been incredibly
promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been helping with sleep and
agitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you see a return to appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see improved quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see improved quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think until we actually have approval
of something like that here in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, I mean, it's going to be a while,
but I hope so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and it's great that you mentioned sort
of that improving the quality of life
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know especially dealing with
geriatric patients, that's a major concern
[SPEAKER_00]: or a major goal, I should say,
is improving that quality of life and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe speak to how cannabis can help with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's actually the
conversation I love to have with the
[SPEAKER_01]: family members because often when they
come to me, they are usually saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I want to try CBD for, you know,
my mom or my dad's behaviors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, really THC, a lot of the
data does support that THC is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having that conversation with them
because they're a little scared of THC
[SPEAKER_01]: about what does euphoria look like for
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so letting them know that,
you know, well, maybe your dad's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: smile again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he might laugh at things,
find things funny again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, usually they go,
you know, that'd be really nice to see my
[SPEAKER_01]: dad happy again.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, but it's very anxiety producing for
the family members and caregivers to see
[SPEAKER_01]: how distressed their loved one is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really does have this like positive
domino effect to just see them making
[SPEAKER_01]: jokes again, or engaging in conversation
the best they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now are you finding those
conversations are becoming easier to have
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, seniors or families are
becoming more receptive to using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: just because, you know, whether it's the
anecdotal evidence or the actual evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been coming out seems to support
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also helps when in the assisted
living communities, I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: champions there, both staff, caregivers,
other families who have been, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: having their loved ones use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a lot of community support
around it and acceptance, which has been
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, sometimes I have patients
who have such great success that their
[SPEAKER_01]: spouse will actually go up to the other
family member and say, let me tell you a
[SPEAKER_01]: little secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my wife on these gummies,
you know, you should consider it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I wanted to ask you too is,
you know, there's a growing interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin or psychedelic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even us at medicinal
genomics, we're beginning to explore that
[SPEAKER_00]: and see how we can sort of help move that
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious, is there any sort of evidence
or potential for using psilocybin to help
[SPEAKER_00]: with these conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, specifically in the
neuropsychiatric symptoms?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I think there's great opportunity
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, you know, with looking at,
you know, palliative care, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when people are diagnosed with a terminal
illness, but maybe they're going to live
[SPEAKER_01]: for years, like with dementia and
Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we really have a missed
opportunity of how do we help these people
[SPEAKER_01]: still enjoy life?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where's the pleasure for them,
whether that's with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelics and psilocybin or
cannabinoids and euphoria, listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: music again, you know, having those
pleasurable moments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's great opportunity and we
know that we're seeing psilocybin helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: for things like mental health challenges
and pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know there's, there's room for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to feel good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in wrapping up here, I did want to get
your thoughts that, you know, given that
[SPEAKER_00]: so much of the research that's being done
into medical cannabis is being done by
[SPEAKER_00]: private companies in a lot of ways,
just because of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the realities of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is it for those companies to
come to events like CanMed and share those
[SPEAKER_00]: insights so that, you know, the whole
community can kind of benefit from that
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can help these patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I think it's essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, we need to be listening
to each other in terms of what everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and, you know, again, figuring out
how do we come together as a community to
[SPEAKER_01]: really help these patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different unique perspectives that
people have that you may not really,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, understand unless you're coming to
these events, networking, having an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to ask these questions that,
you know, maybe you didn't even think of
[SPEAKER_01]: until you're in the moment with those
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would really love to see the
industry come together more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that the different
perspectives, and that's one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: we like to focus on at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the wonderful healthcare providers
like you and Bonnie and Dustin,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then we bring in the cultivators and
the lab safety testing and everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much to learn when it comes to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see why it's intimidating for some
healthcare professionals because I never
[SPEAKER_01]: understood the value of, you know,
learning more about botany, but that has
[SPEAKER_01]: been, I hope, an opening for me as a
clinician and the lab testing and the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't do what I do unless I
understood all of those components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we couldn't do what we do without
people like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to our sponsors,
Medicine Women Health and the Hemp Coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: Exchange for sponsoring this great CanMed
Coffee Talk Lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be back with more.
Thank you.
