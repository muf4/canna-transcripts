[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a customer that was in desperate
need of triptych soy broth and we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple hiccups that were out of our
control and getting it to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: weather issues and what not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were actually out at the moment,
so I had gotten some from our R&D team,
[SPEAKER_00]: was able to get the order together,
but unfortunately our FedEx guy had
[SPEAKER_00]: already came and went.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bounced around between a couple
different FedEx locations and after some
[SPEAKER_00]: trials and tribulations and getting
everything straightened out, the only
[SPEAKER_00]: FedEx location left was at Logan Airport
in Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get there with about an hour to
spare, thinking everything's all set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walk in, she goes, you know,
you printed the shipping label out,
[SPEAKER_00]: landscaped instead of portrait,
so I can't scan it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can't scan it, I can't ship it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, okay, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run to my car real quick, come back in,
sitting on the floor at FedEx on my
[SPEAKER_00]: laptop, revising and changing the shipping
labels from landscape to portrait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ask her, you know, what's the
wireless network here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can email you these and she says,
you know, there's no wireless network.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all hardwired there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I'm trying to connect to the
hotspot on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, it's a dead zone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to work either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to go out to the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go out to the parking lot on a brisk
November night with my laptop on one hand
[SPEAKER_00]: and my phone in the other, trying to hold
them up to the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally get the email to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: She checks her email.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got it, but unfortunately she couldn't
open the PDF with the shipping labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, then at that point I go,
listen, this is critically important that
[SPEAKER_00]: we get this order out tonight for our
customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also come too far and invested
too much time into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, well, I just don't know what to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say, what if I get behind the desk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I log into my company's FedEx account,
reprint the labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, if you think you can do it
in less than 10 minutes, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out behind the desk, printed out the
labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the order out and the customer was
taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is a testament to the
culture of medicinal genomics and product
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiators are great and we have a
lot of those, but one of our biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive advantages is our support and
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our customers know that we're always
going to be honest and transparent with
[SPEAKER_00]: them and always try to go above and
beyond.
