[SPEAKER_02]: So for many of you who have heard me speak
before or seen some of the things I've
[SPEAKER_02]: done, you'll see this is a bit of a
contrast to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you remember what we're trying to
do all this time is to solve the question
[SPEAKER_02]: of is there a way to accurately
consistently dose cannabinoids across
[SPEAKER_02]: disease sets over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being the question that we're
trying to solve, we're doing it by the
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical experience that we're having
working with, excuse me, working with
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working with patients through Aunt
Zelda's.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pre-clinical research is going on with
Complutense University and other
[SPEAKER_02]: researchers like Didi and others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also through Zelda Therapeutics,
which is the hat that I'm wearing here
[SPEAKER_02]: today, where we're actually funding the
clinical trials and the pre-clinical work
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going on to prove out some of these
theories so that we can answer this dosing
[SPEAKER_02]: question and create solutions for
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a collaboration that went on
between Spain, California, and Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a lot of work done in the
past showing the anti-tumor effect of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: In most cases, the ones that have been
studied have been using pure compounds of
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's fantastic evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you get into the human trials and
human looking at the anecdotal and the
[SPEAKER_02]: experience that we're having working with
patients, this is not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_02]: case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've done is we've hypothesized
that whole plant extracts are,
[SPEAKER_02]: in fact, more effective anti-tumor tools
than pure compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why do we believe this?
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe it because, as our previous
speaker, and excuse my typo there,
[SPEAKER_02]: because as our previous speaker has said,
there are hundreds of compounds that we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know even what they are yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now apparently we do have ways that we can
test, and I look forward to collaborating
[SPEAKER_02]: more on those things with you moving
forward because it's all about solving
[SPEAKER_02]: this conundrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because there's other cannabinoids in
there, and there's other cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: within the plant itself that contain
anti-tumor properties, such as the THCA,
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDA, and et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also other non-cannabinoid
compounds within it that activate the
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors, such as beta carofalene that
has been shown to activate the CB2
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors and also have effects on the
tumor response as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because there's so many things that
have not been studied, how can we reduce
[SPEAKER_02]: it down to a pure compound and say this is
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if it doesn't work on one,
does that mean that there's no other
[SPEAKER_02]: solution?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, last time I looked on seed finder,
there were over 10,000 different cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably boils down to quite a few
less.
[SPEAKER_02]: But depending on where within the
greenhouse it's being grown, what part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the hill it's being grown, what time of
day you pick, all these different factors,
[SPEAKER_02]: it greatly influences what the actual
compound is going to contain within the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also evidence already in things
like Marinol that is a pure compound,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it's a synthetic in this case,
that it does not work nearly as well as a
[SPEAKER_02]: full plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would we think that it would work
in other areas as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the aim of this is to, I'm looking at
breast cancer in this case, and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be concentrating on the subtype
of HER2 positive in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, one in eight women will be
affected, impacted by breast cancer in
[SPEAKER_02]: their lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you get older, these risk factors
go up considerably.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, and we are an aging
population, so this is a considered
[SPEAKER_02]: problem moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: An estimate of the cost for this moving
forward are at the moment we're spending
[SPEAKER_02]: an excess of $15 billion a year treating
breast cancers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we move to 2020, and that's in
2010, so that's already outdated,
[SPEAKER_02]: and as we're now closer to 2020,
we're looking at an excess of $22 billion
[SPEAKER_02]: a year to extend the life, and a great
percentage of that's spent in the final
[SPEAKER_02]: year of life for a lot of these patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to do something about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been, right now, HER2 positive,
ER positive, PR positive, and then of
[SPEAKER_02]: course the triple negative are the three
major subtypes without getting into all
[SPEAKER_02]: the genetics and the anomalies of each of
those in their cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the targeted therapies for ER
and PR positives of tamoxifen,
[SPEAKER_02]: which many people choose to take as part
of their therapies.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the HER2 positive, RTK targeted,
which is, Lopatinib is pretty well the
[SPEAKER_02]: standard of care.
[SPEAKER_02]: In both cases, it's with or without
chemotherapy and or radiation,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on what your doctor has
recommended for you or your oncologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Triple negative, there are no targeted,
so chemotherapy is really the only option
[SPEAKER_02]: for these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're gonna look, first of all,
so what we did, as I'm going through the
[SPEAKER_02]: methodology right now, is we started out
with two compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one was a pure THC compound,
that was sourced from THC Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very typically used in a lot of
different research projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second was, and I still have
no idea how our extract got to Spain,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Aunt Zelda's extract from California,
we selected one that was not
[SPEAKER_02]: extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not pick the one that was like,
ooh, this is gonna have phenomenal
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We picked an average that we may use as a
starting point with a cancer patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we only remember in this study,
we're only really concerning ourselves
[SPEAKER_02]: with the THC, so I'm not showing you the
whole profile in the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: This actually happened to be one called
Purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The names don't even get me started.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was about 55% THC within this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's important is that we used the
same concentration dose in both in vivo
[SPEAKER_02]: and in vitro so that the differences in
will only be responsible based upon the
[SPEAKER_02]: pure compounds versus the full plant
extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these numbers, the first labs for Aunt
Zelda's were done by Sonoma Lab Works,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has been verified multiple times at
other labs for the accuracy of their
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, they were all,
both of these compounds were double
[SPEAKER_02]: checked through Kana Foundation in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is we started out,
of course, and I say we, I absolutely have
[SPEAKER_02]: no, that's a, not a real we, because I
didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was all done in Christina Sanchez,
Manuel Guzman's lab in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they did is they started out with
the cancer cells in Petri dish,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is pretty typical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were incubated with THC or the
vehicle, which in this case was sesame
[SPEAKER_02]: oil, or the THC extract for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were subjected to the MTT of
putting the yellow in what lights up
[SPEAKER_02]: what's still alive will be blue using
they're able to identify which cells are
[SPEAKER_02]: still alive and the viability,
the intensity of the blue tells them the
[SPEAKER_02]: viability and how many cells are alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was the first results we had on
the HER2 positive that we showed pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: clearly that the full plant extract at the
50% mark, which is really what's most
[SPEAKER_02]: significant here, we had far greater cell
death with the full plant extract than
[SPEAKER_02]: with the pure compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these are two different HER2
positive breast cancers with the BT474 and
[SPEAKER_02]: the HTC1954.
[SPEAKER_02]: To move forward on that, we then went
ahead and tested on the triple negative,
[SPEAKER_02]: because even though it was not initially
the focus of this, we know that we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: check all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are no other alternatives at the
moment for targeted therapies for this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's imperative that we find something
to help this group of sufferers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point, we also can show once
again that the THC extract is more potent
[SPEAKER_02]: than the THC pure compound in decreasing
triple negative breast cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it was time to move on to the
mouse models.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to even pretend to
understand exactly all of the things,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'll just explain the way it was
explained to me what was going on in the
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that these breast cancer cells,
in this case it was the BT474,
[SPEAKER_02]: were injected subcutaneously into the mice
that were immune deficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd been nude mice, is the term,
calls it in this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the tumors, actually they were
checked on a daily basis, and when the
[SPEAKER_02]: tumors achieved the 200 cubic millimeters,
then they were then ready to be treated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were divided randomly into seven,
there were seven in each group put into
[SPEAKER_02]: these four different, the vehicle once
again, the THC pure compound R extract,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then also with the lopatinib,
which as we mentioned before, is the RTK
[SPEAKER_02]: targeted therapy for this type of cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found was that, if you can
look, it's very, very clear here,
[SPEAKER_02]: excuse me, I went back a slide,
let me go back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very clear that the full plant
extract was far more effective in killing
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer cells than the pure, which was
really much more statistically the same as
[SPEAKER_02]: the vehicle in this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we moved on to then
comparing it to the lopatinib,
[SPEAKER_02]: once again, the lopatinib and the THC rich
extract performed almost statistically
[SPEAKER_02]: identically.
[SPEAKER_02]: In killing the cancer cells, which is
very, very promising to now see what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna do and run and see together
synergistically to see how they work in
[SPEAKER_02]: killing the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can get even a greater, similar to
what the same lab discovered years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: comparing TMZ with THC and finding that
each one worked very well on its own,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was a 50% increase in apoptosis
when they were combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are our next steps on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So next we will be comparing the THC
versus the THC rich, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously in the ER positive and the PR
positive breast cancer cell lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're then gonna do the same exact set of
experimentations with CBD pure and CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a huge amount of noise around CBD
and CBD pure compounds with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of salesman and marketing
going on around this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the evidence just is not showing that
using these pure compounds is giving
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere near the medical benefits that we
can achieve using full plant in any of
[SPEAKER_02]: these advised.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it's for the reasons that we
just don't know what we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're then gonna go ahead and compare
the different combinations of the major
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids and then including with that
also looking at some of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds that were within the plant,
seeing where we can add those in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be doing a combination of
cannabinoids with standard therapies to
[SPEAKER_02]: see where we find the best numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot of work to do and then
validating, of course, all the results
[SPEAKER_02]: from the in vitro into the in vivo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just very quick presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanna thank, obviously,
the hard heavy lifting in this study was
[SPEAKER_02]: done by Christina Sanchez and her team,
in particular, Sandra, who was doing all
[SPEAKER_02]: the gavage and doing the autopsies and
doing all the testing on it, which we're
[SPEAKER_02]: very, very pleased with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, our team at Aunt
Zelda's that has worked very hard over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years in creating these wonderful
compounds to help treat cancers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I beat the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so if anybody has any questions,
I'm more than happy to see if I can fake
[SPEAKER_02]: my way through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the pure THC extract, how was that
extracted?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have found from our experience working
with patients where we've actually done an
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment in the past where we took the
same plant, had it extracted with the same
[SPEAKER_02]: crop of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had it extracted with CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had it extracted with ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: We compared that same results on patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And patients did better on the ethanol
extract using the same than they did on
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, so that was an ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Comparing, though, the THC farm,
that was an extract that you were
[SPEAKER_05]: comparing?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a pure compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how was that extracted?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an isolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no idea the answer of that.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Short path distillation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife has stage four breast cancer,
metastasized to five tumors in her liver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I turned to you last year, and it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: She has no evidence of any cancer in her
body.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this comes from the experience of the
head of the breast oncology department at
[SPEAKER_03]: the University of Colorado who is
aggressively ignorant and aggressively
[SPEAKER_03]: opposed to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having said that, my question to you and
follow up to yesterday is, what now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to me about a maintenance dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maintenance dose is a very interesting
conundrum also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do love that word because it seems
so appropriate in this environment that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're in right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we've been doing with patients,
as a general rule, and like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: general rules are broken.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people on this side and this side
that we do different things with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the average patient, what we do,
especially when they respond as well as,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, your wife has without getting
into specifics because it's slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: different than this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to say what we usually do is after we
have two full cycles of NED, which usually
[SPEAKER_02]: is between six months and a year,
we'll start a titration down to about
[SPEAKER_02]: between 10%, 12%, statistically where it's
working out on a graph of what the highest
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutic dose was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we leave them at that maintenance dose
indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now when we have patients with quite a
few cancers, what we're doing is when we
[SPEAKER_02]: see that there's ID1 gene involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have told already that I have a
little bit of a girl crush on our next
[SPEAKER_02]: speaker because of his work with the ID1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've taken that forward and said,
OK, we're in a human laboratory in
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the lack of regulation,
we've been able to do a phenomenal amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of work with patients with their consent,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when the ID1 gene, we're able to,
and a lot of breast cancers have,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're able to flip that and have
relatively high levels of CBD in
[SPEAKER_02]: comparison to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have time for a few more
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative to typical therapy, which we all
know is very time consuming and exhausting
[SPEAKER_00]: and toxic, and its cost, can you comment
on the cost of this type of regime versus
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're typically seeing in medicine?
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I actually gave a
presentation a couple of years ago where I
[SPEAKER_02]: took some of the standard dosing protocols
that are out there on the internet and in
[SPEAKER_02]: mouse models and other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I extrapolated them forward and showed
on a chart what that would mean for human
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot take from mice what you would
give to a human.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having said that, though, what we have
found over our years of experience in
[SPEAKER_02]: working with the plant and working with
patients is that we've been able to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good idea of what the ratios of the
major cannabinoids, what the terpium
[SPEAKER_02]: profile to the best of our ability to
understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We test for about 33 terpenes right now,
I believe is the latest number.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're able to look at that and create
the regimen for the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, a lot of it is based upon the
individual comorbidities, other treatments
[SPEAKER_02]: going on with the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really just say what it would
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can tell you that a patient,
a woman probably age 45 with breast
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer, let's say she has her 2-positive
or breast cancer, she can expect to spend
[SPEAKER_02]: below $500 a month during her peak
treatment, maybe even a lot less than
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one patient, for example,
one breast cancer patient right now that
[SPEAKER_02]: came to us at stage four.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was really circling the drain,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she is able to successfully,
on 100 milligrams of CBD and 30 milligrams
[SPEAKER_02]: of THC, along with the other programs,
the terpium profile of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: she's able to have had an extreme
reduction in her tumor activity and is now
[SPEAKER_02]: living a pretty healthy life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say at that, if you look at the
cost, somewhere around 7 cents a
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram, 9 cents a milligram,
then you can just run the numbers yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but to your point, it's a very
inexpensive way to save your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a much more comfortable way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem is insurance doesn't
cover it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are populations that are usually
off of work because they're sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're the most at risk, even when
treating the children that might be on
[SPEAKER_02]: these higher doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nowadays, to try to live in California on
one income is almost unheard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mother or the father or somebody has
to stop working to address the child's
[SPEAKER_02]: needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right at the point when they're
financially most at risk is when they then
[SPEAKER_02]: have to take on treatments that are not
covered by insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a real problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mara, for the work you're doing
on the front lines helping patients and
[SPEAKER_04]: now on the back lines with the research.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a concept that's been spreading
through the medical cannabis world that
[SPEAKER_04]: THC is a bad thing for estrogen-sensitive
breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've looked through the literature to
try to find any evidence of this and
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't been able to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like your research also disputes
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if you could comment on this kind
of thought process and how it's been
[SPEAKER_04]: spreading and what you're seeing
clinically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that, first of all,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am another fan of yours, as you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have found that there's a lot of
rumors out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually what we can come back to is
they're either promulgated from the
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical industry or from the
naysayers or whomever is trying to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: people away from using cannabis is an
option.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we have found is you can keep the
THC levels pretty low in the breast
[SPEAKER_02]: cancers and do a lot more with the CBD and
get the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have not found that any of our
cancer patients have had increased tumor
[SPEAKER_02]: activity as a result of using THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had patients where it hasn't worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably because we don't know
enough about what the content of that
[SPEAKER_02]: actual medicine is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've never had a patient where it's
grown as a result of using the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen any examples of people
developing resistance, meaning recurrences
[SPEAKER_01]: while they're maintaining themselves on
maintenance doses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what happens is people get become
where they don't no longer having the
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutic effects depending on what the
effects are that they're going for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you are using the cannabis
therapeutically and you get to a
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutic dose, you do not have to feel
disassociative, you do not have to have
[SPEAKER_02]: the psychotropic effects necessarily,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're able to do an awful lot because you
titrate up to the point where you no
[SPEAKER_02]: longer are able to adjust to that dose and
then you know to back off a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: because you've exceeded your therapeutic
dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a person improves, their health
improves, the dose can go down because
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise that same dose will start making
them feel more psychotropic effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they may or may not be interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happens is over time,
you become where you're acclimated to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that we do about it
is we try to keep our medicines very
[SPEAKER_02]: similar in their profile for treating
different disease stats.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll change them up so that the
people are constantly having different
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines that they're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to that, after about every six
months, we suggest that they titrate down,
[SPEAKER_02]: they go down to nothing, they spend about
48 to 72 hours off of any cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: whatsoever and then start back up again
and find that they're able to once again
[SPEAKER_02]: increase and have their tolerance be much
lower and start having results again from
[SPEAKER_02]: the medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
