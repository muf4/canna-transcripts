[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've gotten a lot of great
feedback from the announcement of our
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed 23 Innovation and Investment
Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't already heard, CanMed 23 is
going to be bigger and better than any of
[SPEAKER_00]: our previous events in a few very
important ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, as you've noticed, the name is a
little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now the CanMed 23 Innovation and
Investment Summit, which highlights both
[SPEAKER_00]: the nature of breakthroughs being
presented at the event and the inclusion
[SPEAKER_00]: of principles to fund those efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, CanMed 23 will be held at the
Marriott Resort at Marco Island,
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will give attendees, like you,
the chance to fit in a little R&R at one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most beautiful vacation venues in
the world, with amenities like world-class
[SPEAKER_00]: golf, tennis, yoga, massages on the beach,
and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, the summit will feature immersive
workshops to bring you up to speed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: latest in capital markets, medical
training, and deep dives into cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: and laboratory technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although CanMed 23 will be different in
these ways, some things will remain the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will still feature world-class oral
presentations in the areas of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing curated by our CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: Advisory Board for impact and importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, our call for abstracts is open
now, and you can submit your abstract for
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration for a CanMed 23
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use the link in the show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also continue to share our
knowledge with the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_00]: through our CanMed Archive, social media
platforms, and, of course, the CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you can't join us in Marco
Island, you can still be part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed community.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you do want to join us at
CanMed 23, you can request your invitation
[SPEAKER_00]: now at canmedevents.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Dr. Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale is a plant scientist, a cannabis
lawyer, and a registered U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: patent attorney with over 20 years of
experience protecting plant varieties in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States and throughout the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale is the founder of Plant and Planet
Law Firm, an intellectual property law
[SPEAKER_00]: practice where he provides guidance and
expertise on patents and IP matters,
[SPEAKER_00]: and aids clients in establishing IP
protection for their legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars, products, and businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 2022, Dale participated in a
panel discussion titled, The Impacts of
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization on the Cannabis Legacy and
the Need for Solutions to Create a
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthier Industry, where he provided his
expertise with regards to how legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders can protect their IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our discussion, we cover the
different types of patents that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used to protect cannabis and hemp plants,
what plant patents cover, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: specific exemptions, how plant patents can
be challenged or invalidated, the panic
[SPEAKER_00]: that ensued after the Biotech Institute
began patenting cannabis plants in 2017,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how it affected the industry,
the biggest hurdles that prevent breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: from protecting their plants, and how
breeders can determine which plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: worth patenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Dale, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Breeders Best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders Best is the first company to
specialize in licensing patent-protected
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis genetics and the only company in
the cannabis space to exclusively serve
[SPEAKER_00]: independent cannabis breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Born from the desire to help independent
cannabis breeders become and or remain
[SPEAKER_00]: economically viable and not be left behind
in this rapidly changing industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders Best exists to bridge the gap
between independent cannabis breeders and
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketplace using a licensing model
proven in horticultural industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more, visit breedersbest.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Dale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm excited to talk with you about
this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking all about intellectual
property, patents, licensing, trademarks,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, patents and IP protection can apply
to really any aspect of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, from genetics to manufacturing
processes to the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could you explain which part of the
industry you specialize in and why you
[SPEAKER_00]: chose that to be your focus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we find to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came to intellectual property as a
plant scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I studied botany and plant genetics and
molecular and cellular biology before I
[SPEAKER_01]: went to law school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my career as a big law firm
attorney, I had an opportunity to work on
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of patents, biotech,
clean energy, sustainable technologies,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still do to some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the cannabis industry really
emerged and people started realizing that
[SPEAKER_01]: patents were obtainable for cannabis
genetics, that really seemed to be a sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: spot for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave a few talks and a few breeders,
I guess, found out that this is what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they came to me and asked me if I
could help them protect their cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has become a really large part,
more than half of my practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very exciting to see the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry has its ups and downs like
all industries do, but it's fun to
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can you explain the different types
of patents that can be applied to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: a breeder's IP?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk about patents and then I'll
talk about a patent equivalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope I don't forget to talk about
that because that's a very important thing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the US and abroad.
[SPEAKER_01]: In talking about patents, the one that
people always think of is something called
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plant patents are really for any kind
of plant that is asexually propagated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in cannabis, we refer to that as
cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think about grapevines,
and cherry trees, and all of those kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of things, those are all asexually
propagated organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant patent statute was really
created to fill a gap in the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: available coverage for creative work when
the plant breeding industry as an industry
[SPEAKER_01]: really started to take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was back in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the options with cannabis is to
get a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing about plant patents
is they are only infringed by asexual
[SPEAKER_01]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's suppose you've got a strain or a
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some difference of opinion about
the best term to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am pretty agnostic about that because I
think it's more about just communicating
[SPEAKER_01]: with where people are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's suppose you've got a cultivar
that is not easy to breed with and not
[SPEAKER_01]: very stable, but it's really special in
its clonal form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the real value is all about clonal
propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really the only thing anybody
would ever want to do with that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that case, a plant patent would fit
because it would provide the adequate
[SPEAKER_01]: coverage for something that's only really
clonally propagated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that's interesting about the
cannabis plant though is, as you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be propagated in scale,
either clonally or by seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things people might want to
do with a special cultivar is use it to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed some other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's important about a plant patent
is that it's not infringed by breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not infringed by making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you've got something that has
value for breeding or for producing seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant patent really wouldn't be enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd have to pursue a utility
patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And utility patent is the common kind of
patent that people use on jet engines and
[SPEAKER_01]: telecommunication devices and
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a way to make a utility patent
really fit a plant variety and make it not
[SPEAKER_01]: as complicated or difficult to obtain as a
typical utility patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is by defining the claims,
defining the invention with reference to a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific biological deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say this is our example with this
organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to get anything that's
broader than this organism or that's
[SPEAKER_01]: different, let's say different from this
organism, but we are trying to get some
[SPEAKER_01]: breadth around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to, we're going to make this
deposit and then we're going to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: we claim seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That correspond to seeds on this deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also claim using plants grown from
these seeds or progeny of those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: grown from these seeds for breeding or for
making products, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get a lot broader protection
than from a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why would anybody ever choose a plant
patent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's faster and it's cheaper than a
utility patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a utility patent that involves making
a deposit, which in my firm, we refer to
[SPEAKER_01]: that as a variety specific utility patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those cost about twice as much as a plant
patent and take a little longer usually to
[SPEAKER_01]: get, but they are, it's still very
consistently predictable that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: obtain those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to run into a whole lot
of barriers if you really did breed that
[SPEAKER_01]: and if it really is new and
distinguishable from other things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to the plant patent and it's
interesting that that asexual propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: is such an important piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say I purchase a patented cultivar and
I self it and create feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that, I do my own phenohunt
and then find a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually pretty similar to the
first one that I purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I in the clear there?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's only protected by a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you call me or you can look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's marked with a patent notice,
which patent goods are supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: marked with, then it will have a patent
number and it will either be a,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's see, an eight digit number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would look like something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would look like 10 comma, you know,
three digits, three digits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a utility patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has a number that starts with two
P's, it's PP and then usually five digits,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, so if it really is just a plant
patent and what you're doing is you're
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding with it and then you're doing a
phenohunt, those things, those activities
[SPEAKER_01]: would not infringe a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why even though it's rare that
we recommend plant patents, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done tons of plant patents in other
fruits and flowers, it's rare that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate protection for a really special
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I say, sometimes a cultivar isn't
very stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to make good seeds from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy to breed with for whatever
reason, but you just really love that
[SPEAKER_01]: exact clonal form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in which case plant patent would
be a perfect fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you did mention patent equivalents
and you didn't want to forget to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for remembering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw you taking notes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the U S is really unusual
in having three different ways of
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting a plant cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can certainly, as we've discussed,
you can protect it with a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can protect it with a utility patent
that involves a deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also protect it with something
provided through the USDA called the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: variety protection certificate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's, it's a form of intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a similar scope of,
it's an exclusionary right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning when you have the right to,
or when you have that grant of
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property, it gives you the
right to make other people stop doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something in court or stop, go to court to
make them stop doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it gives you a right to authorize them
with a license and collect royalties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a plant variety protection certificate
is, it's different from a patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is part of an international convention
called UPOG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the U S implementation of UPOG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And UPOG was created really as a patent
alternative because a lot of countries
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to have living organisms within
their patentable subject matter scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, they don't, they're off,
their patent offices don't like working
[SPEAKER_01]: with living organisms or have some other
public policy reason not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But recognizing the tremendous importance
of plant breeding and plant varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the world, there was this
international convention created.
[SPEAKER_01]: That established its own form of
intellectual property protection for plant
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are about 75 countries that
are members of UPOG, including the U S.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the U S joined UPOG, we did it by
passing the plant variety protection act
[SPEAKER_01]: and making the USDA, the administrator of
that, the administrative agency for that
[SPEAKER_01]: act.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the differences?
[SPEAKER_01]: The main difference is that, well,
there are a few differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one, right now at least, the,
since the USDA requires a seed deposit for
[SPEAKER_01]: a PVP application, the only, and they
receive the seed deposit themselves or
[SPEAKER_01]: some government agency proxy does,
they will only accept applications that
[SPEAKER_01]: qualify under federal, under the farm bill
as hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got to be 0.3% THC or less in the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's more than that, and you have to
describe things like the THC levels in the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower as part of the overall disclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and if it, if it doesn't qualify as
hemp, they won't accept the seed deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they don't have a real per se ban
on accepting marijuana applications or
[SPEAKER_01]: considering marijuana applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no mechanism to handle the
seed deposit requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we believe that this, this will
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changed really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the farm bill was passed,
the USDA very quickly adopted,
[SPEAKER_01]: it started accepting applications for hemp
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we believe that they'll do the very
same thing for marijuana as soon as that
[SPEAKER_01]: is federally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, and, and then the other important
thing about PVP's protection is that it
[SPEAKER_01]: has a couple of kind of public policy
carve outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not an infringement of a PVP
certificate for someone to breed with that
[SPEAKER_01]: variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's built into the statute
that that's okay to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if you want to, if you want to
have breeding be prohibited by,
[SPEAKER_01]: with your intellectual property rights,
you've got to do that with the utility
[SPEAKER_01]: patent because the PVP certificate and the
plant patent will not, will not prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other carve out, the other
kind of public policy right is that
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who obtains legitimately seeds of
a, of a PVP protected variety has a right
[SPEAKER_01]: to bulk out the, to make the same number
of seeds for the next, the next planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called the farmer's exemption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you buy the seeds once,
but then you can make your own seeds after
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can't make them to sell to third
parties, but you can make them to replant
[SPEAKER_01]: the same area, the same acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there are scenarios under
which a PVP certificate would make a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of sense and would be the right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first of all, it's got to be hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, you've got to be, you've got to
recognize the farmer's exemption and the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder's exemption and be okay with
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the one other little nuance to that,
which is that in the U S and I think in
[SPEAKER_01]: most UPUB countries, if you don't like
those exemptions, you can only license you
[SPEAKER_01]: can just have a policy that, well,
we don't license this to anyone and we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't give access to these seeds to anyone
who isn't willing to sign an agreement
[SPEAKER_01]: that they will not breed or that they will
not, they'll buy new seed from us every
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in most countries, it's okay to
contract out of those exemptions and to
[SPEAKER_01]: fill those gaps with a contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some countries are so committed to
that as a matter of public policy that
[SPEAKER_01]: they won't, they'll say any contract that
attempts to take away these exemptions is
[SPEAKER_01]: invalid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's country by country and it
changes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd want to get a lawyer that knows
this and works with it to check the
[SPEAKER_01]: countries of interest and see if you can
contract out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the IP, well, it's an IP,
it's a form of intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a patent equivalent, but not really a
patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really plant variety protection
throughout all the rest of the world is
[SPEAKER_01]: done through UPUB rather than through
patent offices with a couple of really
[SPEAKER_01]: minor exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so which type of IP protection do you
think is, or do you see as the most
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly used to protect cannabis
cultivars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, what's interesting is if
you watch the patent issuances over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last few years, you saw a lot of plant
patents issuing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is they do issue faster than other
patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people who just want to have a
patent for, you know, portfolio building
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes or bragging rights or something
might choose one like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think also a lot of people didn't
realize the weaknesses of a plant patent
[SPEAKER_01]: and how plant patent doesn't work very
well for, well, doesn't provide really
[SPEAKER_01]: full coverage for a plant like cannabis
that can be propagated both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it was a combination of all
those reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are seeing more of these variety
specific utility patents issuing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot more than I could count
off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot that are pending.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few plant patents that are
pending and somebody who has, for whom
[SPEAKER_01]: protection, quick and thorough protection
is a higher priority than saving money,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can certainly pursue both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can start with a plant patent,
get that issued quickly, have your clonal
[SPEAKER_01]: propagation protected, and then follow it
with a VSUP, a variety specific utility
[SPEAKER_01]: patent that ties back to the plant patent
filing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can have both kinds of
coverage, but now you're paying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, something like three X the cost
of the plant patent instead of one or the
[SPEAKER_01]: other, one X or two X, if that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you sort of mentioned monitoring
the different patents that have issued
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's funny about five years
ago when groups like biotech Institute
[SPEAKER_00]: began registering patents on cannabis
plants, there was a lot of panic in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry from people who thought that,
you know, they would maybe be sued for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing weed in their own backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is, what has become of those early
patents and have they been enforced or had
[SPEAKER_00]: any real impact on the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've had a big impact on the
industry, but maybe not the intended
[SPEAKER_01]: impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole way I got into the industry,
I was minding my business in my office in
[SPEAKER_01]: San Francisco, and I got an email from
somebody who was organizing something
[SPEAKER_01]: called the open cannabis project,
and they were all in a flutter over those
[SPEAKER_01]: biotech Institute patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought this is the beginning of the
end of this emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be dominated by overbroad
patents, and it's going to put a chilling
[SPEAKER_01]: effect on all the home growers and all the
home breeders and people are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did kind of freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they called me because they said,
well, we want somebody who really knows
[SPEAKER_01]: plant IP, we found you and would you be
willing to advise us?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's actually how I got into the
cannabis industry in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I'm glad that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a really interesting evolution
step in my career personally, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody did believe that there would be
this really overbearing, oppressive
[SPEAKER_01]: approach to patenting and patent
enforcement in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a few things that I think
limit that practically or perhaps legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll try to go into all that,
but before I forget, when I got involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in this and became so involved in the
industry and going to meetings and talking
[SPEAKER_01]: to people and giving talks and things,
I realized that there were a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: questions and not as many answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started a blog, it's at plantlaw
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It answers a lot of the really common
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, one of the posts is titled
because it was a question I got a million
[SPEAKER_01]: times at a meeting was, can Monsanto or
anybody else make me stop growing my own
[SPEAKER_01]: plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started answering these questions
in the blog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't blog as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get back to it, but I'd say the
posts that are there answered a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most common questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there was so much anxiety about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what has happened since then and why
did it not go the way that people who
[SPEAKER_01]: spent tons of money on those patents maybe
thought it would?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not, I can't read their mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what their motive was,
but these early patents, just to give some
[SPEAKER_01]: context for people who haven't seen them,
made the attempt to protect, to carve out
[SPEAKER_01]: some NIP position not based upon a
specific genetics like seeds on deposit or
[SPEAKER_01]: like one cultivar and its clonal progeny,
but it defined the patent scope,
[SPEAKER_01]: the patent right, more in terms of a
chemotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really any cannabis plant that
checks these boxes, a certain THC to CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio, a certain really general terpene
profile that really would cover a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why did that patent never get allowed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the way a patent examination process
works is the examiner, they're supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: find reasons to reject a patent claim,
but how do they find their reasons?
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a search of the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they look at prior patents and they
look at prior academic publications and
[SPEAKER_01]: anything they can get from say,
from the internet, trade journals or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is unique, absolutely unique about
the cannabis industry in comparison with
[SPEAKER_01]: other high value industries is that there
was a lot of prior commercial activity and
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of prior inventive activity,
but it was the opposite of published,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was hidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if an examiner needs to find a way
to reject a patent claim that is very
[SPEAKER_01]: broad, he or she has to go look at prior
patents and there weren't a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: prior academic publications, not a lot,
prior commercial activity or evidence of
[SPEAKER_01]: prior commercial activity, which was all
hidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the examiner may have done a great
job examining this, but did not have the
[SPEAKER_01]: tools to reject it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course now the community sees these
claims and say, hey, that's Jamaican lion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jamaican lion's been around for a lot
longer than when this patent was filed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the community starts to take its
collective memory and creates another kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of what you could call prior art.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the term that they use for
those things that the examiner finds in a
[SPEAKER_01]: search.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could say, this is prior art.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not published prior art,
but it is something that factually is out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and that people could verify.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is at least the line of reasoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't independently verified this
stuff, but so they say, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: in our community collective memory or in
the evidence that individual people could
[SPEAKER_01]: bring forward, this chemotype existed a
long time before this patent was filed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what does that do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it explains why the patent was
granted in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The examiner didn't know as much as was
actually out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not omniscient and they can only
do what they can do with searching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing that would have killed that
patent application perhaps was something
[SPEAKER_01]: that was factual, but not knowable by an
examiner.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you start enforcing a patent,
you identify a defendant and you sue them
[SPEAKER_01]: and you tell them, you've got to either
pay me some money or stop using my
[SPEAKER_01]: patented technology or both.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when it gets real, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody's highly motivated to dig
deeper and dig deeper than an examiner had
[SPEAKER_01]: time to do and use more resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, that process is
tremendously expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I was advocating
early on in my blogging was to form some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a community coalition that would a
little bit like NATO or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd all agree to defend whoever is the
one that gets poked by this first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd pull our resources and pull our
community knowledge to overcome an
[SPEAKER_01]: overbroad patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what's cool about this is to my
knowledge, those patents have never been
[SPEAKER_01]: asserted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really galvanized the community in a
way that I'm grateful for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there may be some real, I'm not saying
that the patents don't have any value or
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have any great business purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's knowledge that I don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any inside information on
that company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that company is not the
only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a patent attorney's job to
try to get the broadest claims they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm counseling a client,
I tell them, we want to get the broadest
[SPEAKER_01]: valid claims you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want you to have a patent that's
not going to be valid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just to close the loop on that,
if someone does assert a patent against me
[SPEAKER_01]: and I do have evidence that the patent
never should have been granted,
[SPEAKER_01]: what am I saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not saying that what I'm doing
doesn't fall within these claims,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would constitute infringement.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm saying is these claims never
should have been granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an invalid patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my defense is not my own activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that the patent office didn't grant
it a patent that never should have been
[SPEAKER_01]: granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting about that is if a
patent is invalidated in litigation,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the defendant can produce evidence
like that, it's gone forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you lose once on a validity challenge,
and you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that assumes that you've exhausted all
of your appeals and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be another reason that these
patents haven't been asserted yet is that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a risk of having them exposed as
being invalid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to hasten to say I'm not
providing legal advice or legal analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: on those patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I am doing is talking about what
the community has informed me of and
[SPEAKER_01]: combined with some general principles of
patent law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no legal advice or opinions here,
but just a summary of what's happened over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned that you help breeders
sort of apply for and acquire patents on
[SPEAKER_00]: their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever represent growers on the other
side where maybe they are being sued for
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially using patented material,
and as you described, maybe defending or
[SPEAKER_00]: invalidating that patent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do is something that comes a little
bit before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patent litigation is so tremendously
expensive that there's a lot of kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: paper shuffling and foot stomping and
maybe saber rattling that happens before a
[SPEAKER_01]: lawsuit is filed in many cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody will get a letter and the
letter will say something like,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you're not aware, but we have a
patent that has this scope, and you might
[SPEAKER_01]: be operating within that patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like you to take a look at that,
and we're open to license discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really gentle kind of nod
towards a cease and desist letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason those are usually so gentle
is if you come on really strong and say
[SPEAKER_01]: you're infringing our patent and we're
going to sue you, that can create
[SPEAKER_01]: something called declaratory judgment
jurisdiction, which will let the party
[SPEAKER_01]: that just got that nasty letter sue you
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they got the money to do this,
they can say, oh, we got this letter,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're taking you to court for a
declaratory judgment that your patent is
[SPEAKER_01]: invalid or that we don't infringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that shifts the balance of power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some really good reason not to
write overly aggressive, overly explicit
[SPEAKER_01]: initial letters like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you usually just try to make someone
aware that they've got a risk without
[SPEAKER_01]: creating declaratory judgment
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a client gets a letter like that,
and it's usually not about plant genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's usually about some manufacturing
technique or some composition or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I work with all of those different
subject matters in cannabis and across a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a letter like that and they come
to me and they say, let's take a look at
[SPEAKER_01]: this and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they say, help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I say, let's take a look at that
patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about what you're actually
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's interpret these patent claims in
view of not just what they say,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in view of the supporting application
that was filed and in view of the
[SPEAKER_01]: arguments that they made to the patent
office to get it allowed in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this whole analysis is called a
freedom to operate analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually writing a series of blog
posts about FTO that I'm hoping to drop
[SPEAKER_01]: later this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that happens, the first thing you
do is you look at the patent claims
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves and the claims are the part of
the patent that defines the legal right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It defines the invention and you compare
that with what the accused party is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can find even one thing that
that claim requires that your client or
[SPEAKER_01]: whoever is not doing, then that's what
people refer to that in a shorthand called
[SPEAKER_01]: the missing element rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's something that the claim
requires that you're clearly not doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you just don't infringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not always black and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's pretty hard to figure that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's say that right now you do
infringe every view.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have every one of the elements of that
claim, but there's a design change that
[SPEAKER_01]: you could make in one little feature that
would make it so that there's now a
[SPEAKER_01]: missing element.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you make a design modification.
[SPEAKER_01]: You write back and say, you know,
our current product doesn't seem to have
[SPEAKER_01]: everything this patent requires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So respectfully, see you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes a client will just come
to me with knowing that one of their
[SPEAKER_01]: competitors is doing a lot of patenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll say, hey, can we keep an eye
on these guys, keep an eye on the claims
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're issuing and let's do a
checkup every once in a while and make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that we're not stepping on their toes
or that we're not facing any risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, boards of directors and
investors love it when you're that
[SPEAKER_01]: careful, as long as it's not too expensive
to be that careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a really good balance between,
you know, kind of keeping your nose clean
[SPEAKER_01]: as a company and making sure that you're
not infringing patents and that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of the ones that you need to be
watching out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And occasionally, you know, altering your
activities to redesigning your products or
[SPEAKER_01]: your methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to circle back to the question really
about plant genetics, usually because as
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said, these kinds of patents,
like a plant patent only infringed by
[SPEAKER_01]: actual cloning of the exact same variety,
a variety specific utility patent only
[SPEAKER_01]: infringed by really starting with the same
genetics and doing something with it
[SPEAKER_01]: that's within the scope of those claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really rare to actually accidentally
infringe something like that and not even
[SPEAKER_01]: know that you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you received something from someone
else and you're working with it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you find out late in the process that it
was covered by a patent and you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe you did, in good faith,
infringe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well then, smartest thing to do is stop
doing it and move on to something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really rare that these things
have to be litigated because if someone
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't using the same genetics,
it's a pretty straightforward DNA test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys certainly know those things
in medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty straightforward DNA test to do
a comparison and say, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: these might look superficially similar
phenotypically, but they're not the same
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got all these differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then anybody who has that patent would
be crazy to continue to pursue the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd just be throwing money away down a
hole because the evidence would end up
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrating that it's not an
infringement.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, if there is a great
match, either an identical match or a
[SPEAKER_01]: match that shows that this accused plant
definitely descended from this patented
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, then depending exactly on the scope
of that patent right, it may be a clear
[SPEAKER_01]: infringement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason these things don't get
litigated is because the evidence is
[SPEAKER_01]: usually so clear one way or the other that
there's going to be a settlement way
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier in the process without spending
all the money on discovery and a trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you brought up genotype, which was
great because I was over genotyping,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say, which is great because I was
going to ask you about that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that's probably not a
requirement for a patent application,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I imagine it's pretty valuable,
especially if you're having a plant patent
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going to be asexually propagated,
because then, like you said, you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is some great evidence to show that
it's exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting is the plant patent
statute says that you have to disclose as
[SPEAKER_01]: much about the variety as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't require you to do a DNA test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always tell people, if you've got DNA
information, even just a few markers,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you've got a whole genotype or
whatever, go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's include that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not required.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten lots and lots of plant patents
and variety specific utility patents
[SPEAKER_01]: without submitting DNA information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if you've got it, and a lot of
things originate from it, you do a DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: test and you say, oh, this looks pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you end up deciding, this might
be interesting enough that I should patent
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by then, you've already got the DNA
information in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should include it in the application.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not required.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always tell people, look,
if you've got it, use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're curious and you can afford the
test, go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great information.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have the DNA test right now,
well, you'll certainly want to get it if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an infringement, or if you're
accused of infringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cool thing about DNA is it doesn't
really change.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a clonally propagated
organism, it's going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use it when the evidence is,
you can go get the test when the evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you say are the most common
hurdles preventing breeders or growers
[SPEAKER_00]: from protecting their IP?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the early blog posts I did was
the question was, how can I know if my
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is unique or different enough for
patenting?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is, if you bred it and
selected it and you can identify how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: different from its parents, it's already
unique enough for patenting or new enough
[SPEAKER_01]: for patenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really not the challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is deciding which things are
worth patenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you commit to patenting a cultivar,
you're going to be spending five figures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to spend at least 10 to 15 to
get a plant patent, and probably 25 to 30
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a variety specific utility patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can vary a little bit, but it's not
going to vary a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're making a pretty big
commitment there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that you've got something that's
going to be the flavor of the month a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years from now, and then it'll
fade away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not worth patenting, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, you've got something
that might be licensed worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the next huge thing that everybody
wants to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it'd be foolish not to spend 30,
50, 100, whatever it took to protect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would just be a rounding error on all
of the value that that thing creates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is there are certain
deadlines within which you need to file a
[SPEAKER_01]: patent application, and it's usually
before you know if you've got a major home
[SPEAKER_01]: run or the flavor of the month.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I talk to clients about this is I
say, do you think that this is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing in value and demand in five
years, or will it have already kind of run
[SPEAKER_01]: its course?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not an easily knowable
question, but they'll know it better than
[SPEAKER_01]: I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they believe that it's going to be
increasing in demand in five years and 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years, then patenting is really kind of a
no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they think that it will already be kind
of assay or less interesting in three or
[SPEAKER_01]: four years, then by the time they got a
patent, nobody would be infringing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, it turns into a business decision
more than a legal decision, if that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense, legal or technical question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned deadlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this might be a basic question,
but are you only able to apply for a
[SPEAKER_00]: patent before you've actually sold it or
commercialized it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the U.S., you can apply up to a year
after the first public disclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what's interesting about that is,
and this might seem quite surprising,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was kind of surprising to me,
is that let's say you want a plant patent,
[SPEAKER_01]: then what constitutes a public disclosure
is public availability of that exact
[SPEAKER_01]: genotype in clone form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people have had some really
special genetics that they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: propagating and growing themselves and
selling flour, but they've never sold any
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've never sold any clones,
you don't have a deadline yet for plant
[SPEAKER_01]: patenting, even if you've been selling
flour for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran this scenario past one of the senior
examiners at the patent office,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I said, let's suppose somebody's had
a, they've been clonally propagating and
[SPEAKER_01]: selling flour for 30 years, but nobody's
ever, nobody of them has ever had access
[SPEAKER_01]: to a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, yeah, that's still patentable as
a plant patent, because the thing that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are saying is new is that living plant in
clone form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that still hasn't been out there,
even though the flour has been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's suppose you want a VSUP,
a variety-specific utility patent,
[SPEAKER_01]: then anything that has been out there to
the public for more than a year is not
[SPEAKER_01]: eligible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say seeds have never been out
there, the public hasn't been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed with it, the clone form hasn't been
out there, but flour's been out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: flour and extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you just have to be careful not to
claim flour or extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still claim the seeds,
you can still claim the breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can claim anything that hasn't been
publicly available, but prior sale of
[SPEAKER_01]: flour or extracts may make it that that's
not part of what you could claim at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just to, there are no short
answers when you ask me a question,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when you go to the PVP system,
the PVP and UPOP system, the deadlines are
[SPEAKER_01]: quite different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're defined based on commercial
exploitation of a variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that term has a slightly different
definition in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, you have to dig in and
ask yourself, what is the level of
[SPEAKER_01]: activity that constitutes exploitation of
the variety in this country?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when did that start?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's further complicated by the
fact that for cannabis under UPOP,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd have two deadlines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have, one deadline would be,
you have to file within a year of local
[SPEAKER_01]: exploitation and within four years of the
first exploitation anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say I start selling flour,
which would, I think would almost
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly be considered commercial
exploitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start selling flour this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a hard four-year deadline for
anywhere in the world to get my UPOP
[SPEAKER_01]: application filed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a hard one-year deadline for
the country where I've been selling,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I've been doing anything commercial
with that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes just licensing a plant into a
country and authorizing someone to start
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating it may or may not cross the
threshold of commercial exploitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really got to dig down and
understand the rules in the countries
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're interested in protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're expecting, as that four-year
deadline approaches, we're expecting to be
[SPEAKER_01]: filing a lot more applications in foreign
countries under that kind of deadline
[SPEAKER_01]: regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winding down here, a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like there's an aversion to
patent and IP protection in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder community in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, going back to when those
first ones issued, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people on social media or grandstanding
that this is a community plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't be patenting it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has that changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: People more agreeable to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a widely varying opinion about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I respect that this is really a values
thing for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's community standards and values and
principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would never want to talk anybody out
of their values or their deeply held
[SPEAKER_01]: principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would like to give them
opportunities to think differently,
[SPEAKER_01]: just in case they're interested in
examining the question from another point
[SPEAKER_01]: of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the posts that I wrote on my
blog is it's titled something like Lessons
[SPEAKER_01]: from Tom Terrific on Good Fences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this actually makes reference to a
controversy that happened with Tom Brady
[SPEAKER_01]: and trademarking the term Tom Terrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I go into too much detail,
it will take too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, look at that blog and
you'll see that it's really about whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it goes to questions of whether it's right
to own land, whether it is ever right to
[SPEAKER_01]: have any ownership rights on something as
natural and sacred as a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the point that I make is you may think
it's not, but let's suppose that,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, when you get an intellectual
property, you're still allowed to let
[SPEAKER_01]: other people use your IP, but you have the
choice of keeping some people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like building a fence around your
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can let people through if you want,
but you also have the right to keep people
[SPEAKER_01]: off your property if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one angle on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other angle I sometimes I talk about
the ethics of patenting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the angle on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a plant reader, your life,
your life's work is creative work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been creating something special
that people benefit from and that somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: might make a lot of money on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unlike somebody who writes a song or
writes a book or makes a movie,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have any automatic protection in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and almost the entire world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's automatic copyright protection for
those kinds of creative works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like songs and books and movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as it's created, you don't even
have to register anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get stronger rights by
registration, but you've got automatic
[SPEAKER_01]: copyright from the moment it's created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that doesn't exist for
plant varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got these other creative people,
these plant breeders, who very much like
[SPEAKER_01]: an author or a photographer or whatever,
they have this great creative work that
[SPEAKER_01]: has tremendous value.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they don't protect it, they don't
get paid the same way somebody can who
[SPEAKER_01]: just creates different kinds of work that
has copyright protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you if you look at it that way,
you might say, all right, maybe I wish
[SPEAKER_01]: patents weren't the way to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I don't really like patents,
especially the ones that can be abused.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a way for somebody to protect their
life's work and to get some value out of
[SPEAKER_01]: their life's work and have it be their
living instead of just a hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who's rich enough to I don't
know very many people in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that are independently wealthy
and can just breed for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them need to find a way to pay
their bills from their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so patenting or other kinds of
intellectual property protection just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of level the playing field with copyrights
and other kinds of creative work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that plant breeders are every
bit as worthy of getting paid as authors
[SPEAKER_01]: and sculptors and fine artists and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to me, the intellectual property
protection just helps them get paid for
[SPEAKER_01]: their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a great place to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I let you go, I want to give
you a chance to plug any social media or
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you mentioned the blog a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely put a link to that in the
show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anything else that people can can look
at to learn more or maybe get in touch
[SPEAKER_00]: with you?

Firm.

[SPEAKER_01]: special cultivars.

people in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we love helping people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if anybody has questions or or can
think of some way we could help them with
