[SPEAKER_01]: All cannabinoids have different points of
aerosolization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have CBN, for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have CBN in a vape, they're usually
using gummies to help with sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're using vapes in a regular
cartridge, usually when you're done with
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% of your cartridge, the CBN is
completely gone, completely degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another effect that we've seen with most
of the cartridges on the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: because obviously we don't test just our
own, is the fact that THCA, various other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, actually increase in
availability in the vapor throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: lifespan of the cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those are basically the only ones
left at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpenes have a lower boiling point,
and when you're using a live resin at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the cartridge, you're not gonna get
a lot of that flavor, you're really just
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna get the high that's left in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said that CBN, when the cart is at
basically 50%, it's all gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the majority of the carts that we've
tested, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no consistency in the delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mind you, it's not only because of bad
product, it's also because as an industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: we just haven't done a lot of research we
don't have a lot of information on how to
[SPEAKER_01]: better preserve these cannabinoids and
these turpenes and these flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we are able to provide a consistent
delivery throughout the entire experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of the cannabinoids that you've tested,
which one is sort of the most consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the life of a cart?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say THC and CBD are the most
consistent, but the answer is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: skewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big caveat here is that those are the
two primary cannabinoids that are the most
[SPEAKER_01]: used.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think as the industry progresses and
as the research progresses, we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to find more cannabinoids that can
basically provide, I would say the same
[SPEAKER_01]: effects, but also be more consistent in
the delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and so will that have to do with
kind of tweaking temperatures and
[SPEAKER_00]: different things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really about the extraction
techniques, the ratios, you know we hear a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot about the entourage effect,
but what we don't hear a lot about is the
[SPEAKER_01]: entourage effect of different cannabinoids
with different turpenes also modifies the
[SPEAKER_01]: physical properties of the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can make it less viscous, more viscous,
and that has an influence on the vapor
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes out.
I think that's a good point to make.
