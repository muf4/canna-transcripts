[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Yvonne, and I'm a senior
scientist with Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let me out of the lab this week to
come and speak to you guys about some data
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've collected over the past several
years, showing how culture-based cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial testing can put the consumer at
risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a brief history of the
past 350 years in micro and molecular bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all started back in 1767, when Van
Leeuwenhoek started the study of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Julius Petrie invented the Petrie dish in
1887, and in 1953, we all know Watson and
[SPEAKER_01]: Crick, with the help of Rosalind Franklin,
discovered the structure of DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: The field of molecular biology was
revolutionized in 1983 with Carey Mullis's
[SPEAKER_01]: invention of the polymerase chain
reaction, or as we like to call it,
[SPEAKER_01]: PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2003, the Human Genome Project was
completed after a 13-year endeavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molecular biology has come a long way in a
short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we can sequence the human genome in
36 hours compared to the 13 years it took
[SPEAKER_01]: almost 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet, in a world of microbiology,
we're still relying on a technique that's
[SPEAKER_01]: 161 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are some examples of your
traditional culture-based methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got plating, gram staining,
microscopy, and biochemical testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their advantages and
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantages are they're cheap,
they're sensitive, you can get down to
[SPEAKER_01]: single copy, single colony-forming units,
sorry, and they're reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Disadvantages are they're time-consuming,
can take days to grow the cultures,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what you're growing,
labor-intensive, multiple dilutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple plates, different incubation
times, and not all microorganisms grow on
[SPEAKER_01]: or in artificial media, and that's an
important point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Culture-based testing on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, there's three major players in
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: 3M PetriFilms, Hardy Diagnostic Plates,
and the BioMeriU Tempo cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these three companies have all crossed
over from the food industry into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, unlike food testing, cannabis
testing has to consider various routes of
[SPEAKER_01]: administration beyond just oral
consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis flower produces high
concentrations of antimicrobials,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, terpenoids, and thus
represent a different matrix than
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of these have been validated on a
cannabis matrix, which according to
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple regulatory bodies, you have to do
a new validation once you change your
[SPEAKER_01]: matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the molecular world for microbial-based
testing, you have hybridization,
[SPEAKER_01]: PCR, sequencing, and DNA microarray.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cannabis space, molecular methods
being used are QPCR and microarray,
[SPEAKER_01]: and sometimes sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We at Medicinal Genomics focus on QPCR in
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the advantages?
[SPEAKER_01]: Advantages of QPCR overplating is that
they're faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can obtain results in hours as opposed
to days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria can take anywhere between 24 and
48 hours to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeast and mold, 48 to 72 hours to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: QPCR is more accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the primers don't bind to the sequence
that you're looking at, the assay is not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So QPCR is looking for specific DNA
sequences shared by a family of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the DNA isn't present, QPCR isn't going
to detect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: QPCR is more specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the DNA sequence you're looking for
isn't there, QPCR, I'm sorry, if the DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: sequence is known, an assay can be
designed to target that species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specific DNA, this is important,
especially, oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important in the case of
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many species of aspergillus,
yet there are only four pathogenic species
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are aspergillus flavus,
fumigatus, niger, and terrius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And QPCR is scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's done in a 96-well plate
format, and this allows for automation to
[SPEAKER_01]: be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is a unique matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have flour, extracts and concentrates,
and MIPS, which are marijuana-infused
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lipid-rich matrices like flour,
oil, concentrate, and MIPS cannot be
[SPEAKER_01]: sampled with a simple aqueous immersion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, the lipids need to be dissolved
in water to fully get an idea of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: This usually requires a detergent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't good for culture-based
methods, because the detergent can also
[SPEAKER_01]: break down the cell wall of the
microorganisms that you're looking at,
[SPEAKER_01]: and therefore render them not viable to be
growing on your media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while these quick aqueous preps are
good for quick turnaround time and not
[SPEAKER_01]: having to extract DNA, they really put you
in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add a disadvantage of sampling what
you're truly looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some other people before me have
talked about how the cannabis matrix is
[SPEAKER_01]: very hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the current state regulations
in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an ever-changing map,
and it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: choose-your-own-adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many states will reference the USP or the
AHP, the main difference between these two
[SPEAKER_01]: is that the USP calls for the detection of
Pseudomonas in staff, while the AHP does
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some states choose to look for pathogenic
stack E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, while others are just looking at E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got the BCC in California,
the Bureau of Cannabis Control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually did some research before
coming out with their recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have species-specific lists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just looking at the organisms
that actually are harmful and pathogenic
[SPEAKER_01]: to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they focus on Pseudomonas,
stack E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, and the four species of Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some other states have picked up on
those regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alaska, Nevada, while they do have total
counts, they also now have Aspergillus
[SPEAKER_01]: species-specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Florida and Vermont are looking into
going with those regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what makes the AHP and the USP
regulations difficult in cannabis testing
[SPEAKER_01]: is that they all call for total tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And total yeast and mold and total aerobic
tests are unable to differentiate between
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogenic, beneficial, and benign yeast,
molds, and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this makes them poor indicators of
safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: A low total result doesn't mean that your
sample is harmful to consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a high total count, I'm sorry,
that's not, a low total result does not
[SPEAKER_01]: mean a sample is free of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a high total count doesn't mean that a
sample is harmful to consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said earlier, cannabis is a very
unique matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you cannot simply slap on a food
regulation and expect everything to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I've got some data to support some
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a biotolerant
gram-negative bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the USP, there is,
quote, no strict definition of this group
[SPEAKER_01]: of microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they grow operationally as those
microorganisms that show growth in the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard conditions on violet,
red, blue glucose agar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible
for 11% to 14% of hospital-acquired
[SPEAKER_01]: infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want your immunocompromised
cannabis patient getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set out to look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We obtained two different species from
ATCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grew them according to the 3M
PetriFilm product literature at 24 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: at 32C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And according to their literature,
Pseudomonas should appear as red colonies
[SPEAKER_01]: without gas or acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, there's no growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took that 1 to 100 dilution after 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tested it on our QPCR assays,
our three QPCR assays that can detect
[SPEAKER_01]: Pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, we were able to detect
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Pseudomonas is a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet through sequencing studies we've
performed with third-party testing labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see it popping hot on total yeast and
mold tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, this cartridge, you can see the yellow
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a low growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Pseudomonas growing in a Tempo
BioMeriU yeast and mold cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the Tempo platform utilizes a
pH-sensitive fluorescent dye to monitor
[SPEAKER_01]: the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the pH decreases, the fluorescence
results also decrease, indicating that the
[SPEAKER_01]: organism is growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a false positive result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because Pseudomonas is an
acid-producing bacteria, much like
[SPEAKER_01]: bacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to test this theory, we obtained a
culture from ATCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grew it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually a
chloramphenicol-resistant Pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grew it up in the presence of
chloramphenicol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we shipped it off to two third-party
testing labs in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an example of a report we got
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, it failed total
aerobic, as it should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pseudomonas is a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also failed the total yeast and mold
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shouldn't have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It passed the biotolerant gram-negative
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pseudomonas is biotolerant gram-negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is putting your consumers
at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting a false positive on
something that shouldn't be growing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get a false negative for a
biotolerant gram-negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biotolerant gram-negative is the type of
bacteria that you don't want growing on
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done some extensive studies with
several different customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is part of our paper that we did
with a third-party testing lab in
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did some sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did sequencing of the flower before
it was exposed to culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we scraped the colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened up the bio-meru cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we extracted the DNA after culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some examples of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did some real sequencing results
off of total yeast and mold tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, the blue line up top,
that's our friend pseudomonas growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then down the bottom, bacillus,
again, another acid-producing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bacterias are growing in yeast and
mold cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another little blip down
there, and that's botulitum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that you definitely don't
want on your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we think that's growing due to the
fact that these cartridges are more in an
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobic-type state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we did this sequencing,
we were targeting the 16S region of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the same with the yeast and mold
that was growing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the yeast and mold assay that we have,
we were targeting the ITS region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you can see that what the DNA
is before, the gray bars, is much
[SPEAKER_01]: different than what you're seeing after
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you're seeing, before culture,
there's a high level of penicillium.
[SPEAKER_01]: After culture, there's high levels of
trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichoderma are widely used in the
agricultural industry as fungicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's happening here is the
trichoderma is eating the penicillium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're seeing a different result after
culture, and it's not what was on there
[SPEAKER_01]: beforehand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Penicillium is also, you don't want that
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not what we're looking at here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspergillus is the one thing that has
caused a death in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not growing after culture,
and that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's more evidence for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspergillus grows as heterogeneous macro
colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a fancy word for it grows in
these clumps, clumps of canidia that can
[SPEAKER_01]: be hundreds to thousands of filamentaceous
growth packing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of it forming nice single
colonies, like you're used to seeing on a
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial plate, they grow in these
hamburger-type clumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you look at this, and you could count,
OK, that one, maybe there's three growing
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when actuality, it's probably about
three times as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get a sampling bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is growing at the 1 to 100
dilution on the 3M petri films,
[SPEAKER_01]: but on the stabbed out dex agar plates,
there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clumping causes a sampling bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see this in our QPCR results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we obtained 11 different yeast and
molds from ATCC, and we compared QPCR
[SPEAKER_01]: versus plating methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for 9 of the 11 organisms,
they match up really well, except for
[SPEAKER_01]: these two, aspergillus japonicus and
aspergillus flavus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're threefold off compared to what
the QPCR results are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is because aspergillus clumps,
and it creates a sampling bias during
[SPEAKER_01]: plating and effectively limits the dynamic
range of the assay in complicating the CFU
[SPEAKER_01]: program accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a reason why QPCR is better
able to detect aspergillus compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's some more data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is us testing MIPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli was grown up and spiked in the
presence of candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see the top is E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and TSB, which is our control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bottom is TSB, candy, and E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: So according to 3M, total aerobic plate
count provides total aerobic count after
[SPEAKER_01]: 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look after 48 hours,
I really wish this would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not until 96 hours that the E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and candy start showing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, again, after 48 hours,
you would say, oh, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: present.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll pass this.
[SPEAKER_01]: See it again in the coliform plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the 48-hour time point, you can see
without the presence of candy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the presence of candy, there's
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a great picture because this
shows the importance of DNA and how it can
[SPEAKER_01]: be used in differentiating different
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got your Monarch butterfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes through a huge state of
metamorphosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the same genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two organisms look completely
different, but they have the same genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The different genomes, those are four
different species of aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only one of them is pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only one of them is harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your passing limit for a total yeast
and mold test is 10,000 CFUs and 5,000 of
[SPEAKER_01]: them are aspergillus niger, the consumer
is at a much greater risk with a passing
[SPEAKER_01]: total yeast and mold result than with a
result indicating failure in a
[SPEAKER_01]: species-specific assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm running out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of my key points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because culture-based methods can grow off
targets, this leads to inflated counts
[SPEAKER_01]: that leads to higher failure rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Culture-based methods distort what is
actually present on the plant and other
[SPEAKER_01]: matrices and therefore provides an
accurate picture of microbial risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molecular-based methods can capture
specific microbial risks, while many of
[SPEAKER_01]: these risks fail to be detected by
culture-based methods due to their slow
[SPEAKER_01]: growth in these mediums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the complexity of different cannabis
matrices affect the readout chemistry and
[SPEAKER_01]: commonly used culture methods and
therefore given an inaccurate count of the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential threats present.
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Acknowledgements and thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be available for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do one quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent presentation and important data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering because outside of the
immunosuppressed, I suspect the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: risk to consumers is mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than aspergillus infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you comment if you've looked into
that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we currently are not doing any
mycotoxin testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know that most of the states require
some sort of mycotoxin testing and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: being done more at the chemistry level
than at the molecular level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
