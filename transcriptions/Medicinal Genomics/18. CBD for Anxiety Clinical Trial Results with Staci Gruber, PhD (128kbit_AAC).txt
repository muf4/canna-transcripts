[SPEAKER_00]: In other news, we've started a Facebook
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each year, we are consistently blown away
by the amazing presentations, inspiring
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations, and important connections
that are made at the annual CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to keep the conversations
flowing online with our CanMed Community
[SPEAKER_00]: Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CanMed Community is our virtual forum
allowing you to interact directly with
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the CanMed Conference speakers,
past attendees, and other group members to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss all things cannabis from bench to
the bedside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the link in the show description to
visit that group today and join.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this episode is Dr. Stacy
Gruber.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the Director of Cognitive and
Clinical Neuroimaging Care at McLean
[SPEAKER_00]: Hospital's Brain Imaging Center and an
Associate Professor of Psychiatry at
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvard Medical School.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Gruber has spent decades investigating
how both recreational and medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: use affects the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2014, Dr. Gruber launched MIND,
which stands for Marijuana Investigations
[SPEAKER_00]: for Neuroscientific Discovery,
the first ever program of its kind
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to clarify the specific effects
of medical cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: What she and her team have found is that
not only do medical cannabis patients tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to perform better on cognitive tests when
compared to recreational users,
[SPEAKER_00]: but medical cannabis patients tend to
outperform themselves when compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: tests administered before they started
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stacy and I explore why this may be the
case in our conversation, and we also
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss some results from MIND's
double-blind placebo-controlled CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trial for anxiety, which uses a
high CBD whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spoiler alert, the cognitive performance
data is pretty consistent with the team's
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other interesting observations from the
study include patients using whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: extract tend to use smaller doses than
single compound therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you would expect, this led us to
discuss the entourage effect and the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of using full spectrum products.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it was interesting that some
patients in the trial still tested
[SPEAKER_00]: positive for THC despite the fact that the
hemp-derived extract contained less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3 milligrams per ml of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good stuff in this conversation,
but first I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Healer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healer is a trusted, physician-developed
medical cannabis brand founded to address
[SPEAKER_00]: the challenges of helping patients and
health providers get the best results with
[SPEAKER_00]: safe, reliably dosable products and
education on how to use them best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healer's distinctive product formulations
and educational material are based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: work of leading cannabis clinician,
Dr. Dustin Sulak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sulak's Healer Hemp CBD and CBD-A
products are available nationwide and are
[SPEAKER_00]: accompanied with a step-by-step usage
guide and response tracker.

[SPEAKER_00]: And it wouldn't be the CANMED Coffee Talk
podcast without some good coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, we always turn to the hemp
and coffee exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know, hemp coffee is a
healthy, delicious, natural product rich
[SPEAKER_00]: in trace minerals and nutrients,

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stacy Gruber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Stacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I want to thank you not only
for joining us on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for being a two-time CANMED presenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that in 2019, we were thrilled to
have you as a keynote presenter where you
[SPEAKER_00]: shared the data that you and your team
have collected about how cannabis affects
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive function, which is quite
extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for listeners who might not be too
familiar with you or the work that your
[SPEAKER_00]: team is doing, I was just thinking that a
great place to start would be for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill them in on the work that you've been
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, I'm a huge fan of
CANMED.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually think I've been three
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an extraordinary conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is probably the very best of
its kind that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am very fond of telling people that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just by way of, I think, a little bit
of background, I've spent decades actually
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the impact of recreational
cannabis use on things like cognitive
[SPEAKER_01]: performance, clinical state, measures of
brain structure and function, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a particular focus on what we call
the vulnerable brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens to individuals who may
begin using cannabis regularly while their
[SPEAKER_01]: brain is still developing, or as I like to
call it, half-baked?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those studies from our lab and from
colleagues across the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really, in fact, the globe,
demonstrate that there appear to be some
[SPEAKER_01]: differences in those who begin using
cannabis regularly, especially with regard
[SPEAKER_01]: to, again, some of these cognitive
measures, especially those mediated by the
[SPEAKER_01]: frontal part of the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's the recreational story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to hold for, again,
early onset regular cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a relationship between earlier
onset, higher magnitude, that is higher
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of use, and higher frequency of
use, and maybe not doing quite as well on
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these measures as other folks who
use regularly starting later when their
[SPEAKER_01]: brains are more fully developed,
or who start when they're in their 40s or
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the recreational story that we've
spent a lot of time looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was very surprised when I looked in
the literature since medical cannabis was
[SPEAKER_01]: first legalized in the States in 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't find much with regard to the
impact of medical cannabis use and the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential impact of that type of cannabis
use on measures of, again, cognitive
[SPEAKER_01]: performance, clinical state, quality of
life, sleep, conventional medication use,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, despite the fact that it's been
around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started a program called MIND,
Marijuana Investigations for
[SPEAKER_01]: Neuroscientific Discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really should have cannabis in the
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But states have medical marijuana laws,
so we stuck with MIND.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that program is really dedicated
specifically to looking at the potential
[SPEAKER_01]: impact of medical cannabis use on all of
those domains I mentioned and others,
[SPEAKER_01]: using lots of different approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So longitudinal observational data,
which was the first set of studies that we
[SPEAKER_01]: launched, survey-based data, and finally
clinical trial data, which I'm very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing my research for this
conversation, it seemed like, and you
[SPEAKER_00]: touched on it in your great summary,
that the studies that you've done can be
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of broken into a few different broad
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: One first, as you mentioned, depending on
the user type, the recreational versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical, and then age, adolescent versus
adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I'm curious too, does some of
those findings have to do with the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: product being used, whether it be kind of
high CBD versus high THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are great points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the very first thing I always like to
remind people of, because first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is a highly polarizing topic,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never actually dealt with anything in
psychiatry or neuroscience that's quite as
[SPEAKER_01]: much of a hot topic as cannabis,
and maybe a hot potato.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have very strong feelings on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either it's the devil's weed, the devil's
lettuce, and it should be outlawed
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately, if not sooner, or we should
put it in the drinking water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with those types of feelings,
it's sometimes difficult to get people to
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledge cannabis is not one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a cannabis sativa, the plant,
that is the plant from which everything
[SPEAKER_01]: comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have things that are single
extracted constituents of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The main player is delta 9 THC,
the main psychoactive or intoxicating
[SPEAKER_01]: constituent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you appropriately note,
cannabidiol or CBD, a primary
[SPEAKER_01]: non-intoxicating constituent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are lots and lots of other
cannabinoids, phyto-cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: things from the plant that interact with
our own system of chemicals and receptors,
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are terpenoids, the essential oils
that give cannabis its characteristic
[SPEAKER_01]: scent and flavor profile that have their
own bio-behavioral effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavonoids, waxy fields, you name it,
lots of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is not one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole plant, full spectrum products,
very different from single extracted
[SPEAKER_01]: purified compounds, something like an
Epidiolex purified CBD, likely very
[SPEAKER_01]: different from a non-plant derived,
that is, I made it in the lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic THC, something like Marinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things are likely to confer
different effects, but I thought one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that you mentioned was incredibly
important and I spent a lot of time
[SPEAKER_01]: reminding people, recreational or adult
cannabis use is very different from
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis use when you look at the
cohorts, that is, the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because their goals are
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recreational consumer is typically
looking to change their current state of
[SPEAKER_01]: being or to get high, and thus they look
for products high in THC, that primary
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactive constituent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our medical patients almost always say,
Dr. Gruber, I don't want to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to be able to drive my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to be able to sleep through
the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, our medical patients
often choose products with a broader
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid constituent profile that is
often dominated by non-intoxicating
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents like CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at the data that come from
our studies of recreational consumers or
[SPEAKER_01]: adult consumers of cannabis versus medical
consumers or medical patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: the data does look different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very likely because the goals of use
tend to drive product selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, as you said, a very important
distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, and I'm curious, is there sort of a
third type of user in there that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't interested in the recreational high
and maybe doesn't have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a severe condition that really needs
medical use, but maybe is interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: using cannabis just for a general wellness
supplement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually I'm a firm believer in
exactly that kind of approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people, when they begin
to understand the potential of exploiting
[SPEAKER_01]: the non-intoxicating constituents from the
plant, given the potential health benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: they may confer, they look to use it as
prophylaxis or health and wellness,
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to treating a symptom or
condition or looking to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: To your point, I think a lot of products
that are currently on the market that are
[SPEAKER_01]: classified as hemp derived, meaning they
come from a cultivar with less than 0.3%
[SPEAKER_01]: THC by weight, that's exactly what people
are using it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've decided that this is likely a
very helpful and not likely very harmful
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to add to their daily regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm curious in terms of looking at
cognitive effects, is there a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been able to look into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you've mentioned that folks
who use cannabis for a medicinal purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: actually perform better on a lot of the
measures that you've been looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any look into those who are using
it as a supplement or general wellness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they perform worse, better,
stay the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far we really have data from what I
would call the two primary cohorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, your point is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That third cohort is an important one to
think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recreational consumers we know with
earlier onset and higher frequency and
[SPEAKER_01]: magnitude of use, we tend to see some
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_01]: With tasks that are controlled or mediated
by that frontal part of the brain,
[SPEAKER_01]: which not coincidentally is the last part
of the brain to become fully developed or
[SPEAKER_01]: to come online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not surprising, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you begin to use anything,
whether it's cannabis or other substances,
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol, or if you're injured or you're
ill, very possibly you may sustain some
[SPEAKER_01]: damage or have some issues completing
tasks required, which require the part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the brain that's not yet fully developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical cannabis patient story is very
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have published some really
interesting data on rather small samples,
[SPEAKER_01]: but compelling samples of
well-characterized medical patients
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrating that at baseline where they
have no cannabis on board, and then after
[SPEAKER_01]: being tested at three months, six,
12, 18, and 24, we generally not only
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see decrements in performance,
specifically on those same types of tasks
[SPEAKER_01]: that the recreational consumers show some
difficulty with if they're early onset
[SPEAKER_01]: users, they actually do show some
improvement, which is really quite
[SPEAKER_01]: stunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people necessarily expected
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those negative effects that affect the
recreational users, is that sort of an
[SPEAKER_00]: acute sort of effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that can be overcome if
you stop use or is that sort of a lasting
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that can continue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there have been studies,
longitudinal studies that actually follow
[SPEAKER_01]: folks over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they try to identify individuals who
began using early versus those who began
[SPEAKER_01]: using later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see how things sort of quote,
turn out long-term and what happens after
[SPEAKER_01]: a protracted period of absence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of studies look at absence periods
that are several days to several weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bigger question is really what
happens if you stop using and how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: look compared to where you were when you
were using?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that there is a fair
amount of evidence suggesting that for
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals who are using with great
frequency and at high amounts who happen
[SPEAKER_01]: to be young, when they take a break or cut
down, they do tend to look a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as if there's this quote,
long-term damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, damage is a relative term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as if we're seeing, you know,
data that suggests these people can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make that very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, in our studies,
when we looked at people who were using
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very high amounts of cannabis very
frequently, it's not as if these people
[SPEAKER_01]: can't perform or can't function.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that on specific tests, we really did
see some differences in those folks versus
[SPEAKER_01]: those who began using much later on who
didn't use at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a number of studies have
demonstrated that performance does improve
[SPEAKER_01]: with protracted periods of absence or
reduction in the amount of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, primarily in those folks who are
using early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you mentioned when we were sort of
talking about the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: adolescents and adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious, in adolescents who are
looking to use cannabis, to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions like anxiety or depression or
anything like that, are there
[SPEAKER_00]: considerations that need to be taken for
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for anybody, but especially for
those who I consider are most vulnerable
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the folks who are in their
adolescent or emerging adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the brain is, quote, again,
under construction, half-baked,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want to use, not quite done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we always tell people, we're not
saying just say no, we're saying just not
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those folks, it's especially
important to remember that Delta-9-THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, the primary constituent appears to
be what confers the greatest potential
[SPEAKER_01]: decimately gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have much in the way of data
suggesting that exposure to other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid constituents like CBD cause
problems later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for folks with anxiety or difficulty
with things related to anxiety or perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: some other conditions, products high in
CBD with very low or perhaps even no THC
[SPEAKER_01]: may be a consideration versus products
with discernible and sometimes not so
[SPEAKER_01]: insignificant amounts of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people with anxiety, it's also
important to remember we have a whole set
[SPEAKER_01]: of studies dedicated to looking at
patients with moderate to severe anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to remember that THC
appears to have a very interesting impact
[SPEAKER_01]: on symptoms related to anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: At low doses, THC may be anxiolytic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, it may relieve anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, it took the edge off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm chilling, I feel okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: At low doses, at high doses, THC can
exacerbate or increase anxiety or be what
[SPEAKER_01]: we call anxiogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, make anxiety significantly worse
or create anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very important thing to be
mindful of, especially in a day where we
[SPEAKER_01]: are, I mean, bombarded with products that
the concentrate market starts like at
[SPEAKER_01]: about 35, 40% THC and goes north from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some folks, that's absolutely
okay, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people and patients with anxiety,
that can be a real problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to know, quote,
what's in your weed, which is why we
[SPEAKER_01]: conduct laboratory analyses of all of our
patients' most commonly used products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are, what compounds are you
looking for when you test it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking at, ah, terpenes and
flavonoids and stilbanoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I talk to people about all the
different compounds that are in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's staggering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an extremely complex plant and so
incredibly fascinating as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, um, you know, for our study subjects,
given the extraordinary cost of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, analyses, but the absolute need for us
to know, because the observational
[SPEAKER_01]: longitudinal study, which again,
follows real world folks using real world
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not actually creating a product in
those studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just following patients,
um, and allowing them to use whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: products they choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we want to know what's in the
product because as you have probably also
[SPEAKER_01]: heard very often, what's on the label does
not reflect what's actually in the
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really, um, having a cannabinoid
constituent profiling done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 13 cannabinoids are quantified for our
clinical trial data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, before we ever get to the
stage where we're administering
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, everything is profiled and
analyzed, including, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpenoid profile, because if we're
aiming for a specific profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to make sure we've hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think the patients find
it incredibly helpful, especially those
[SPEAKER_01]: who are spending lots of money on products
that purport to have, let's say 30 megs
[SPEAKER_01]: per mil of CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: An online product, hemp derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be shipped to them at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they wonder why they don't notice
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we, we test it for them and they
find out they don't feel anything because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got less than one meg per mil or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be incredibly frustrating
for patients and probably even equally
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrating for you as a researcher to not
have a consistent product to be able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, kind of limit those variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are some products that
continue and can, they continue and
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently test, um, exactly where they
should.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great in terms of some of
these, uh, manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's terrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, not all are created
equally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for these studies where we are
relying on patients to use the products
[SPEAKER_01]: that they select, we want them to be
getting, you know, what they are supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to be getting for the clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we have a lot more control over
it, but by and large, I think it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really helpful piece of information and a
very valuable tool for our patients to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to see, Ooh, this is not
exactly what I bargained for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk, let's talk about the clinical
trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fortunate enough to have received
several IND studies or investigational new
[SPEAKER_01]: drug approvals for a number of
indications, including, um, anxiety and
[SPEAKER_01]: pain, but starting first with anxiety,
we actually had the very first ever,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, study of whole plant, full spectrum,
high CBT, low THC, but not no THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: sublingual solution that was formulated
for patients, uh, with moderate to severe
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an openly multi-doubled line
placebo controlled trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We intended the open label phase to also
be a little bit of a dose finding study
[SPEAKER_01]: because look, this has never been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know in studies that use single
extracted compounds like Epidiolex,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, the doses that are being
used are incredibly high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also true of non plant derived
cannabidiol sources that have been used in
[SPEAKER_01]: studies of, for example, things like
social anxiety disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, you know, using the
whole platform spectrum product,
[SPEAKER_01]: would we need the same kind of dose?
[SPEAKER_01]: And anecdotally, we hear that people
experience tremendous relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using some products that they get online
at significantly lower doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we pitched it that way and the open
label phase was designed to look at 15
[SPEAKER_01]: folks who received the study product that
I formulated and they take it three times
[SPEAKER_01]: a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sublingual solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they take one mil three times a day and
hold it under their tongue for as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we basically see them every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we actually also look at THC
positive status over time because the
[SPEAKER_01]: other question for lots of folks across
the country is, Hey, if I'm using
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's derived from hemp,
I'm never going to be positive for THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if, you know, my, my workplaces
testing or if I'm worried about any other
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, um, of surveillance, I shouldn't
worry because it's from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can never be positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were very interested in figuring
out whether that was true or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't think I didn't think it
was true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we know it's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but so far we've completed the open
label phase and we have not published the
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical or the cognitive data yet,
but I can tell you that the data is really
[SPEAKER_01]: rather extraordinary and quite compelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks as if relative to baseline
after a four week trial with this custom
[SPEAKER_01]: formulated, high CVV, a low THC,
but full spectrum product symptoms,
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms related to anxiety are
significantly decreased over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also see some improvements in symptoms
related to depression, and we see
[SPEAKER_01]: improvements on measures of cognitive
performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these, these findings actually mirror
what we're seeing in the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: longitudinal, but observational study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of things to unpack here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first being lower doses of the whole
plant extract actually being as effective
[SPEAKER_00]: as the higher dose of the single compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is that the entourage effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly why we added an arm to
this particular study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this study was designed, as I
mentioned, open label to double blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The double blind is, you know,
patients either get a placebo or they get
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole plant full spectrum product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what if we could make a product that
used the same base that I created the
[SPEAKER_01]: study product from, from, but stripped
away the other cannabinoid constituents,
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpenoids and flavonoids,
everything except for the CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would that yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the answer to that,
but that would be a perfectly matched arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would tell us definitively,
um, my, my hunch is that we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: see some differences, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, to your point, I am a firm
believer that whether it's the synergy
[SPEAKER_01]: between cannabinoid constituents,
terpenoids, flavonoids, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, or just a few of the constituent,
the cannabinoids themselves, there is
[SPEAKER_01]: clearly something that is an additive
property or effect at using a whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: full or even broad spectrum type product
versus a single extracted compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, I mean, it makes sense in
conversations I've had with folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: studying the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be a very complex system with
a lot of different compounds interacting
[SPEAKER_00]: in enzymes and receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems unlikely that it's just one
compound that's producing this great
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the ways in which each
of the sort of well-known cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents exert or modulate effects,
for example, THC at CB1 or even CB2
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors versus CBD, which does not
appear to modulate its effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, through that system at all,
but uses 5-HT1A, TRIP, all sorts of other
[SPEAKER_01]: things happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, I think you get a bigger bang
for the buck, so to speak, when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using something that's a full or broad
spectrum product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be really something to be able
to actually get data, empirically sound
[SPEAKER_01]: data to support that theory, which is a
theory that, you know, some of us have had
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time, but I can understand on
the other side, people say, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: a molecule is a molecule and you know,
it's probably just this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not so sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing about, um, that stood
out to me when you were talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trial is again, you're seeing the
improvement in cognitive function,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, for folks that are using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any idea of what sort of
causing this improvement in cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: function?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, you know, actually that it's making
the brain work better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it that they're using less of other
medications or some combination of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these factors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, for a four week clinical
trial, here's what I can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see improvements in cognitive
performance and you also see clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: improvements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a reduction in anxiety or let's say
depressive symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, are they doing better on
cognitive tasks because they're less
[SPEAKER_01]: anxious and then they can actually focus
more effectively?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is it that they are no longer leaning
into or leaning on concomitant
[SPEAKER_01]: medications?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like benzodiazepines or other anxiolytics
that can compromise cognitive performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not necessarily powered to see that
from the open label phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we will look more closely at that in
the double blind phase, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I think there's a lot of things
at play again, the longitudinal
[SPEAKER_01]: observational study that we've been doing
for several years at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it looks at folks using their own
regimen over time with a really
[SPEAKER_01]: comprehensive set of assessments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far what we're seeing is
improvements in cognitive performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And clinical state quality of life,
sleep, et cetera, and a reduction in
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question becomes, isn't that these
folks are older than, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: our recreational consumers who showed some
decrements on some of these cognitive
[SPEAKER_01]: measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it that they're clinical symptoms that
have led them to wanting to use cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in the first place, whether it's chronic
pain or, you know, in our clinical trial,
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those symptoms are better so they can
focus more effectively and think more
[SPEAKER_01]: clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or is it a reduction in anxiety?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a reduction in medication use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they sleeping better and therefore
they can process more effectively?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I call the direct versus indirect
impact of using a cannabinoid based
[SPEAKER_01]: product on cognitive vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sort of already answered this
question, but I guess I'll direct,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll ask it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there, is there any research into
cognitive performance with other anti
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety medications?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they also improve it or, or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a, an important area to
look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by and large, most folks who are on
different types of conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: medications don't typically report
improvements secondary to the medication
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I would have to look at that,
um, actually, and that's, and that's an
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting thought in terms of a very
nice sort of comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically what you hear from patients who
are on anxiolytics or things to help them
[SPEAKER_01]: relax or sleep is, you know, I have this
fuzziness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a hangover.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we've all heard stories of people
using different medications who,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, had a little bit of difficulty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say the next incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, it's this, it's this little
cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't shake this cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to call it the cognitive cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that was very common in folks with
anxiety, but, you know, I don't know of
[SPEAKER_01]: studies that have done acute challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are more, um, sort of, uh,
observational studies of folks who are
[SPEAKER_01]: using these types of products who,
who.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, you know, report these types of,
um, of cognitive difficulties,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's a, that's an interesting
question from an acute administration
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious, what are sort of the more
traditional or conventional medications
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that cannabis is doing differently?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it depends on the class of
medication you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, you sort of hit on
it earlier when you said, is that the,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that the entrepreneurship factor with
regard to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things that I think
is so extraordinary and still so
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively, so it's understudy is what do
we expect when we involve different quote
[SPEAKER_01]: players who exert or modulate effects
using different mechanisms versus a
[SPEAKER_01]: medication, let's say a conventional
medication that we know is a selective
[SPEAKER_01]: serotonin re-uptake inhibitor,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: An SSRI, common treatment for depression
or anxiolytics or even opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it that's different?
[SPEAKER_01]: About cannabis in my mind, one of the
things that's, one of the things that's
[SPEAKER_01]: different is that you have multiple
players addressing multiple systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're much more likely to have,
um, an effect that does not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: confer some of the same downsides,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As, as something that is not as,
as broad, I guess I would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, to me, that's, that's incredibly
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, using the philosophy,
I think, of most, um, conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: medication approaches, you always want to
use the lowest effective dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the lowest effective dose required to
get, let's say symptom relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in our studies, what we're
finding is patients often begin using a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain regimen and then they wind up
reducing the amount that they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't seen people necessarily using
higher and higher and higher doses of
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually see a little bit of a
reduction over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that that will hold,
but that's interesting because the
[SPEAKER_01]: question I would then have is what does
their endocannabinoid profile look like
[SPEAKER_01]: over time, which is something that we'll
also be looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, what do endogenous or
inherent levels of, let's say anandamide
[SPEAKER_01]: or 2-AG, our own endocannabinoids,
what did those levels look like at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of the study versus midpoint
when they're using, you know, a product
[SPEAKER_01]: with this amount of THC or CBD versus the
end, but it might be a different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so that is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're actually testing for
endocannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we haven't begun that part of our
studies yet, but we have this set up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very, very excited to be able to
do that because I think that's one piece,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's, that's an incredibly
important part of the puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's one thing again in the
literature to look at, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: studies that have used either non plant
derived products or THC exclusively on
[SPEAKER_01]: acute symptoms like pain or muscle
spasticity as a function of NS or nausea
[SPEAKER_01]: and vomiting as a function of
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's one thing to look at,
at again, that type of administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the big question is when, when we
really want to know what's the impact of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid based treatment, we want to
look at clinical and cognitive and
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional medication use, all of the,
you know, the sort of outcome variables
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can think of sleep, quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the neurobiologic variables
that we can look at, even from your
[SPEAKER_01]: imaging, whether it's in vivo brain
metabolite ratios or how much of a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: brain metabolite you have, let's say at
the beginning of a study versus at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of a study or what your brain structure or
functioning look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things will help us to build
a much more comprehensive picture of what
[SPEAKER_01]: is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think getting a profile,
the endocannabinoid system before,
[SPEAKER_01]: during, and perhaps after, clinical trials
or even longitudinal studies will be very
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a question I've asked
a few other guests who've been talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a test, a panel that you can run
and sort of get a profile of what your
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't seem like there,
there was at least not widely available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really exciting that, that you are
going to be testing for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly not what I would call a
simple, straightforward thing where you go
[SPEAKER_01]: and buy this thing off the shelf and then
in 20 minutes you have a panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: If only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is not trivial with regard to the
expense or amount of effort required to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But frankly, you know, having the very
first neuroimaging study of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis patients wasn't so easy either,
but you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important, especially if
you can control what patients are taking
[SPEAKER_01]: in a clinical trial and really look at
this data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, before, and after you can really
begin to make some important discoveries
[SPEAKER_01]: and think about what is, and perhaps is
not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I guess I have to ask,
we've heard all of the great benefits that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can, can give, especially in
this, this clinical trial for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any downsides?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think with, with anything,
with any compound that actually can yield
[SPEAKER_01]: any effect, you always have to be mindful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we call the good, the bad,
and the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: With regard to cannabis or cannabinoids,
you know, so many constituents have been
[SPEAKER_01]: touted for so many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm the first to tell you that the
open label data is incredibly compelling,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's open label data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these patients know that they're
getting quote the sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is potential for expectancy
effects to creep in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have begun looking at that and
it's a really interesting story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you, I don't think the study
findings are related to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to your point, whether you're talking
about CBD, THC, or whole plant products,
[SPEAKER_01]: full spectrum products, broad spectrum
products, it's important for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember that cannabis is complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these constituents,
including CBD, especially CBD and THC
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with things like the primary
enzyme system of the liver, this
[SPEAKER_01]: cytochrome P450 enzyme system,
which means that inadvertently consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: could increase or decrease amounts of
other medications or products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something to be mindful of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that products that are
particularly high in THC could be
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic for some folks, for example,
who are perhaps with all great intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some, some folks get information from
cannabis devotees who say, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: I use this concentrate and it was
fantastic for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt so chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not know that the person that
they're recommending this to has more
[SPEAKER_01]: than, let's just say minor symptoms of
anxiety, or they have a genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: predisposition and a very strong family
history for perhaps psychotic disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know enough about this just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could exacerbate some, let's say less
desirable effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's always important to be
mindful of the potential downside and not
[SPEAKER_01]: go into these things, assuming that it's
absolutely benign and can do nothing but
[SPEAKER_01]: behave.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's always good to seek out
the, the council of experienced medical
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals who, who are used to
administering cannabis that can help kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of guide you in your journey for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard because everybody's also,
we're not all created equal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the genetic perspective,
that's a, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, people say, oh, you know,
we know that cannabis causes psychosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not really sure that we have the
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: To say that, but could it certainly make
things worse for people with latent
[SPEAKER_01]: psychotic, you know, with either prodromal
symptoms or very strong family or genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: histories.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something to be mindful of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean you can never use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means you need to, it's sort of like
not buyer beware, but buyer be aware,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Be mindful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what's, what's, what's in your weed,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that might be a great place to
stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want to be respectful of your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very much appreciate you taking the
time to, to be on the podcast with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I let you go, I do want to give
you the opportunity to tell folks where
[SPEAKER_00]: they can find more information about mind,
about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a website or social media or
anything that you want to plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of the updates about the mind
program has a number of different studies
[SPEAKER_01]: from the longitude observational studies
to the a number of survey based studies to
[SPEAKER_01]: the clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a program dedicated to veterans
serving those who have served.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a program dedicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called WIM or the women's health
initiative at Miami.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lots of specialized initiatives
and you can learn more about that at www
[SPEAKER_01]: .stacy, drstacygrouber.com or just
drstacygrouber.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually the same for social
media, for Twitter and Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the great place to find some of
the latest, greatest stuff that's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the lab, including the,
the very newest study looking at hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the clinical trial product and
the THC positive status was really quite
[SPEAKER_01]: an interesting discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using a hemp based product and
think, nah, I could never turn positive on
[SPEAKER_01]: the urine test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Oh, that's not the case,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% of our sample was positive after four
weeks, despite zero reports, zero reports
[SPEAKER_01]: of intoxication or feeling high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no relationship to the
actual amount of study product used.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weigh the bottles on the way out and on
the way in or body mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't matter how big the folks were
or how much product they were taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw a relationship only with urinary
creatinine, which is a measure of kidney
[SPEAKER_01]: function and hydration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, really important, especially
for, for people who think, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: these urine tests, you know, the lower
limit of detection is very often 50
[SPEAKER_01]: nanograms per mil or in the workplace,
sometimes 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our data also suggests that for some of
those assays, they are more sensitive than
[SPEAKER_01]: they are supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see positive results at far lower
levels than 50 nanograms per mil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do the in-house test and then we send
it out for quantification using GCMS and
[SPEAKER_01]: we were rather surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you doing, are you performing
potency testing on the product itself as
[SPEAKER_00]: well?
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there just a lot more THC than folks
think is in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't potency testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just THC positive status for the
clinical trial patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you be positive if you used a
hemp-derived product that's high in CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: and very low in THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you, our study product has
between 0.27 to 0.29 mgs per mil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not by weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mgs per mil.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a whole lot more CBD than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere around 10 mgs per mil,
which doesn't sound like a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but three times the death.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, it's about 30 is the targeted dose
for this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after such a low level, so that's less
than one milligram of THC per day after
[SPEAKER_01]: four weeks, would you be positive?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is half of the sample was
positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important, especially since
products that you can buy commercially
[SPEAKER_01]: online, you can have 0.3% by weight,
which again, ours is 0.02.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more than 10 times the amount of
THC as in our study product is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our study folks, half of the sample
was positive after four weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but despite never feeling high or
intoxicated at all, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you only testing after four weeks or
was it every week and it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulates in the body or how is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't test after every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no, no, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have in lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually look at that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big question really was after four
weeks, but we did, we sent laboratory,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had laboratory analysis, we confirmed
after week three and week five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's after two weeks of product and
four weeks of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we published the two week
data, but we did weekly assays in lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much, so much to learn about this plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it'll keep us employed for awhile,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly couldn't be more interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you with the sheer numbers
of consumers and patients using cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: for lots of different things, especially
our older population, it's never been more
[SPEAKER_01]: important for us to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I always like to say the good,
the bad, and the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to us to try to help people make
the best decisions they can about a really
[SPEAKER_01]: complex, but rather extraordinary plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just what we're trying to do at
CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to seeing you out in
Pasadena.
