[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really some wonderful talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might actually be bringing it down here,
because I'm going to go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: purified compounds, the synthetic
compounds, T and CBD, and really focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm hoping to get out of this
talk with you is to have some knowledge of
[SPEAKER_00]: the basic mechanisms that can be seen
across both with THC and CBD that lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-tumor activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a picture of our institute,
and we're located right downtown by the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballpark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this group really needs a
definition of cannabinoids, so I'll skip
[SPEAKER_00]: this slide, and I'll go through a couple
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly, so we can get to questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'm just trying to show you the
structural diversity of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been impressed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our, of course, natural
plant-derived cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have synthetic versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a compound I'm going to talk about
later, which we've really developed to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on anti-tumor properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our endogenous agonists,
our cannabinoid receptor antagonists,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is one of my recent favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just call it BCP because it's a
mouthful, but this is from the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, it's a CB2 agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really impressive for a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically a clinical review of
many, basically, therapeutic agents that
[SPEAKER_00]: either been in the clinic or are actually
making their way through the clinic
[SPEAKER_00]: through what I call more standard routes,
more standard drug development routes,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can read through those,
but I'm actually going to focus here down
[SPEAKER_00]: on the anti-tumor agents, and this you
might not be as familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's actually three companies right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little bit about this
clinical trial and that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually going after targeting
brain cancer in patients, so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, we'll have some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are basically, they're getting the
trials set up, but again, in these cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using cannabinoid base.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trial I'll show you is the Cetivex
Insys Therapeutics is going to use CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: alone, and this company is using a
synthetic version of THC that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive called dexanabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk a little bit about
cannabinoids and cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we're all very familiar with
using THC and cannabis-based products to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat the symptoms associated with cancer
treatment, inhibition of pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: to enhance appetite and decrease nausea,
but actually, there's very strong
[SPEAKER_00]: preclinical data showing that both CBD and
THC act as direct anti-tumor agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there's preclinical evidence,
and this is all in mouse models,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that both CBD and THC can inhibit
chemotherapy-induced neuropathy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be a real issue with a
subpopulation of people getting treated
[SPEAKER_00]: for cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, some of the more recent data
shows that both CBD and THC can sensitize
[SPEAKER_00]: the cancer cells to first-line agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a direct activity on inhibiting
cancer progression, and you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to sensitize the first-line agents
that you're going to get in your cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of all of that building
into a funnel, and in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you get is, of course, we have the
improved palliative care that we all know
[SPEAKER_00]: about, but the hope is here that we're
going to be able to also inhibit cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: progression and prolong survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a historical slide, and it's fun
because it shows the small world of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid science.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first study that showed anti-tumor
activity of cannabinoids, direct
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-tumor activity, was done in 1975 by
Dr. Munson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He happened to be my toxicology teacher at
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, I didn't even know he had
done this study, but that's how small that
[SPEAKER_00]: world is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In about 1998, Christina Sanchez,
she's been talked about a couple of times
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and she did one of the first
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very low, small paper just
looking at the ability of THC to inhibit
[SPEAKER_00]: the viability of glioma cells in culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that and I thought, wow,
that doesn't look like a standard,
[SPEAKER_00]: typical cannabinoid profile, and that's
why I got into the field because of that
[SPEAKER_00]: single paper by Christina.
[SPEAKER_00]: About two years later, Manuel Guzman's
group, the group in Spain, actually
[SPEAKER_00]: published this pivotal paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a nature medicine paper which
really caused the resurgence of focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: research on the direct anti-tumor activity
of cannabinoids, and that's resulted in
[SPEAKER_00]: over 100 publications now across many
different types of cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this very complex signal
transduction pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really just want to focus on two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to remember
autophagy-mediated cell death because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to come up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an important aspect of the ability
of, at least with THC and CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another portion I want you to focus on is
this AMPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is an ROS sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get reactive oxygen species in
the body, this is a sensor of reactive
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen species, and I'm going to talk why
I think reactive oxygen species are
[SPEAKER_00]: critical in terms of the anti-tumor
properties of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to Christina's paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon after that paper, because I'm a
pharmacologist, I specialize in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I screened all the compounds I had
available in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was most surprising to me is that out
of all the compounds I screened,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol was the most potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Deborah, earlier for talking about
micromolar, but this is all expressed in
[SPEAKER_00]: micromolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That surprised me because a lot of
literature was suggesting this was
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid receptor-mediated,
but CBD doesn't interact efficiently with
[SPEAKER_00]: those receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly doesn't activate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, of course, to me was of
great interest is, as we all know,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC gets you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is that important to me as a
scientist?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easier grant to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds crazy, but it is a much
easier grant to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go in and say, I'm going to use
THC, NIH is going to get nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew right away with focusing on CBD
that that would actually get them more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested and at least get me funding so
I could study both the compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the strategy I took, and it worked
rather well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an overview of the efficacy
data in the vivo model.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have here is, this is a triple
negative breast cancer model in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are lungs, so the tumor actually
metastasizes to the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's actually, you can see the very
prominent tumor formation in the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a mouse treated with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very obvious the efficacy of the
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at the same, looked at CBD
in brain cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, see the purple portion?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all tumor throughout the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a GBM or a very aggressive form of
brain cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here again is, once you treat the CBD,
you can really see it's localized to one
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some of the efficacy data right up
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my complicated pathway,
but really what I want you to get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this is just to remember some key words so
that when people ask you about direct
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-tumor agents, direct anti-tumor
agents, you can say, oh yeah, autophagy,
[SPEAKER_00]: reactive oxygen species, and hopefully ID1
because that's my pet gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I'm going to focus first on
ROS.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found, and in this case,
this is a human triple negative breast
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found is that when you increase
the concentration of CBD, you produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly profound amount of reactive oxygen
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all cells, that's bad if you produce
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer cells actually have mechanisms to
deal with ROS because they're more
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolically active than normal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually have mechanisms to deal with
this, but at a certain point, they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with the ROS overload.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting here is this is
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our positive control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in this cancer cell,
CBD is highly effective at producing
[SPEAKER_00]: reactive oxygen species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you then take a normal
non-transformed cell and compare it to,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the mouse triple negative,
the human breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the drug is much more
effective at producing reactive oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: species in cancer cells, but not normal
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That data has been basically the
selectivity between normal cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cells has been shown by many groups
that these compounds are selective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely no reason to really focus on
all the data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really to make a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically got many actually primary
tumors from brain cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We treated a variety of these tumors with
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to get a gene expression profile
across many tumors from many different
[SPEAKER_00]: patients to look at some of the key
pathways that were either up-regulated or
[SPEAKER_00]: down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want you to focus on here again is
with CBD, one of the top pathways was
[SPEAKER_00]: autophagy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that circles back to THC,
which is also producing autophagy-mediated
[SPEAKER_00]: cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have THC and CBD quite different,
but both impinging upon this
[SPEAKER_00]: autophagy-mediated cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, it doesn't really matter about
these names, these represent pathways that
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb ROS.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you over-produce ROS, these are
pathways that basically get up-regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with that insult.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was another top hit in these cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really these cells, when they're treated
with cannabidiol, they're dealing with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of ROS.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pathways are up-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed that actually in preclinical
mouse models of brain cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only in culture, but also in the
preclinical models.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dealing with a lot of ROS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, one of my favorite genes,
ID1, was highly down-regulated in these
[SPEAKER_00]: tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to explain a little bit more
about ID1 and why it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: ID1 is a key gene in the involvement of
metastatic progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a localized tumor and you need
to get out of that space, travel through
[SPEAKER_00]: the bloodstream, get to different organs,
ID genes are key genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually embryonic genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in differentiated adult
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from the state when you're in
embryology.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, you do need the genes
because you have to develop your pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything has to travel to different
sites as you're building the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of cancer, what it does is it
usurps that gene and brings it back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: adult tissues and then it allows it to
travel and go to distant sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of a cancer patient, if you have
this gene, it's not good prognosis for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm showing you here is that across
many different types of cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called a Western.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, this is the expression of the
ID1 protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you don't see the black, that means
that it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked across all sorts of aggressive
cancers that actually express these
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins and we found across all of these
cancers, if you treat them with CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: you basically are able to turn off this
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that ID1 works is it's a negative
transcriptional regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it binds, it turns off transcription,
but that's important downstream and let me
[SPEAKER_00]: explain why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of ID1 as a conductor or
the conductor of many events that happen
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream in the process of metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a master regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upstream, when this gets turned on,
it causes all these downstream events that
[SPEAKER_00]: then lead to different aspects of
metastatic progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can actually cut off the master
regulator, you can cut off all these
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream events.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been lots of publications by other
scientists showing indeed this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a very important gene in metastatic
progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just many papers just talking
about how important ID1 is in cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some of the original data that we
published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, back to our Western analysis,
here's ID1 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's expressed here as you add
more drug, it basically disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the first Western we did,
we thought we made a mistake because
[SPEAKER_00]: generally you don't see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We compared it against other cannabinoid
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just ID1 expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's effective, again,
at down-regulating that expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: but other cannabinoids are less effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: One measure of studying metastasis,
at least in culture, is looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: invasion, the ability of these cells to
invade through matrix, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: representation of them invading through
tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the drug is effective in inhibiting
invasion, which makes sense with
[SPEAKER_00]: down-regulating this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a review of our approach taking a
standard pharmacological approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an effective inhibitor of ID1.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a pharmacologist, what we do next is we
try and create analogs that are even more
[SPEAKER_00]: active than CBD at targeting ID1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call this drug not really a
cannabinoid anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a resource in all
derivative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to term it as an ID1 inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go down to our Western analysis
again, here's CBD and here is the analog.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more potent at inhibiting ID1.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least with metastatic breast cancer,
when a patient comes in and presents,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's usually later stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the preclinical models don't
actually model later stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They model earlier stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is because, of course,
you're most likely to get the drug at a
[SPEAKER_00]: more advanced stage, we modeled that in
mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two models we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one model, which is a mouse,
triple negative breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the mouse has a functional
immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, you have basically an immune
system that's been compromised so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: mouse can actually grow a human metastatic
tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two models.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first mouse model, we just compared
the activity of CBD and our analog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just orient you to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 percent means the mouse, all patients
or mice are alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as it decreases, this is mice that
don't survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this model, basically, as soon as they
start to show a symptom of tumor burden,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're taken out of the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's CBD in terms of survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the analog we created.
[SPEAKER_00]: At two months, 50 percent of the mice were
still alive, which with this very
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive model is very impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should note that with CBD in the earlier
stages models, it was effective in earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: stage models.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we got to the more advanced stage
models, it wasn't as effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: hence the thought to create an analog and
really focus in on the ID protein story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it had already shown using genetic
approaches that if you basically decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: the expression of this gene, you could
produce substantial inhibition of
[SPEAKER_00]: metastatic progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the idea there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we use advanced stages here,
advanced stage model here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this analog was quite effective in
increasing survival, at least in this
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the literature with ID proteins,
if you downregulate the ID protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do is you will sensitize the
cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is multiple types of cancers,
the first-line agents, just because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: way the gene works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the simple experiment would be,
well, if CBD can downregulate this gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should be able to sensitize the
cancers, the first-line agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call a combination index
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really need to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all you need to know is that
anything below one is a synergistic
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We combine CBD with the standard
first-line agent for triple negative
[SPEAKER_00]: breast cancer, paclitaxel.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see in both this, in four T1
cell lines, this is a derivative of that
[SPEAKER_00]: triple negative human breast cancer cell
line I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see synergistic activity,
at least in culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to transition into this case study
based on that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the publication with CBD and ID,
proteins, and just our groups focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, I get a lot of case reports sent
to me from patients, particularly when
[SPEAKER_00]: they've seen efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's definitely cases where
I've seen patients that have been on this
[SPEAKER_00]: and said that the drug didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a cancer setting, that makes
complete sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every tumor is going to respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's a success case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a patient that actually had
metastatic breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were treated originally, but then it
recurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it's fairly dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see basically tumors all over the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: This patient then went on a cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the makeup of the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: From September 2013 to January 2014,
along with the first-line agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did go back in for another round,
their first-line agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, basically, this is what
happened with the patient that came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is unusual, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's convincing anecdotal evidence,
certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, this question comes up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell this is great in this form
because of the talks before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's better, the drug alone,
CBD alone, or CBD combined with THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, of course, THC, CBD, and all
these other components that could be in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a question I get a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is, I think it's going to be
very specific, not only for the cancer you
[SPEAKER_00]: try and treat, but also the subtypes
within a cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to show you a little
bit of what I call hard evidence to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you the complexity of this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is this model of metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is 100% metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the number goes down, it means
there's less metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, at least in this model,
this is the most inhibition that THC could
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the most inhibition that CBD
could produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a maximum effective dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you combine them, you actually
get greater activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could say, in this model,
at least in the 4T1 triple negative model,
[SPEAKER_00]: combining THC and CBD is more effective
than either of the drugs alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we then take, this is a study
we recently did where we compared the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability of CBD versus CBD plus THC,
this is a one to one ratio, to basically
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance the activity of TMZ in a,
and this is a GBM model, a glioblastoma
[SPEAKER_00]: model, brain cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is the survival model.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the survival curve, but let's
focus on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically CBD plus TMZ and versus
CBD, sorry, CBD alone versus CBD plus TMZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now overall, they didn't produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They enhanced the activity of CBD,
certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very positive result.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you compare the two drugs,
there's really no difference between using
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD alone versus the combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in this case, a subset of
animals, the tumors did regress
[SPEAKER_00]: completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And didn't return in the CBD group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has happened before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also happened in that original Nature
paper I showed you as well when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: using THC alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, overall survival, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were this patient, you'd be
very happy about getting CBD alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a complex problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at only a small amount of
tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, what we're trying to do is look
across many different patient types of
[SPEAKER_00]: tumors to get more of a profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it will be a complicated
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this brings us finally to the GBM
trial that's actually was done by GW
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to quickly just go over
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the patients were on board with
Cetivex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all the dose and information on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this off of, basically, this is off
the clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GW hasn't published the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm wrong and GW is here,
they can inform us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, what they found,
it's a pretty impressive enhancement of
[SPEAKER_00]: survival when they were treated with
Cetivex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, they went from basically,
let's see, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they went from 369 in the
controls to 550 days with the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually fairly impressive in
GBM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hope that it pans out when they go
to a larger clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll say thank you very much for
your time.
Thank you.
