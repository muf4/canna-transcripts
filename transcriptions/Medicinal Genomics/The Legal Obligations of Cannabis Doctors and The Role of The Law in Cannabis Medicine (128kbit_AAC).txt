[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Michael Levinson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a trial attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually speak to about 12 people right
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to imagine that there are 12
people right in front of me right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: or everybody can move to the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many doctors do we have here?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many lawyers do we have here?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I do that is because when I do
a trial, I usually know a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: the jury before I start talking to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had thought about different ways to do
this, and I think what I finally decided
[SPEAKER_00]: on, I don't think what I finally decided
on, I know what I finally decided on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to get my timer started so I
know exactly how much time I'm taking,
[SPEAKER_00]: is in simple terms, everybody remember the
Glamour magazine back in the, I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: started maybe in the 70s, the 80s,
they used to have the Glamour fashion
[SPEAKER_00]: dews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fashion don'ts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were Glamour dews and don'ts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to touch on some of the
more important medical legal cannabis dews
[SPEAKER_00]: and don'ts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your Glamour magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to fashion, a do,
as an example, is always consider basic
[SPEAKER_00]: black for a formal affair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't it, it was Coco and Chanel or
someone who invented the little black
[SPEAKER_00]: dress, and it's never wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never failed anybody in a formal affair.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do whatever this is supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't figure it out between my wife
and my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew what this was, but everybody
knew it was a don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic considerations for a doctor,
if you're going to be recommending medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, it really depends on what state
you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: California is very kind of loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in California, there are several listed
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, of the doctors here,
who are in California?
[SPEAKER_00]: No California doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously everybody else is from another
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first thing you really need to
do is you need to make sure that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the rules in your state, because they
really do vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, the first medical marijuana
state, the rule was, the way that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: put into existence was through a voter
initiative called the Compassionate Use
[SPEAKER_00]: Act, and it listed several conditions,
AIDS, glaucoma, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: or any condition for which marijuana
provides relief, which was pretty vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other states is very strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to very much know what your
state rules are, or you can run into
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble, and that's the whole point of my
talk, is so that you don't run into
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of history and exam is required?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the questions you need to think
about if you're going to be doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California now, the medical board does
not have specific requirements,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does require or does recommend
strongly that you get medical records,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least relating to the condition for
which cannabis use is being sought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody says that they,
I'll disclose that I have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: ulcerative colitis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I went to the doctor to get a
recommendation for cannabis, they said,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your condition?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I have ulcerative colitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your GI docs send me some records.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think that I'm telling you that
because people already know that,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of doctors that maybe know
it, but they aren't doing it, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: running into trouble for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want that kind of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of cannabis would work best for
your patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, that's what seminars like
this are for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't certainly tell anybody really
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've had enough exposure to this
industry for long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably have some pretty good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you come to seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You communicate with other doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the time was when I was first
litigating cases of this kind,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole marijuana, it's all just
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: How could that help anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that ship is long since sailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a designer drug, and there's
various kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, that last speaker, I had a
chance to speak with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before today, and in the exhibit hall
where the companies are selling their
[SPEAKER_00]: wares, they're selling genetic tests to
match the patient to the drugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's being done already in some
other kinds of medicine, and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly be done in medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to quantities, and I say
very general, and the reason for that is
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosing is one of the biggest issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a tricky problem for doctors,
both medically and legally, and the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: for that is because you can't really
prescribe it in the same way that you do
[SPEAKER_00]: other medicines, because you don't really
know when that person, you don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you write a script for 50 milligrams
of whatever it is, and they take it down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the pharmacy, you know what they're
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that they're getting the medicine
that you've prescribed for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really know that when they go
down to a medical cannabis dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have some idea, pretty good idea,
now that they've honed the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: production, so you have six to one,
and four to one, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also don't have the analytical
data that you would otherwise have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be very careful about talking
about dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to probably say this two or
three times as I go along, but one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you, for sure, want to be
careful about saying is that this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to say this is what I have
found through my experience with my
[SPEAKER_00]: patients to have worked for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it, which is, if true,
is really what you are saying anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you need to be very careful about how
you word your medical orders or your
[SPEAKER_00]: medical advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will I ever have to go to court to back
this up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, let's hope you don't,
but you always have to be thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: that, because you may need to go into
court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody that you have recommended
cannabis to could get arrested,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I've had this happen, where I've had to
represent parents who had their children
[SPEAKER_00]: taken away because a doctor recommended
cannabis for their child.
[SPEAKER_00]: The child was smelled like it at school.
[SPEAKER_00]: The children were taken away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, they got to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the case beat pretty fast,
but that's not an experience that that
[SPEAKER_00]: parent will soon forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we got them back into the home pretty
much right away, it was about a two months
[SPEAKER_00]: protracted legal battle that cost them a
good deal of money and untold amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, and that's not something you want
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That particular scenario will come up a
couple more times in my talk, but the gist
[SPEAKER_00]: of it is, if you're going to say something
to a patient and recommend a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment to them, you have to keep in the
back of your mind, somebody may ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: about this one day, and you may need to
show why you did this, why you did it the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that you did it, how much,
when, who, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will I ever have to justify my actions to
the medical board?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's hope not, but you might.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California currently, in order to
recommend cannabis, what you're supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be is you are now required to consider
yourself the attending physician,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you are taking primary care,
primary responsibility for the patient's
[SPEAKER_00]: care, at least as it relates to their use
of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean you have to treat them
for everything, it doesn't mean you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be on call for them 24 hours a day,
it means that you are responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: their use of cannabis and for being able
to explain to the medical board why,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, this schizophrenic patient
that you didn't get the records for and
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really inquire into then wound up
having all of these problems because you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't pay attention to the fact that you
probably shouldn't recommend cannabis to a
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem that three of my clients
have had before they got to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's something you want to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you want to pay attention
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do, remember we're doing the dos and the
don'ts, this is a medical cannabis do,
[SPEAKER_00]: do get sufficient medical records before
evaluating a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think that that would be just de
rigueur, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody would ever think about not doing
that and you would be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can now very easily, this is,
well, you can walk into some dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: that sell the cannabis in this state,
you can do plink, plink, plink on an iPad
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have in the front lobby and then
you will go in back and they'll say did
[SPEAKER_00]: you get approved and they'll go plink,
plink, plink and you will have been
[SPEAKER_00]: approved, you will have never spoken to
anyone, you will have produced no medical
[SPEAKER_00]: records, you will have done nothing more
than show them your driver's license,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a word for that, illegal,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is illegal and it's being
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you might ask, well, how do they do
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they get away with that if it's
illegal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I mean, I drove down here
from the Bay Area on late Monday and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going about 85 miles an hour, I didn't get
a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just not enough cops to catch
everybody that's speeding and it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing in this business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't police it that tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody really reports these things the
way that they should, I suppose,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't tell your patient a list of
complaints that would qualify and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: them to pick one, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had two doctors as patients who did
that, excuse me, as clients who did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody came into their office,
they said, you know, I really don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to use, I don't really, you know,
have a medical problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to get an excuse that I can
use medical, or I can use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smoke marijuana, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that was before Prop 64, which made it
a lot easier if you're over 21 to use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just buy it and you can possess
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have a medical excuse
for it, but you can still run into this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with someone who's between the
ages of 18 and 21 in this state and in any
[SPEAKER_00]: other state, they still have to have a
genuinely qualifying condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what happened in these two cases
essentially is somebody told the doctor,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, I don't really have anything wrong
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to be able to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy said, well, look, the doctor
said, well, look, I can't give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation unless you tell me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, here's the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just point to one and we'll write it up
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that doctor did that twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third time and the fourth
time and the fifth time that he did it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that he did it to were
undercover investigators for the
[SPEAKER_00]: California Medical Board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was then brought before the board,
very serious charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had this all recorded, okay,
because they were wearing a wire when they
[SPEAKER_00]: were in his office.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very convincing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very good at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ran into some trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't remain my client throughout the
entire process because he was quite
[SPEAKER_00]: indignant about the thing that he was
frankly most indignant about was the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had recorded him inside of his
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: How could they do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a private medical consultation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a violation of my rights and their
privacy and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only answer to that is,
yeah, but how else would they catch
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody doing this without recording?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, this was a, you know, basically
what my grandmother would have called
[SPEAKER_00]: Meshuggah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to run it into some serious
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point being don't do that or don't
do anything similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just find out what's wrong with them,
if they can say, and if you feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's sufficient records to support it,
and if you feel that it's appropriate,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can recommend cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do start by recommending the least amount
necessary to relieve symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that not the basic medical rule for
prescribing medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're not sure, the least amount
necessary, start with the least amount
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary to relieve symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start, I guess, I don't know whether it's
visible there, start low and go slow is
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's supposed to say there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is generally the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly when it comes to
cannabis, because again, even if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: now, if you can know that you're
recommending a four to one or a six to one
[SPEAKER_00]: oil or something like that, you don't know
exactly how much they're using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know the regular basis that
they're using it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the overarching scientific problem,
I guess, with recommending cannabis or the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason it can't really be prescribed
traditionally is there are far too many
[SPEAKER_00]: variables to know which of the variables
is at play in changing the patient's
[SPEAKER_00]: condition, either to the positive or to
the negative, because you don't know for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure which one of the multiple variables
in the chemical itself, let alone their
[SPEAKER_00]: variables, are affecting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than the simplest way to deal
with that problem is to just titrate small
[SPEAKER_00]: increments and see what changes you get
and then evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires infinitely more work
than most of the doctors that I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, and have dealt with in this
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some very, very good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they do is they're in constant
communication with their patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: emails, telephone calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work to do this,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just a matter of taking the
money with the left hand and handing the
[SPEAKER_00]: letter with the right hand and then
saying, see you later, which is what many
[SPEAKER_00]: of these, unfortunately, many of these
businesses still do, at least in this
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use a pre-printed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular doctor was the doctor for
a client of mine who got in trouble for
[SPEAKER_00]: how much he was growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of thing that used to
happen before Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still happening in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not currently charged generally
as crimes in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a civil violation where this
gentleman is being, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to get multiple thousands
of fines against him for how many plants
[SPEAKER_00]: he grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you see at the top, it says he got
a 99 plant recommendation and it can have
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain amount of weight, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big, big don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that because first off,
you're not an expert in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, you don't know what strain this
person is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know how large these plants are,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many things that you simply
cannot and do not know that you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: write it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole legal explanation for the
99 plant letter, which was sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the big deal between about 2004 and about
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all, it's not worth the time to
explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all sort of this way to kind of do
this little dipsy-doo around federal law
[SPEAKER_00]: and state law and medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, it never worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other problem, this is a don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna give you a, I guess a double
don't off of this one, which is that 99
[SPEAKER_00]: plant recommendation, that was a
pre-printed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I asked the doctor about it,
I said, so why did you write a
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation for 99 plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, I didn't write it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the 50 plant one and the 99
plant one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 50 plant one, that's 145 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 99 plant one, that's 245 bucks,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a word for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the word?
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some shoulder surgery a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'd have gone to the doctor to see doc,
you know, it's a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get me something for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, well listen, I can get you
the 25 milligram, one week OxyContin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the 100 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trying to go full bore,
you want to really roll with this thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want the 50 milligram, you want three
weeks, that's 250, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a word for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal, very illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this doctor, when I spoke to her about
this, was absolutely flabbergasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what she told me when I,
and this was recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, that kind of thing right there,
that was a little more common 10 years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked her, I said, again,
we were discussing this, and I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: well look, you know, I mean, you really,
I don't know if I can use you as a witness
[SPEAKER_00]: because now you have a Fifth Amendment
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you testify to what you did there,
you'll be admitting, your truthful
[SPEAKER_00]: testimony is the admission of a crime,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying you're a criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying I can't, as a lawyer,
I have to advise you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to get counseled if I'm going
to call you as a witness.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, really, everybody does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is common practice in the medical
business in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, okay, well,
you know, it's like, what did your
[SPEAKER_00]: grandmother tell you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because everybody else is jumping off
the Brooklyn Bridge, you're going to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared to back your recommendations
and opinions in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a do, do be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, I just, I had to get a
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the doctor who testified,
this absolutely wonderful doctor who
[SPEAKER_00]: testified in that police murder case in
Minneapolis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the pulmonologist with that
lilting Irish accent who explained what
[SPEAKER_00]: the police did and how it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever want to learn how to
testify in court as a doctor, I advise
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors about that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, just watch his YouTube
testimony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an absolute textbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is a textbook in how to handle
it, how to say it, how to come across
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how to explain technical stuff well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't disappear or avoid your
patients when they have a legal issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The client that I was telling you about
whose children were taken away,
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctor that recommended cannabis to
her for her daughter who was autistic was
[SPEAKER_00]: an orthopedist who was moonlighting as a
medical cannabis doctor writing letters
[SPEAKER_00]: for, I don't know how much of pop,
I never asked him that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me four calls to just have him get
on the phone with me and explain why he
did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did this and what he had done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the reasons that this mom's
children were taken away was because the
[SPEAKER_00]: child protective service, when this was
going on before they took the children
[SPEAKER_00]: away, called him four times, never picked
up, never responded to their calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just figured, ah, he's a
schlockmeister.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to worry about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then they wrote in their affidavit
for taking the children, the warrant that
[SPEAKER_00]: they got to take the children,
they said, that she had not consulted with
[SPEAKER_00]: a medical professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they had a written copy of the
recommendation letter, they, they assumed
[SPEAKER_00]: they just said later in court,
they thought it was fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't, you know, the doctor never
followed through, never called,
[SPEAKER_00]: called them, et cetera.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention, excuse me, just as a,
as an aside, this is the number one
[SPEAKER_00]: complaint when it comes to lawyers and
doctors in that sense are probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: terribly much different in this regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one complaint for, since I've
been practicing law, every time I go to
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the continuing legal education
seminars, how to not get in trouble with
[SPEAKER_00]: your clients, return their phone calls,
return their emails, be, be responsive to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the, some of the clients that have
liked me the best and sent me the best
[SPEAKER_00]: referrals are not necessarily the ones
that get the best outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that felt like I cared
about her, you know, that I actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do care about it, but I'm saying you
have to respond to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, and even if it's not just for a
business, from a business standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: your patients can get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't get, if somebody who's
looking into their status doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: through to the doctor, that can be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do evaluate the patient's needs for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a little bit repetitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was putting this together,
I was working with my son and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching me PowerPoint and I, I tripped a
couple of times, but this is about getting
[SPEAKER_00]: medical records.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be the first question you ask
when someone calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you send us records?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you send us records?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a very good friend who's a pretty
prominent cannabis doctor and the first
[SPEAKER_00]: question that their staff asks when
somebody calls is, can you, when can you
[SPEAKER_00]: send us or to the effect of, can you send
us your records?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they say they don't want to do
that, they just say, thank you,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the records, you look through
them, then you make the appointment,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't recommend specific amounts unless it
is required in your state, which I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: aware that any state recommend requires
doctors to prescribe, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: to prescribe specific amounts of cannabis,
but otherwise don't because you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: really prescribe cannabis in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't the analytical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are too many variables and there are
too many other, there are too many
[SPEAKER_00]: variables in the product that may end up
in the hands of your patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about go, start slow,
start low, go slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, we're gonna shift gears a little
bit to driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This always comes up when I give this talk
or something similar to this talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fail to advise your patients on the
effects of cannabis combined with alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: or prescription drugs for driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis itself, excuse me, isn't
necessarily all that damaging when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, excuse me, one has to be
considered impaired, not just under the
[SPEAKER_00]: influence, but impaired if they're driving
and there is a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the influence means that the
medication or drug is having its intended
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not necessarily impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general, let's see if I got this in
the right order, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general admonition that doctors,
and please correct me if I've got this not
[SPEAKER_00]: quite right, but this has come up in my
court cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general admonition that doctors to
give a patient about driving is,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the exception of alcohol,
which has a per se limit of blood alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration that everyone agrees,
at least legally speaking agrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: is unlawful to have in your blood when
driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not true for any drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, for example, it is unlawful
to drive under the influence of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any drug, and that includes prescription
medications, or the combined effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol in any drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, excuse me, but when it comes to a
drug, if it is having its intended effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are not presumed to be impaired,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general way in which the courts have
now ruled, the way in which to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: whether someone is genuinely impaired by a
drug is primarily by the way that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it actually involves a police
officer called a drug recognition expert
[SPEAKER_00]: who has to do this kind of complicated
exam, when it comes to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are largely only two sobriety tests
that are supposed to really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is lack of convergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, presumably the doctors know what this
is, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an object moves toward your eyes,
they're supposed to converge, and if they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't converge just right, that's evidence
that you may have cannabis on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess it's also the case that
something like 25% of the population has
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of convergence anyway, so it's maybe
not all that conclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is called the slowed
internal clock, which means that what they
[SPEAKER_00]: typically do is they have you close your
eyes and estimate when 30 seconds have
[SPEAKER_00]: passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close your eyes and have you estimate when
30 seconds have passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it takes you too long, then they can
say that cannabis may have caused that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consistent with cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do familiarize yourself with the laws of
your state, their state's many doctors,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the possession and use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that an hour or two of legal
consultation is too expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying this for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do mostly criminal defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been around long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get pretty good fees from people that do
really twisted stuff, so I don't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about consulting with doctors all
that much, so this isn't some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: advertisement for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for your own good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just find a good lawyer in wherever you
practice medicine, and just pay for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple hours of their time, an hour or two
of their time to make sure that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: bumping up against the law, because the
law's an unfriendly cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give legal advice to your patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, oh boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctors I know that do this,
that I do consult with, they're constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, well, what can I tell my patient
about the laws and what's legal for them
[SPEAKER_00]: to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to that is nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to refer them to a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really can't give legal advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, that's a very dangerous game to
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Refer them to a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's published materials in your
state, which there probably is,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly refer them to that, but do not
give them legal advice, even if you think
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you're right, even if you think
you know you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do tell your patients what you have found
to be effective in your practice for your
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to prescribe it or to
recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say, this is what you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, for example, it's extremely
tricky because doctors are not allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: have any financial relationship with any
producer or provider of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can certainly run into trouble if
you start going down that road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just say, this is what I have found.
[SPEAKER_00]: My patients have found to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't recommend specific amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of those somewhat redundant
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, did I miss one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do understand the difference between hemp
and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The long explanation is that the FDA has
not yet approved or given its signature to
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp for medicinal use, and that's why
when you hear those ads on the radio for
[SPEAKER_00]: it's legal in every state and it's the
greatest, blah, blah, blah, what's that
[SPEAKER_00]: last tagline?
[SPEAKER_00]: This product is not intended to diagnose,
treat, or cure any medical condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is being advertised as a medical
product, as a health-related medical
[SPEAKER_00]: product, then there's a word for that,
illegal, and the FDA has not approved this
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not policing it because,
like when I'm driving 85, they just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like it's something they're going to
expend that much, and they feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually they will, and they're changing
their rules, but right now they haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody knows that marijuana is the
plant with 3% of THC, delta 9,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a difference, but that farm
bill that everybody thought just turned
[SPEAKER_00]: the world around, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that hemp is legal to buy and
sell as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've already covered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do understand the difference between
clinical data and trial data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clinical data, and I'll let a doctor
correct me if I'm wrong, clinical data is
[SPEAKER_00]: your experience with your patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trial data is what pharmaceutical
companies produce through double-blind
[SPEAKER_00]: studies, which really haven't been done
with the exception of a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: medications that are currently approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do realize that with medical cannabis,
what you do is more art than science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I was a little kid,
my pediatrician, I remember seeing this
[SPEAKER_00]: sign that said medical arts building,
and when I got older, I used to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: bus by that building, and I thought,
medical arts, isn't medicine science?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of art to this
practice of medicine, and particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to cannabis, because the
science is limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that a good doctor
can't practice in this regard,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have to kind of get a feel for
what you're doing and have a feel for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do, finally, ultimately make the ultimate
standard, the thing you'll have to answer
[SPEAKER_00]: to for the medical board in court,
whenever you have to ultimately answer to
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, what is the standard of care?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the standard of care is nothing 100%
set in stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what an expert in your field would
say it is, and what would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: agreed-upon standard of care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably most doctors know what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some intuitive level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get records for people that you're
gonna look into, you stay in contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you follow up, you make sure that
you don't over-recommend or
[SPEAKER_00]: over-prescribe, you don't ignore your
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm my grandmother telling me
what to do, but that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes for myself,
my standard is, what would my grandmother
[SPEAKER_00]: have said I should do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a pretty good standard,
and it probably works most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's common sense, but it
doesn't always, you know, in any
[SPEAKER_00]: particular situation, you just have to
take a step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I feel comfortable with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would I want someone to do for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would I expect others to do for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made it, 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Michael, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also the co-host of a podcast with
Chella, Cannabis Helps Dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she spoke to you last night about
Ryan's law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan's law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And RCFE's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And could you speak to Ryan's law in
California, and is it going to help us get
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis into RCFE's, or is it
specifically six months to live,
[SPEAKER_00]: hospice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the six months to live part,
I'm not... It is hospice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hospice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one year, actually,
is the... Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ryan's law is a law that says,
essentially, that the state passed a law
[SPEAKER_00]: that says that hospice care, hospice
providers are now required to allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of cannabis by patients who are in
hospice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't look up the time factor,
but I believe it is... If they are
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal, which means one year of
predicted life based on the current
[SPEAKER_00]: prognosis, the provider is required to
allow the use of it and to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol for how it's to be used and
distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other big requirement is no inhalation
of cannabis is allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no smoking and no vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to be orally consumed,
which means either an edible or an oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if someone's sick and in hospice care
in California, they almost certainly have
[SPEAKER_00]: a primary caregiver, which is someone who
cares for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the person who's going to be buying
it and bringing it to them, or finding it
[SPEAKER_00]: or growing it and bringing it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have to be allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd have to allow a primary caregiver
to bring it out of the premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: A primary caregiver is also someone who
administers it, which is there's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: legal definition of administering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than likely in this scenario,
if someone's pretty sick, it means putting
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the spoon and giving it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hospice personnel are not required to
store it or administer it, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: required to allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that's a pretty good
explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
