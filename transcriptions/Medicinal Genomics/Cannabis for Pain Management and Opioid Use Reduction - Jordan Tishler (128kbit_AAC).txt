[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jordan Tischler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a physician and I'm here to talk to
you guys a little bit about pain
[SPEAKER_00]: management and consequentially reducing
opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to take a moment to thank you all
for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that I've gotten
out of this conference in spades today has
[SPEAKER_00]: been the vast number of interested folks
and the astounding amount of research and
[SPEAKER_00]: development that's being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it really warms my heart as a
clinician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also like to take a moment to
thank Cortigen and Medicinal Genomics for
[SPEAKER_00]: putting on this kind of an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take a few seconds just to explain who
I am and why I'm here and blathering at
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a Harvard physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trained in internal medicine at the
Brigham Williams Hospital, which I think
[SPEAKER_00]: is that way from here, but I'm a little
turned around, and then spent the last 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years or so working as an emergency
physician for the VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can imagine, I became de facto a
bit of an expert on drug and alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least the acute presentation of that,
and really came to see an awful lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage done by subjects both legal and
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got me to thinking about cannabis as
a safer kind of medication to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: My talk today is going to be a little
different in that I'm actually going to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus almost exclusively on clinical
matters rather than on research because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain is a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why I'm staring at this
thing, and there's a monitor here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but pain is the number one presenting
complaint nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain is the number one complaint that
patients say we don't address well,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that stems from
that that we have to understand as
[SPEAKER_00]: clinicians and as researchers is the
problems that we're seeing nationally and
[SPEAKER_00]: even globally with opiate use are really a
demand side problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we have all of these
governmental missives that say we should
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe less, and doctors you'll be held
more accountable and you need to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the PMP and all this stuff, and that's
fine band-aids, but really the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: here is that we don't have a particularly
good way to meet the demand in a safe and
[SPEAKER_00]: effective manner, so enter cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand the scope of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, our current approaches don't
work that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at drug overdoses,
the current statistics are they kill more
[SPEAKER_00]: people than guns, cars, and falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, we have this opiate crisis
that we're addressing with major public
[SPEAKER_00]: health initiatives, but some of these
things I think might well also qualify.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we break it down, the problem here is
that we only have three alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three drug classes that we can
use to address pain unless, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at the Massachusetts DPH silly
initiative where they listed things like
[SPEAKER_00]: Lycinopril, which is a blood pressure
medication, but really when it comes down
[SPEAKER_00]: to it, we're talking about Tylenol,
which is in a class by itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we all know what that is good for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for some things, but it also is
not good for other things, and it has some
[SPEAKER_00]: attendant risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
medications like ibuprofen or Naprosyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work well for certain things and also
come with certain risks of GI bleeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: renal failure and those sorts of things
and not appropriate for all circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what's left?
[SPEAKER_00]: Opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of stuck unless we start to
talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the question is, what do we know
about opiates?
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that opiates have been with
us for so long that they haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderfully well studied, particularly
when it comes to chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last two, three years, we finally,
in the setting of this declared crisis,
[SPEAKER_00]: got around to looking at these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that opiates aren't that
great for chronic pain, and they come with
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of side effects from the obvious
addiction issues, but how about just
[SPEAKER_00]: constipation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody watch on television and there's
now a drug out that you can take so you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get constipated while you take your
opiates?
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of a children's rhyme,
but this is where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opiates are dangerous, duh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about you, but I've known
that forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had a long reputation of being
pretty stingy with opiates and getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of trouble in the early 2000s with
my superiors because, as you remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had these groups come in and talk about
pain is the fifth vital sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can come into the ED without being
interviewed about their level of pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: exit interviewed about whether they were
adequately the pain was adequately
[SPEAKER_00]: addressed and that put a lot of pressure
on us to write more scripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprisingly, we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know now is that when you look at
the number needed to harm, it's only 33.
[SPEAKER_00]: 33 patients, one in 33 patients walking
into your ED and you write a prescription,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to have trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to either become addicted or
worse yet die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not such a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may tell you about a success story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Teresa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, it isn't Teresa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not her name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not her photo, but oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about, go backwards,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful slide, but anyway, let's talk
about Teresa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There she is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teresa, whom I met in my clinic about two
years ago, maybe two and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really wants to show you the
endocannabinoid system, but we'll leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: there and maybe it'll stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: 42 years at the time that I met her,
she was a high-powered local attorney and
[SPEAKER_00]: she had had the misfortune of having a car
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the car accident, she developed two
long-term consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was she ended up with this weird
seizure, pseudo-seizure thing that was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on and nobody could quite put their
finger on what that was all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing, not surprisingly,
she had a lot of musculoskeletal damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was in a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I met her, she was at her
wit's end.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had taken time from her high-powered
job at great cost to her financially as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as emotionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was on a serious handful of oxycodone,
Percocet, every day, and tramadol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a drug I really dislike.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was being followed by her primary care
doctor and neurologist and a pain
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them knew what to do next with
her, nor did they know how to get her off
[SPEAKER_00]: the opiates because she was in so much
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, she was really
suffering from the side effects of the
[SPEAKER_00]: opiates as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make matters worse, this poor lady had
two young teenage daughters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The elder was an honor student whose
grades started to fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daughter ended up starting to use
illegal substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: The younger daughter developed an anxiety
disorder which then manifested itself in
[SPEAKER_00]: suicidality and ended up having to be
admitted to a local pediatric psychiatry
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life was not good when I met this woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we were able to do was to treat her
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We treated her pain with a mixture of
cannabis through various preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to come back to this a bunch of
times, but I like to think of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rubric with the analogy to the way
we use opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an uncomfortable analogy because
we're trying to avoid opiates,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the way we're taught to think about
these things is that we use a long-acting
[SPEAKER_00]: form of opiate to get baseline coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we use a short-acting form of opiate
to deal with breakthrough pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there is any, on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about cannabis,
and we've certainly heard lots and lots
[SPEAKER_00]: about different preparations and ways to
use, what we know is that anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: you take orally gets metabolized by the
liver and has a much longer half-life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a little bit erratic in its
onset, so that becomes some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then inhaled has a rapid onset and a
relatively short half-life so that that
[SPEAKER_00]: works well in that immediate sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the next six months, we were able to
titrate this to the point at which she was
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was no longer in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her mood came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was able to address family matters and
get her children the help that they
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, the interesting thing was even
though her other physicians were
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable with the idea of titrating
down her opiates for reasons that I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't understand even after having
multiple conversations with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient just did it herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, look, I feel okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She slowly weaned off the tram at all and
then next came off the Percocet.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 12 months, she was opiate-free and her
family was back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following her since.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's had some ups and downs, but the
principle is there and the success rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it in the nutshell, the success
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to now move on to this slide
about the endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_00]: really basically whiz past it because you
guys have heard so much about the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system in the last two
days that there's really not much for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's a complex signaling
pathway, that it has both receptor and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-receptor mediated ways of functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, what I haven't heard
a lot of discussion so far is the ways in
[SPEAKER_00]: which the endocannabinoid system interacts
with our inflammatory system around the
[SPEAKER_00]: prostaglandins and cytokines that are also
involved in pain perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you mention that yesterday?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are interesting bits about the way
the ECS works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works both peripherally and centrally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of really interesting
data coming out now about its peripheral
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide basically shows us that it's a
negative feedback loop so that when these
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotransmitters stimulate the
postsynaptic cell, then we get secretion
[SPEAKER_00]: of the endocannabinoids, typically
anandamide, which is complex then with
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1, and shut down the calcium influx
channels, thus shutting off this release
[SPEAKER_00]: of neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's fairly well understood
at this point, but the interesting bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about this is that we also get into
paracrine, meaning secretion of
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids from non-neuronal tissue
that are involved in supporting the neural
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, and then we also get, come on
slide, paracrine, whoa, come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really having trouble with the slides
today, apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paracrine function that affects
inflammatory cells that are also involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in tissue damage,
like histocytes and macrophages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a ton of processing going on at
all levels throughout this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the central nervous system,
we know that pain systems work both in an
[SPEAKER_00]: ascending, meaning it's going up to your
brain, but there's interestingly a shutoff
[SPEAKER_00]: system where the pain systems trigger down
again to turn off some of this and to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent a runaway cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there's more processing going
on there than we've previously thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that there are these neurons in the
spinal column, essentially here where the
[SPEAKER_00]: opioid receptor works, and that the CB1
receptor is tightly complex to that new
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor there, and again, is involved in
signals that then dampen this fetus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many, many ways that we can use
cannabis, as we've heard so much about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In clinical encounters, I typically start
by talking about smoking, not because I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend it, I really don't, for obvious
pulmonary health issues, but people
[SPEAKER_00]: understand where I'm starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, a little mood music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, I will recommend that we move
on to vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vaporizing avoids products of combustion,
but it provides an easy, repeatable dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: framework based on what I call puffs,
or you might all call hits, although I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that slang is a little painted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the following benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rapid onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get effects from it within five to 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it doesn't last that long,
which in many instances is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about pain today,
but in many instances where I'm treating
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's more like anxiety and
depression, it's nice to have something
[SPEAKER_00]: that has kind of a medium duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into things that you can take
by mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out, when you look at some of the
bioability studies, that edibles is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the places where the stoners got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That when you take cannabis in an oil form
or as a solid form or those sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, it's really poorly absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get about 30% absorption, whereas if
you take it in a brownie, you get about
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% or 100% better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still not great bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really impacts how we treat people
and the doses that they can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have to remember that patients are
not just whatever problem you're looking
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients are complex organisms,
just like you and me, where we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember the whole person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this in part as holistic
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all these patients that come to me
and they're elderly and they're obese,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they have type 2 diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week, I saw a young woman,
31 years old, had been a type 1 diabetic
[SPEAKER_00]: since she was 18 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was telling me that her blood A1 cell
C level, which is a measure of her glucose
[SPEAKER_00]: control, was 8.9 and that was the best
that she's ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just marveled at that, because that's
not a very good number.
[SPEAKER_00]: She came to me for intractable facial
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, I was not going to go tell her,
take two brownies and call me in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to work out something else there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip a lot of these other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've heard a lot about them,
except to mention this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that oil-based vaporizer pens
probably ought to burn in hell,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are filled with all kinds of
nasty things like polyethylene glycol or
[SPEAKER_00]: propylene glycol, which are dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing we want is to treat
somebody's pain and then have them have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lung transplant, because we gave them
popcorn lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is right for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a graphic pulled from the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologies to its creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just the question is framing the wrong
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue here is not which one is right
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how do we use these things properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not either or.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's complementary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I've slipped into doctor speak
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that people under PO means by
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our long acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then inhaled is rapid onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checking my time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I wanted to mention my
diabetic patient, but the point is I see
[SPEAKER_00]: this time and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this, and fortunately, we've heard
from a few speakers this week about the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries misguiding people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this a lot in my practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the areas where that comes up is
that they don't know medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know the patient's problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may send a patient in to get,
say, capsules of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they say, well, yeah, sure,
here, buy some capsules, but don't you
[SPEAKER_00]: want the chocolate bars, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the patient goes home and there's
blood sugar spikes, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to remember the whole patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also heard a lot about dosing,
and I think dosing is really crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know is that you start to get
benefit as you increase the dose,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's not really a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is more of a surprise is that you
turn a corner at some certain dose,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at that point, you don't really get
any more benefit, but you certainly get
[SPEAKER_00]: more side effect and risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: These side effects may be as minor as dry
mouth, which is something I can attest to
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment, not from cannabis,
but from speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also get things, particularly in the
elderly, like orthostatic hypotension,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can lead to falls and such like
that, as well as obviously increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are reasons why we do not want to
push too far past this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my practice, what I have found is that
a dose around 10 to 15 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes up to 20, and I guess this is
milligrams of THC component in a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: flour product, or whole flour,
really seems to be the sweet spot for
[SPEAKER_00]: almost the entire population.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is interesting to me, and this has
been mentioned by other speakers,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that there are really two populations
that come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are the cannabis naive folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never touched this stuff,
or I used it in the 60s when I was 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now I'm 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's this other group,
which is the smaller group in my practice
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point, which are people who are
coming to me already using and wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: either become legit, or they really have
realized that there's needs for best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that that group comes in using way
more than I would recommend to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it becomes a much more,
I think, difficult discussion to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: get them to ratchet it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they do, if they are willing to play
ball, I find they get much better benefit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they come back to me and say,
Doc, wow, I feel so much better,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm taking so much less, and I'm
saving money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, exactly, I told you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the goal, and what's not the goal
is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandma doing bong rips, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I'm two seconds from done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, assuming that this actually,
yep, whoops, no, come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, on here is how you reach
me if you want to ask me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more than happy to go over any of this
stuff with you guys, and somewhere up
[SPEAKER_00]: there is supposed to be the list of
references for this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, all right, forward one,
references.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you want to photograph that,
you can go to that link and find all
[SPEAKER_00]: manner of stuff that supports what I
actually just talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
