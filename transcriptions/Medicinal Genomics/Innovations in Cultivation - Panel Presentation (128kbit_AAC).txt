[SPEAKER_11]: So before we get going, I'll get the
panelists to all introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm John McKay from New West
Genetics in Fort Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're creating new varieties that are
high-yielding varieties for large-scale
[SPEAKER_05]: outdoor production and creating them from
a seed basis with certified seeds so that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's guaranteed that the crop does what we
say it does.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Allison Justice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm with ALCO, VP of Cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a vertically integrated cannabis
company in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a background in ornamental plant
production and research, PhD, plant
[SPEAKER_08]: science from Clemson University.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Dr. Mark Lewis, president of Napro
Research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a tech company focused in four key
sectors of the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: biotechnology, production, consumer
education, and laboratory services.
[SPEAKER_03]: The road down those sectors has led to the
creation of what is the most chemically
[SPEAKER_03]: diverse, stable, and well-characterized
germplasm collection in the world that
[SPEAKER_03]: consists of both award-winning genetics
for adult use and medical use,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also some say it's the most valuable
and robust intellectual property asset in
[SPEAKER_03]: the market today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm John Vaught.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the CEO and founder of Front Range
Biosciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a PhD in organic chemistry and just
gave a talk on what we do, but we do
[SPEAKER_04]: tissue culture propagation and clean stock
nursery programs and varietal development
[SPEAKER_04]: or plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, happy to be here and be a part of
the panel.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seth Crawford, make seeds and smell
plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: With the recent changes in the regulatory
structure, really all over the world,
[SPEAKER_11]: but more specifically within the US and
Canada, we've seen a big shift from
[SPEAKER_11]: small-scale cultivation to large and even,
you can call it, massive-scale cultivation
[SPEAKER_11]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, that's what I'd like to start with
is chatting a little bit about the impacts
[SPEAKER_11]: of that change.
[SPEAKER_11]: Specifically, John, maybe I could pose
this question to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are the impacts in terms of product
supply, product diversity, and the cost of
[SPEAKER_11]: production when it comes to that shift?
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly, the cost of production is
orders of magnitude lower in the field
[SPEAKER_05]: than indoor either warehouse or greenhouse
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, it creates a more stable supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's cheaper to produce, you can
actually overproduce like we do in every
[SPEAKER_05]: other agricultural industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Product diversity, I imagine, will
decrease.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what happened in other crops,
but I don't really have a good prediction
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: How about in terms of different types of
products?
[SPEAKER_11]: With the shift to mass production,
you find that there'll be... We have
[SPEAKER_11]: edibles, obviously.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have durable, sublingual.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you find or do you think that that
product line, so to speak, will extend?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the consumer demand is out there
for the diversified, extracted cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: products.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Colorado, as mentioned earlier,
it went from 100% flower to less than 30%
[SPEAKER_05]: at the retail level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are not using these products
because they're too expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it will create more consumer
demand to have a more affordable
[SPEAKER_05]: feedstock.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess moving on from that, Mark,
perhaps I could pose this question to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you find that with the shift from small
scale to large scale, we're focusing more
[SPEAKER_11]: strategically on specific areas of
innovation, given perhaps more resources
[SPEAKER_11]: directed towards these initiatives?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see innovation being key in both
creating innovation in innovative new
[SPEAKER_03]: products and then also taking those
innovative products to scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Innovation is required in both situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Seth pointed it out quite clearly
with their seed production, being
[SPEAKER_03]: innovative on a particular product and
then being able to take it to scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the regulatory environment kind of
changing the way it has, we see our
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbors to the north innovating,
shifting from the big in-mine grows to
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor grows to big greenhouse ranges now,
showing that innovation that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: South of the border, we see innovation in
individual products, whether it's creating
[SPEAKER_03]: stable homozygous seed that are chemically
unique and diverse in the marketplace,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe have certain ratios of THC to CBD
and certain terpene profiles and or those
[SPEAKER_03]: particular products that get turned into
your sauces and distillates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's on a more smaller scale,
but it's still innovation nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking a unique product or genotype to
scale requires seed production and our
[SPEAKER_03]: humble opinion because there are certain
hurdles associated with asexual
[SPEAKER_03]: propagation that John pointed out,
hence his desire to use tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: We find that at the end of the day,
the most innovative way to get to your
[SPEAKER_03]: goal of having a mass scale product is not
necessarily what environments you create,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's how robust and stable the seed is
that you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: At Napro, we're one of the few groups like
Seth who's taken the time to create
[SPEAKER_03]: parental lines that breed nice,
stable, chemically and morphologically
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take a unique ratio of THC to CBD
or CBD to CBG to scale.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great points and completely agree there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess related to this issue that you
just posed, what is the potential,
[SPEAKER_11]: and this is a question for Seth and John
Vought, please, what is the potential for
[SPEAKER_11]: disease spread?
[SPEAKER_11]: Massive crop loss and whole varietal loss
as a result of this large scale system
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're entering today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of risk with a new
crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned in my talk a little bit
earlier, I think we're setting ourselves
[SPEAKER_04]: up for some potential viral outbreaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly think that improper use of
vegetative propagation and asexual
[SPEAKER_04]: reproduction as just mentioned here can
certainly lead to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of challenges though with
seed production.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my two colleagues here just
definitely pointed out the amount of time
[SPEAKER_04]: and work that it goes into creating stable
seed and it's something that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: certainly working on as well because I
think there is a ton of value there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the big challenge with disease is
that as you really scale up, your risk of
[SPEAKER_04]: loss becomes much more significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a small producer, yeah,
it can hurt you, but it's not the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you get to larger and larger scales,
if you're a $100 million revenue company
[SPEAKER_04]: and you lose potentially $20 million of
revenue due to crop loss, you have a real
[SPEAKER_04]: problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to take a variety of
different strategies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not only the genetics and the
beginning of the plant but it's how you
[SPEAKER_04]: grow them, it's where they're grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think certainly there's going to be
geographic regions that are particularly
[SPEAKER_04]: useful to grow certain varieties where
they don't necessarily get exposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: specific diseases or they're not suffering
from some of those problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think strong IPM or integrated pest
management programs, especially in the
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse, is going to be very,
very important to help to prevent these
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Add on just a touch to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the main issues that I think we see
is different requirements.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're trying to produce, say,
a trim flower for the consumer market,
[SPEAKER_06]: you need to have uniformity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uniformity is your greatest nemesis when
it comes to trying to get around plant
[SPEAKER_06]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have clean plant stock,
but if all the plants are the same and
[SPEAKER_06]: you're hit by the same particular pathogen
that's going to wipe them all out,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to lose everything you have.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we've seen in terms of field
production is that if you have very
[SPEAKER_06]: healthy plants and some diversity still
left in that population, they're much more
[SPEAKER_06]: likely to be able to bounce back if they
are hit by some sort of outbreak.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also seen that outdoor production is
much, much less prone when you have
[SPEAKER_06]: healthy F1 hybrids to some of these
disease outbreaks, but at the same time
[SPEAKER_06]: you lose the ability to control and have
that uniform product at the end of the
[SPEAKER_06]: day.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's different problems that people
face depending on your production
[SPEAKER_06]: environment and your in-production goals.
[SPEAKER_11]: John, how about the idea of genetic
banking for some of these highly sought
[SPEAKER_11]: after varieties?
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of any breeding program, you have to
have your parental lines, your different
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrid lines, your progeny, all of the
ones that Seth so wonderfully described in
[SPEAKER_04]: his talk just a few minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have ways to store and
propagate those, characterize them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of value in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you get to truly stable breeding lines
and parental lines, the ability to store
[SPEAKER_04]: and seed is certainly a great way to do
things as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you look at certain crops,
a lot of them you can maintain them in a
[SPEAKER_04]: clean stock program, in a nursery setting,
and you have specific male and female
[SPEAKER_04]: lines that you can cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Effectively, to make these F1 hybrids and
being able to store and maintain those in
[SPEAKER_04]: a disease-free environment that's sterile
and be able to produce those combinations
[SPEAKER_04]: reproducibly over and over again is really
part of a good breeding program from our
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely lots of challenges ahead,
but it sounds like we have a number of
[SPEAKER_11]: different tools to deal with them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Allison, I'm hoping maybe you could
discuss a little bit about what the
[SPEAKER_11]: implications of some of these challenges
are on potentially product quality and
[SPEAKER_11]: also things like environmental
stewardship.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of people associate quality
and mass scale to be opposites.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't actually correlate the two.
[SPEAKER_08]: In California, I think we're going to have
this misconception as we increase our
[SPEAKER_08]: licenses that we give out, growers that
are used to growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 lights are running to go get 100 acres,
and they're wanting to grow that very
[SPEAKER_08]: fast, and they're not ready for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that it can't be done
successfully.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that those protocols hadn't been set
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think early on, in California at least,
we're going to have big growers come on,
[SPEAKER_08]: and we're going to see poor quality,
but it's not necessarily because it can't
[SPEAKER_08]: be done.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be because we're rushing to
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as being environmentally
sustainable, I think regulations is going
[SPEAKER_08]: to be huge for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: In California, for 20 plus years,
there's been many, many black market
[SPEAKER_08]: growers that are doing whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Vaught was just saying that 80% of the
cannabis submitted to Steep Hill is
[SPEAKER_08]: failing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's just the people that actually
want to submit to get a pesticide test.
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about the ones that aren't doing
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Having the EPA, the Department of Ag all
involved and controlling or supporting and
[SPEAKER_08]: giving us regulations on what to do with
pesticides and fertilizers I think is a
[SPEAKER_08]: great thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: As we grow, not necessarily individual
farms grow in size, but as we grow as a
[SPEAKER_08]: legal market, bringing in the science I
think will be absolutely more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a very diverse group here in that
we all need to pursue indoor cultivation,
[SPEAKER_11]: outdoor cultivation, or perhaps a
combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'd like to transition to
discuss at this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Essentially, are there differences,
I guess, or similarities between the two
[SPEAKER_11]: different cultivation systems,
indoor versus outdoor?
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps John and McKay, you can elaborate
on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in terms of breeding targets,
for indoor versus outdoor, there's some
[SPEAKER_05]: overlap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, yield and specific cannabinoid
profiles are going to be shared there.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we heard earlier, the disease pressure
is going to differ quite a bit between
[SPEAKER_05]: indoor and outdoor production,
as well as outdoor production across
[SPEAKER_05]: different production environments,
different geographies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what's different is on the outdoor
production side, if you're talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of acres, you have to have plant
types that are mechanically harvestable.
[SPEAKER_05]: The manual labor approach doesn't scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas in indoor, I think people will
still be getting away with more
[SPEAKER_05]: labor-intensive production systems and
turning crops over more.
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking strictly propagation,
John Vought, perhaps you can elaborate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you see there being a difference
between propagation mechanisms employed
[SPEAKER_11]: for outdoor versus indoor?
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you had showed us a slide where you
had a bunch of tissue culture plantlets
[SPEAKER_11]: outside, growing to maturity.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just wondering if you think there
would be a difference there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day, it all boils down
to economics.
[SPEAKER_04]: As it does with every crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tissue culture is really just one tool in
the toolbox that we use to support clean,
[SPEAKER_04]: healthy, vigorous plants and uniformity as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to the different growing
methodologies, indoor versus outdoor,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think once again, it boils down to cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ability to grow hundreds or thousands
of acres of a plant at a few dollars per
[SPEAKER_04]: plant or even tens of dollars per acre
compared to growing in greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_04]: you start to see the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at indoor growing,
which can cost hundreds of dollars per
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, the numbers get quite staggering.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's challenges involved with each of
those growing environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got certainly outdoors,
you're not going to be able to keep pests
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get a massive pest invasion that's
carrying some type of virus or disease,
[SPEAKER_04]: you could have a real problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have the same thing in a
greenhouse, but if it's a well-controlled
[SPEAKER_04]: environment greenhouse, you can minimize
some of that risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when it comes to propagation,
I think there's advantages for both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until we have more folks like Seth and
some of the work they're doing on
[SPEAKER_04]: stabilized seed and John up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of us are working actually on similar
programs for breeding until we can truly
[SPEAKER_04]: scale that and we can meet all of the
different profiles that we need for all
[SPEAKER_04]: the different geographic regions and we
have really stable seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe that asexual reproduction and
cloning and propagation is a way to put
[SPEAKER_04]: uniform crops out into the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's done right, they can be clean and
healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's certainly differences in vigor
between plants that come from clones
[SPEAKER_04]: versus plants that come from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no doubt that seed has the most
vigor when compared directly to asexual
[SPEAKER_04]: reproduction, but if you don't have
uniformity in your crop, it can be a
[SPEAKER_04]: regulatory risk if you're talking about
hemp and you're trying to minimize your
[SPEAKER_04]: THC production.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you might hear from some groups who
have planted seed, depending on where they
[SPEAKER_04]: got it from, you see a lot of variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: With modern mechanization, you can use
transplants, whether they come from
[SPEAKER_04]: seedlings or clones or young plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use automated transplanters to
plant pretty large acreages.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as cheap as planting seed,
but it certainly gives you the uniformity.
[SPEAKER_04]: In greenhouse, there's certainly reasons
to use clean plants out of a nursery such
[SPEAKER_04]: as ours as well because you can maintain
cleanliness and you know what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: getting time after time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can turn your cycles in your
greenhouse very, very quickly that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's reasons to use all of the
different approaches that we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it really boils down to what your
target product is, what your cost of
[SPEAKER_04]: production is, what geography you're in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, growing outdoors in some
climates may not be such a good idea,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially with climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of risk with some of the
storm patterns that we see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it really boils down to where
you're at and what you're goals are.
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of propagation from seed,
there's the ability to do feminized seed,
[SPEAKER_11]: obviously 100% or close to female seed,
but there's also the possibility of
[SPEAKER_11]: hermaphroditism within some of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Seth, I'm hoping you can elaborate what
the impacts of pollen transfer in an
[SPEAKER_11]: indoor versus an outdoor cultivation
system may be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, forget about disease and pests.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're concerned about the quality of
your product and you're growing outside,
[SPEAKER_06]: your main problem is going to be pollen
coming from people who don't know what
[SPEAKER_06]: they're doing, period.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether it's their fault for not knowing
what they're doing or unsavory characters
[SPEAKER_06]: selling seed that's not necessarily all
female.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you're doing a good job,
hermaphrodites do happen in any given
[SPEAKER_06]: population.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's genetically determined,
and in other cases, more often,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's environmentally influenced.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have clones growing in the same
field, and if you end up having a vole go
[SPEAKER_06]: out and girdle the plant, it might sprout
male flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it doesn't get the right amount of
water because there's a plug in your drip
[SPEAKER_06]: tape, it might sprout male flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a million different reasons why
that could potentially happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pollen is pernicious, especially when you
start getting it in dense concentrations.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some really good research.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Spain, it happened in the late 80s
through the early 90s, where they were
[SPEAKER_06]: tracking pollen dispersal from Morocco,
where hash production using male and
[SPEAKER_06]: female seed was the norm.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was two plantings that happened
consistently in Morocco, early and late.
[SPEAKER_06]: They could track when those plantings were
happening and when the plants were
[SPEAKER_06]: finishing up based on the pollen travel,
which went across the Serre de Gibraltar
[SPEAKER_06]: and went as much as 250 miles inland into
Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been suffering huge setbacks in
Oregon for the last four years because of
[SPEAKER_06]: this, and would encourage anybody who has
industrial hemp programs, obviously talk
[SPEAKER_06]: of this in California as well,
to make sure there is at least some sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of requirement that farmers know what type
of seed they're planting, have some
[SPEAKER_06]: verification that it is actually
feminized, although there's also problems
[SPEAKER_06]: that go along with that, too, as we saw.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some plants are male and phenotypically
phenotype, but have 2X chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely an issue, and it's
something to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any legal implications in any of
these regions as a result of this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Very much so, although right now we're
looking at areas of legal theory on
[SPEAKER_06]: trespass and essentially economic
deprivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're looking at is a farmer in
Oregon, there is case law that supports
[SPEAKER_06]: this using smoke from fires as some sort
of trespass from one property to the next.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're actually investigating that as a
potential legal tool to dissuade farmers
[SPEAKER_06]: from growing cheaper male and female seed
who don't understand that it's more
[SPEAKER_06]: problematic and causes irreparable harm to
your neighbors, just for the benefit of
[SPEAKER_06]: getting a slightly cheaper seed.
[SPEAKER_11]: In an indoor production system,
is there any downside to it?
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's not as large, I would
imagine.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of the implications for somebody?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not as big.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you think about the impact that one
male plant can have in a field if it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: properly dealt with, what we've seen is
that one male plant can pollinate,
[SPEAKER_06]: and you'll see a concentric circle
essentially around it following wind
[SPEAKER_06]: patterns, but you'll have an acre of
seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you have a seeded plant, you're
losing approximately 50% of your usable
[SPEAKER_06]: biomass and 30% of your total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have good data on this because it
happens to us regularly.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we don't make seed outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: We only make it inside very controlled
environments with lots of filters.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thanks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, speaking indoor versus outdoor,
Allison and Mark, I'm hoping to pose this
[SPEAKER_11]: question to you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: How does this shift in the focus on
production of high-margin products such as
[SPEAKER_11]: organics differ between those two
cultivation systems?
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I love this question because it
makes you beg the question, what's the
[SPEAKER_03]: definition of high-margin?
[SPEAKER_03]: High-margin is defined by being
innovative, protected, and distinct from
[SPEAKER_03]: what else is in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Organic will help you do that,
but then it just comes down to a resource
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indoor obviously is going to be more
electrical and lighting, but in
[SPEAKER_03]: California, we get half a million joules
of sunlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's carbon emission-free, no bill from
Mother Nature for that light.
[SPEAKER_03]: That helps on the margin side,
but the true way to keep those margins up
[SPEAKER_03]: is by, for example, using award-winning
genetics that people truly love in the
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace that are different chemically
that make you have a specific experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon Crush is a great example of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won the Emerald Cup last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The farmer growing it happened to be
selecting it specifically for botrytis
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, what do you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very tolerant to botrytis and
maintains structure across the entire seed
[SPEAKER_03]: crop, but more importantly, it had
delicious flavor and imparted an
[SPEAKER_03]: experience that was unique and novel in
the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: That same grower produced something called
guava jam, also very innovative.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one-to-one CBDV to CBD, and it had
about 0.3% THC, but all of the users
[SPEAKER_03]: explained it, give them effect somewhere
between caffeine and nicotine without the
[SPEAKER_03]: jitters, and it totally wiped out their
appetite.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the type of innovation that can
truly kind of shape a high-margin product
[SPEAKER_03]: because then you have this whole new
market segment opened up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always like to say that the largest,
when I give talks, I bait the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say, who in here thinks they know who
the largest demographic of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: smokers is?
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody will say, baby boomers or
young kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's those who haven't used it yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the market we're going for,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of how we kind of strive
to do that innovation work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always ask, what if?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we reduce our costs to increase the
margins?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you always go towards agriculture?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was rooted in 4-H as a kid,
so when I saw people buying jugs of liquid
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients at the store, I was like,
just take some scots and put it in water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing, and you're not paying
for the shipping costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's very crazy the way that
prohibition took this marketplace into the
[SPEAKER_03]: dark ages, but now I'm glad to see we're
coming out of them, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm absolutely with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Genetics is a huge thing, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But second, coming from ornamentals where
there's 100-acre greenhouses, and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: grown from cuts shipped from Guatemala,
and the input per plant is very low.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the cannabis industry as a whole,
whether it's outdoor or indoor,
[SPEAKER_08]: we've got to get this cost of goods sold
way down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Indoor, outdoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Outdoor's got a little more leeway just
because the price per pound, you don't
[SPEAKER_08]: have to pay for the sun.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's already pretty low, but indoor,
the cost people are putting in just on the
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation side per pound is pretty
outrageous.
[SPEAKER_08]: At our indoor facility, we use LEDs,
so right there, we're already saving 40%
[SPEAKER_08]: and lighting costs.
[SPEAKER_08]: We mix our own nutrients, so compared to
some of the other bottled nutrients,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's about 24 times less the cost.
[SPEAKER_08]: That still is about $400 per pound to
produce, and that is absolutely
[SPEAKER_08]: outrageous, especially if you're thinking
about poor Oregon up there that's getting
[SPEAKER_08]: $400 or $500 a pound.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not making any money, and the $400
is not including any taxes, any
[SPEAKER_08]: post-harvest trimming or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever else you want to throw on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what we've really got to do is be
innovative.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to bring science in.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the practices that growers
specifically indoor are doing,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're not doing it from science.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the science that can be applied,
maybe you don't need as much light,
[SPEAKER_08]: so maybe you can cut down that price.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've just got to get our cost of goods
down, bring in the science.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that the competition's going
to get much more stiff, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, the winners,
they're going to be the ones holding the
[SPEAKER_03]: distinct, unique, and protected genetics
that produce the products that maintain
[SPEAKER_03]: those margins.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, a focus on genetics, but also
bringing in all of these other aspects of
[SPEAKER_11]: science, so from lighting to other
cultivation-based businesses, and coupling
[SPEAKER_11]: all that together to make it work for you,
regardless of whether it's indoor or
[SPEAKER_11]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to switch gears a little bit and
talk a little bit about breeding.
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, there's, I guess, two main avenues
if you're conducting any type of cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: breeding, and that's breeding for flower
or breeding with the end goal of
[SPEAKER_11]: extraction and derivative products.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to, I guess, pose this question
to Mark, Seth, and John, please.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there differences in breeding
strategies and the traits you're seeking
[SPEAKER_11]: in these breeding programs, depending on
one of those end goals?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead and jump off if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: The extraction versus flower thing is
critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do time course on hundreds of different
varietals, and some will peak in oil and
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid production day 35 or 40 by
weight mass, and if you were extracting,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd want that, but if you wanted the
uniformity in the product, like Seth was
[SPEAKER_03]: talking for the bag appeal for the flower,
you need the flower to actually fill in
[SPEAKER_03]: and become full, which sometimes takes
upwards of 60 or 70 days, and the
[SPEAKER_03]: interplay between your cannabinoid ratios
changes throughout that time course as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, as does the locking in of your
terpene cassette or your final nose,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's just important for everybody to
remember that everything is a trait,
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of them can be isolated and
exploited and used to create these
[SPEAKER_03]: products that are designed for either
extraction or flower flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Seth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much to deal with there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just thinking about one of the
experiments that we conducted this past
[SPEAKER_06]: summer was using day neutral plants,
auto flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the main issues that we have with
dealing with tons of biomass at a time is
[SPEAKER_06]: how in the hell do you dry it all?
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a lot of space, a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_06]: In general, if you're trying to grow
outdoor trim flower tops, you're looking
[SPEAKER_06]: at basically two acres can fit in a 5,000
square foot space.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted to get to the point where we
could reduce the price of biomass,
[SPEAKER_06]: but at the same time also have a robust
terpene profile still available for a
[SPEAKER_06]: quote unquote full spectrum oil
extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had no idea what was going to happen
when we cut plants down in the middle of
[SPEAKER_06]: August and laid them on black plastic in
the sun when it was 90 degrees outside,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we expected that a lot of the terpenes
would vaporize.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shocker, they did, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But some didn't, and the terpene fraction
the relative constituent elements of that
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene fraction changed in very
interesting ways, which made us think,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, if we could target those specific
terpenes and get rid of some of these
[SPEAKER_06]: other ones, we could maybe have a much
more stable product using this particular
[SPEAKER_06]: approach.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of structure, yeah, there's a lot
of different breeding that goes into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you're going to see is that hybrids
tend to have the most in terms of overall
[SPEAKER_06]: yield and bag of peat ... Excuse me,
not bag of peal, but just yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're much more prolific in terms of
flower production, but at the same time
[SPEAKER_06]: their cannabinoid concentrations don't
tend to be as high.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's three different things that you
want and you get to pick two.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a truism in life.
[SPEAKER_11]: When we're talking terpenes, is it always
the goal to have a full spectrum extracted
[SPEAKER_11]: product, or do you maybe want to remove
those terpenes at some point?
[SPEAKER_06]: When we're trying to adapt for large scale
combines, if you've touched cannabis with
[SPEAKER_06]: lots of terpenes and lots of cannabinoids,
they're sticky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Combines don't like stickiness and they
gum up after about 20 feet in a field if
[SPEAKER_06]: you have a really nice crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: We specifically targeted plants that had
no terpenes, down to 0.2% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not because I believe in it, I don't think
it's the right approach in terms of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis as a medicine going forward,
but people do want to make isolate and
[SPEAKER_06]: they do want to machine harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are now apparently somebody invented
plants that don't have any cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_06]: and you could just extract the terpenes
and recombine them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Having a terpene free plant will allow you
to be able to harvest thousands of acres.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is potentially a good option to do
something like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things, one of our challenges
is all of the different producers in
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado are using different approaches to
go from a standing crop to either an
[SPEAKER_05]: extract or a sellable dried product.
[SPEAKER_05]: From a breeding perspective, there's
actually going to be an optimum idiot type
[SPEAKER_05]: for each of those, but we don't know which
one of those is going to become the ... Or
[SPEAKER_05]: if any of them, there may be some other
approach that becomes the standard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, for any given pipeline of
processing, you can increase the harvest
[SPEAKER_05]: index, so the percent of the biomass that
is actually useful for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas on the flower side, that's a
different approach where you're taking a
[SPEAKER_05]: very small percentage of the plant that
has the features that you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even more so than that, the structure of
the trichome is specific per application
[SPEAKER_03]: because some people in the world prefer
more natural products like mechanically
[SPEAKER_03]: extracted trichome heads versus a solvent
extracted cannabinoid fraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeding plants that have heads a certain
size and a certain stock length that
[SPEAKER_03]: really work well in a cured or a cured
resin type dry sift is also a way to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: get really high quality, really high
margin items because if you get just those
[SPEAKER_03]: trichome heads in there and they're chock
full of that goodness that we all know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they call that 100 meter hash because it
doesn't get further away from the grow it
[SPEAKER_03]: was grown at than 100 meters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: How about other aspects of plant
morphology catered more towards maybe the
[SPEAKER_11]: labor involved in plant maintenance?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there differences between outdoor or
not outdoor but rather breeding for flower
[SPEAKER_11]: versus extraction?
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed versus clone, there's a huge
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seed has a blueprint where it creates
its architecture so you don't have to do
[SPEAKER_03]: all that extra horticulture that's
associated with adventitious bud shoots on
[SPEAKER_03]: asexually propagated plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually breed plants to not have
adventitious shoots.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lines that we've messed with that
only have sets on their main branches and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no adventitious branching at all
which really minimizes your labor in the
[SPEAKER_03]: field because most of our clients are in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some in indoor still but the greenhouse is
where the labor becomes difficult
[SPEAKER_03]: especially when the things planted wall to
wall or you have a roll in bench system
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's difficult to get in and out of
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want those vectors for disease,
number one, but you also want the plant to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to execute the way it was designed
in its DNA to execute without stress.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Allison or John, do you have anything to
add to that topic?
[SPEAKER_05]: The lack of reducing branchiness is
definitely a feature for mechanical
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's been done in every other
crop species that's been domesticated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Combines don't like terpene resin and they
don't like branchiness.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think indoor the future there is
controlled environment, LEDs, very
[SPEAKER_08]: automated systems and whereas outdoor not
having to pinch and train is a great thing
[SPEAKER_08]: because the sun has a very deep photon
reach, LEDs do not.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want your plants very compact.
[SPEAKER_08]: There could be a way to do that by seed
but at least today and what I've
[SPEAKER_08]: experienced personally, vegetative cuts
are the easiest way to achieve that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think even aside from extraction versus
flower, the traits you're going after
[SPEAKER_11]: really depend on where you're actually
planning on growing those plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're doing something in South America
versus Canada, there is quite a difference
[SPEAKER_11]: between things you may want to go after
such as cold tolerance versus drought
[SPEAKER_11]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a very interesting
conversation and it's going to be an ever
[SPEAKER_11]: evolving one as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: With that, I think let's give a round of
applause to all our panelists.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have about three minutes or so for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so many questions but I'll only ask
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The harvest obviously is an issue but
somebody planted 1,500 acres or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were those bushy plants or they were?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you guys use donegros harvesting
equipment out of Europe for that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't do stuff like that because it's
crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so much labor.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a 63-acre R&D farm and that's
plenty.
[SPEAKER_06]: These folks used a corn harvester and
literally just came in grounded up and
[SPEAKER_06]: then used hop dryers to dry the resulting
biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the stem and stalk get kicked out
the back with the exception of really,
[SPEAKER_06]: really big stalks.
[SPEAKER_06]: They break combines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we had the problem with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody had any success with equipment
for harvesting other than that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's been the most successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually hoping to ask you guys went
over indoor versus outdoor cultivation but
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing that I didn't see touched on was
that the environment obviously changes the
[SPEAKER_02]: expression for the terpenes and the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody mentioned a CBG plant that was
from Cologne yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: What variation are you saying I've noticed
from my own cultivation and GW's
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments and others that indoor plants
don't express the cannabinoids and terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: ratios that you see in outdoor cultivation
so might outdoor be better for getting
[SPEAKER_02]: more unique and diverse plant groups?
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave a talk at CanMed in 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at just these factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light is the big one obviously because
outside light falls off exponentially with
[SPEAKER_03]: distance and we're so far away from the
sun that the little six feet doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really matter but inside a grow room where
you have a light bulb or an LED,
[SPEAKER_03]: as Allison said, the light falls off
exponentially pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impact number one with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at seed and if you have a
chemically stable varietal, then that
[SPEAKER_03]: chemically stable varietal, as I've shown
in my talk, is actually more stable than
[SPEAKER_03]: an asexually propagated clone over
multiple, multiple lots.
[SPEAKER_02]: That same clone grown in indoor versus
grown in greenhouse versus grown outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: will express differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indoor greenhouse and outdoor actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were like 87 different lots of it
across four different environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was when we were trying to define the
classification system based on terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profile and cannabinoid profile and the
difficulty with that was that these
[SPEAKER_03]: genotypes, like you said, express
differently in different environments and
[SPEAKER_03]: any time you stress them, they have a
tendency to become more myrcine dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: and any time you give them a lot of light,
they have a tendency to go towards the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes that they don't normally,
wouldn't produce in a stress situation in
[SPEAKER_03]: our experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been actually studying that and
finding it's abscisic acid, jasmonic acid
[SPEAKER_02]: and salicylic acid that are being
generated by those different stresses
[SPEAKER_02]: which is creating that terpene variation
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you looked at anything like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: We started to years ago but that became
just too many irons in the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to link up with you and talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really quick one thing to add to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the tissue culture lab, we've virtually
wiped out the microbiome in a plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: cleaned it and then re-inoculated with
different things and we've actually seen
[SPEAKER_04]: changes in cannabinoid expression and
other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of forces at work
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Mark mentioned light is obviously
huge and wavelength and photoperiod and
[SPEAKER_04]: then there's the genotype of the actual
plant and then you've got the microbiome
[SPEAKER_04]: and your soil and your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I can see in the work that we've
done and the data we've got is that all of
[SPEAKER_04]: these factors really can play into
cannabinoid expression, terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's highly variable at this stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're interested in this topic,
I highly encourage you to check out the
[SPEAKER_03]: 2016 CanMed talk because we compared
conventional nutrients versus organic and
[SPEAKER_03]: all those different things to mess with
the biome to see that exact change.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabinoid profile is pretty robust.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't change as much with the
environment but the terpene profile is
[SPEAKER_03]: very open to epigenetic influences for
sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Manny and we're Bird Valley
Organics.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a licensed cultivation facility
and distribution in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: We grow everything in Hugo beds and so we
have a very big biodiversity going on
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen anybody really advocate on
organic cultivation and I kind of was
[SPEAKER_09]: wondering why.
[SPEAKER_09]: Commercial production I hear, I know that
everybody's talking about numbers and
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody's talking about margins and
stuff like that but we're spending about
[SPEAKER_09]: $44 per pound on our facility.
[SPEAKER_09]: We make most of our nutrients from
scratch.
[SPEAKER_09]: We use companion planting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody has a role within the Hugo bed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Soil food web techniques.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know on a commercial level it's very,
very hard to do but also like when it
[SPEAKER_09]: comes to battling pests, battling disease,
you know, you can't really get a stronger
[SPEAKER_09]: plant I feel unless you have a good soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a client in Salinas, molecular
farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're 100% organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They build their own soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow cover crops, turn it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually less expensive than
conventional except for when it becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering time and you have to pay for all
those beneficials then it gets rather,
[SPEAKER_03]: rather costly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those predator wasps and ladybugs ain't
cheap to cover acres.
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends because if you're getting
ladybugs you're not really doing much
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ladybugs are generalists.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to go more for like, you know,
specific mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have banker plants and all that stuff
too so you're hoping to cultivate active
[SPEAKER_03]: communities of your insect population,
your beneficials, especially you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they use pepper plants and begonias to do
their predator mites and they hang them
[SPEAKER_03]: over their plants in the trust supports in
the greenhouse and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of the plant components after
harvest and all of that stuff get
[SPEAKER_03]: composted and then that compost
reconstituted into the soil so it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: they really try to focus on having a zero
waste sort of system as far as the biomass
[SPEAKER_03]: is concerned because that organic material
is essentially what that biome is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: feed off of and if you keep nourishing it,
it will be healthy and the plant will be
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy too.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's amazing is in that soil,
it's like two days after harvest and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can just pull the stalk out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The roots are completely chewed up by all
of the mycorrhizae and the active biome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard a lot about tissue culture and
about seed propagation but I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody's looked into synthetic seed and
if anything has been done on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: One step better.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a combination of seed, true F1,
from seed and tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's haploid production.
[SPEAKER_06]: You take a little bit of pollen from a
single female if you like to just use
[SPEAKER_06]: females like we do and you drop it into
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about the timing but you end up
with a plant that only has one chromosome.
[SPEAKER_06]: You double that by mutating it with the
mutagen and you end up with two copies of
[SPEAKER_06]: the same chromosome.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you use the same traditional plant
breeding techniques that I was describing
[SPEAKER_06]: before, you end up with a true,
essentially from clone, it'd be the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing as plants from tissue culture
but using a combination of those two
[SPEAKER_06]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That last comment was very revealing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've noticed that you're talking about the
feminized inbreeding to environmentally
[SPEAKER_07]: acclimate or stabilize the plants
genetically.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have either of you had problems with too
many generations because of inbreeding
[SPEAKER_07]: depression and losing desirable traits or
how many generations have you been able to
[SPEAKER_07]: go?
[SPEAKER_07]: How long does it take to stabilize a
plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry for having more than one part.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you get 100% homozygous or 100%
stable?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to hear from everybody else too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen plants become infertile at the
second generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen plants become infertile at the
sixth or seventh generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a tendency, at least from what
we've seen on the THC side, plants seem to
[SPEAKER_06]: be fertile for more generations of
inbreeding compared to the CBD or CBG
[SPEAKER_06]: side.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, cannabis is an obligate out-crosser
and I just don't see it unless you're
[SPEAKER_06]: using haploids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see a way of getting to truly
homozygous plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll get close for many of your traits
but I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get homozygous across multiple
traits but not all, like you said,
[SPEAKER_03]: two out of three ain't bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until we find a really good inducer line
like he's talking about for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to be a challenge to get those.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, it's about making
products for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to consider what they want and if
it's an asexually propagated thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a quick comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the things that we're
hearing up here is there's different ways
[SPEAKER_04]: to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the thing to keep in mind is
breeding does take a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does take a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's challenges with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This plant presents some unique challenges
but some challenges have been solved in
[SPEAKER_04]: other crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our position is that it's really a
combination of all these tools that are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to help solve this supply chain
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the nice thing about asexual
reproduction is that you can identify a
[SPEAKER_04]: unique variety and as soon as you do,
you can mass produce it very quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the fastest way to deploy a new
variety to market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, over time, is you want to get to
stable breeding lines and get seed
[SPEAKER_04]: products out because seed is much easier
as a product to manage, sell, distribute.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are certainly advantages when you go
to large scale outdoor production of using
[SPEAKER_04]: seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really a combination of all
of these technologies to help deal with
[SPEAKER_04]: this rapidly growing industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark, you hit the nail on the head
earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: The largest demographic is the 90% of the
world's population that never really uses

[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they're going to be taking
bong hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they're going to be smoking
blunts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going to be taking well
formulated tinctures and nutraceuticals
[SPEAKER_04]: and things that people are familiar and
comfortable with and can be safe.

combination of these different approaches
[SPEAKER_04]: to achieve those economics that allow us

[SPEAKER_04]: coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: To answer your question, in our

[SPEAKER_03]: Some things can go down the road a little

[SPEAKER_03]: Some things produce pollen better than
others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things that seed better than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's a trait, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
