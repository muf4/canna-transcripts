[SPEAKER_00]: But could it be something that,
you know, growers sort of, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd be an extra revenue stream for them,
that they could be providing that waste
[SPEAKER_00]: material to your company or whoever's
going to develop this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dream is to get extra revenue for
growers, get a safe bio pesticide for
[SPEAKER_01]: producers, and you know, expand this
because, you know, if you have something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is naturally broken down by
whatever's in the environment on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, in the soil, and that type of
thing, these natural products are broken
[SPEAKER_01]: down easily, more easily than synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so you have something that's
environmentally friendly, you have
[SPEAKER_01]: something that growers get an extra
revenue stream from, and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have all of those three things,
you've got kind of the pillars of
[SPEAKER_01]: developing a bio pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where are we at in terms of sort of
evaluating whether it works or actually
[SPEAKER_00]: getting to market?
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of where are you at there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm hoping that the interest from
CanMed will bring people around that want
[SPEAKER_01]: to invest in it, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would love to see this go into a
company and develop this technology so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it can be available to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is sort of the... How do you
get something like this approved?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the sort of agencies that dictate
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's EPA and there are rules for bio
pesticides for developing those that are
[SPEAKER_01]: less stringent than those for synthetics,
because most of those things are natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would go through the EPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would then, you know, we would tell
them everything that's in ours and how it
[SPEAKER_01]: is used and how it's formulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would show them the efficacy
because they don't approve it unless it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have approved other essential
oils like garlic oil, rosemary oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those types of things are already approved
as bio pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the same turpings are in those
as well.
So that's kind of where we are at right
now.
