[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned nano emulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those listeners and hosts who might
not be familiar with what exactly that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: could you sort of explain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's go back to the very basics on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very basics are what is an emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can think about an emulsion as
very, very simple as making salad
[SPEAKER_01]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take your oil and your vinegar and you
shake it and you get something that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: very different than oil and vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's going to be a very,
very weak emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to separate out in some cases
before you can even get it out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle onto your salad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we do with a nano emulsion is we
make those little oil droplets very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nano means like 10 to the ninth when
you're talking about things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we make these very small and we
sustain the terpenes in these compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: in these little oil bubbles essentially,
and they will stay in solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been able to keep them on the lab
bench at room temperature for over two
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's in water?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in water and we use a natural soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called tween.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically we are going for things that
are extremely safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we only use products in what we're
doing that are considered to be grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grass is G-R-A-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an FDA category that's generally
regarded as safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bottom line is this is a pesticide
that you could probably eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wouldn't advise it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are trying to make it as safe as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm glad you brought that up because
obviously, yeah, terpenes, they smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're adding these to the
plant, is it going to affect, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's cannabis, it's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're looking to put this on other
crops, is it going to affect the smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: taste of those crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we would have, I think we
would have a limit of how late we can
[SPEAKER_01]: spray this on some crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you wouldn't want to dunk
your apple in it and keep that as a
[SPEAKER_01]: post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you spray like the Kupert kurbits,
we didn't affect the quality of those by
[SPEAKER_01]: doing earlier sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did not spray the fruit themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in most cases, we're not looking for
the plant as the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at a fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have to be careful when you
can spray those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also remember that terpenes are
ephemeral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even ours will eventually go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a feeling that we won't be
using them on post-harvest because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it will affect consumer taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it will affect the quality of the
product.
Thank you for watching.
