[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: For a while, you're going to be stuck with
me for a full hour, just about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I cannot thank my panel enough for
being organized, stepping up, and being
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a short, short
introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to look at the AV guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have the, oh, where we go?
[SPEAKER_02]: So all I have to do is click?
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good way to start this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal for today, actually, is going to
be discussing broadly these specific
[SPEAKER_02]: topics about cannabis tissue culture in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to give kind of a brief
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about some of the
challenges, opportunities, and what we see
[SPEAKER_02]: the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I go into any of the other
slides, I wanted to turn it over to the
[SPEAKER_02]: panelists to introduce themselves in hopes
that you guys can get an idea of who's
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking with you today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And start thinking about some questions
and how you might want to direct them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll take us through a couple
other slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to sit down with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll just kind of take it topic by
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Justin, you want to start us off?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name's Justin Gibbons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the CEO and founder of Apical Biotech.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a 25-year California cannabis native.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been through all of it, the good,
bad, and the ugly.
[SPEAKER_05]: At Apical Biotech, we're essentially
trying to bridge the gap between legacy
[SPEAKER_05]: farmers and growers and the scientific
groups that are coming into cannabis now
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's more legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Matthew Schneider.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my master's in agronomy from the
University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I currently am a tissue culture R&D
scientist at Apical Biotech with Justin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have spent well over 20,000 hours inside
of the hood, done many thousands of
[SPEAKER_03]: Maristem tip isolations, and have
provenably cleaned hoplite and viroid from
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Carl Rave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a PhD plant molecular biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my PhD from the French National
Institute of Agronomy and then came to the
[SPEAKER_00]: US at Colorado State University,
where I worked in plant nutrition on some
[SPEAKER_00]: biotechnology aspects since 13 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently, I joined Tesoro
Genetics, which is a company we are
[SPEAKER_00]: characterizing existing genotypes and
breeding for elite varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm Dr. Hope Jones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in the cannabis industry for
just under 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have had the pleasure and the
opportunity to bring my background in
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled environment ag, also as a
molecular and cellular biologist,
[SPEAKER_02]: to this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a grower at heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that I do in my industry is
about growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also, even when I'm doing a lot of
my legislative work, I have the mindset of
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation and growers in mind and heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in my opinion, everything
downstream or upstream, however you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to think of it, is dependent on our
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything we do in this industry is about
this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the retail is what drives the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in order to have the best business
possible, we've got to have the best
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, health, and cultivation
practices possible, especially as our
[SPEAKER_02]: margins start to get more competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then this is kind of like a day in the
week for most of us here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The focus on why we're here, it's exciting
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We obviously have this huge market,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are talking a lot about clinical
studies, the medical potential to help
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands or millions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have research, like low-hanging fruit
we've never had before, because we have
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant, this one plant in the entire
planet that seems to have so many effects
[SPEAKER_02]: on not just human populations,
but mammals in general, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have hundreds of cannabinoids,
yet we still have to better understand
[SPEAKER_02]: their roles and characterize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have to understand we're
dealing with a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a brand new industry legally,
and we are here on the shoulders of
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody who had this clandestine
industry before us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're coming together and learning
to be commercial producers, retail
[SPEAKER_02]: markets, brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's kind of a nice problem to
have, but we have a lot of them that we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have the academic
understanding, decades and decades,
[SPEAKER_02]: if not 50 to 100 years of research like we
do for orchids and a lot of these other
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, these are new crop problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, our genetics, and I'm going
to just go through these.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I'm hoping we can kind of
have a conversation about.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not just the four bullet points
that I had on the slide, but this is
[SPEAKER_02]: really what we get into when we think
about what we have to deal with from the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything about those genetics,
we need to understand epigenetics and what
[SPEAKER_02]: that means and how that affects our
decline.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to also understand the best and
practice the best cultivation practices
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can, and we're not quite there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have pest and disease
pressures like we've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a theory as to why that is,
and we're going to talk in some great tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're in the black market and
you're growing underground and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing on a much smaller scale and you
are isolated, you're isolated from other
[SPEAKER_02]: populations, your other people,
very few people walk in your grows,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you on a daily basis the number
of tours that owners do through their
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation facilities is very different
than back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as this is a nascent industry,
the idea of putting on PPE or the
[SPEAKER_02]: protective equipment before giving the
shows and the tours, making sure that we
[SPEAKER_02]: understand how to properly deal with our
tools, et cetera, all of those things
[SPEAKER_02]: matter and lead to our problems that we
have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the link on what that has to do with
the medical, the research, the yields,
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom line, all of our problems with
this plant and as growers affects
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're here to talk about what some of
those solutions are going to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's where we're going to talk about
some of the tissue culture pros.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about when it comes to
a tissue culture laboratory, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: yours, you're interested in it,
or whether you're looking to do business
[SPEAKER_02]: with a company because that's going to be
one of the more common practices happening
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: What should we all be thinking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of questions might we think
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're the consumer if you're
talking to a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of questions might you be
wanting to know, ask, and then how is a
[SPEAKER_02]: real facility being operated and run?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you have this technology,
these skills, what else can we do with
[SPEAKER_02]: those tools?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's going to be some
discussion on a call to action afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to come back to this slide in
just a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, the whole idea is we all want
to get to quality, high-consistence,
[SPEAKER_02]: reliable product, and we want the best
research and development that we can for
[SPEAKER_02]: our clinical and medical outputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we deal with though,
right now where we're at, is this playing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you guys maybe hit that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how we just read each other like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is Justin's, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a perfect lead-in to the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a couple of days later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot of misconceptions in the
industry, and I'm going to let him follow
[SPEAKER_02]: through on the stories that are going to
be there and talk about yourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to kind of just take it maybe
one by one, and then we're going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: back a few slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the meantime, why Justin tells us
the history, I'm going to leave that there
[SPEAKER_02]: for right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you tell us what was going on
with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of misconceptions going
around about what can and can't happen
[SPEAKER_05]: with virus and viroid eradication or
remediation in cannabis tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Early on, I would say there was a lot of
bad testing first.
[SPEAKER_05]: So knowing what hoplite and viroid was and
being able to reliably test for it without
[SPEAKER_05]: having false positives or false negatives
was probably about 2017, 2018.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people didn't know about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now the community is really much more
educated on it, and there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_05]: testing labs, testing for it, and
availability.
[SPEAKER_05]: To access those, unlike before.
[SPEAKER_05]: But remediating it, cannabis suffers from
maybe some anecdotal or observational
[SPEAKER_05]: hunches and maybe some folklore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So simply put it, maristomatic excision
does it reliably.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just about technique and numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a lot of people that have all
kinds of different ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: That idea stemmed from we heard a client
say they can clean it in two days,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they were using gamma radiation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, okay, well, I'll believe
it when I see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the mutations, it would probably
happen, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You just look at white papers of several
other crops that they've done that in,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they actually wanted the mutations to
see what else they could produce.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where that video stemmed from.
[SPEAKER_05]: But cannabis just suffers a lot of that
misinformation, and we're really trying
[SPEAKER_05]: hard to combat that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was a nice, humorous way to
be able to illustrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one thing to try something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another thing to maybe believe it
because it's online.
[SPEAKER_02]: More about the maristomatic versus nodal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering, Matt, if you wanted to,
you do this on a day-to-day.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the advantages of having you on
this panel is, so Matt comes to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been doing tissue culture for a long
time, but coming into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, I'd also like to hear about your
learn curve in that regard as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I said earlier, I got my master's
at University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there I worked on the genetic
transformation of sugarcane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the methods of which I learned there
are not exactly applicable to cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: propagation, micropropagation that I've
learned here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of academic standards that
are taught that many people just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: take on face value and think can be
applied to every single crop out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: General purpose topics like a subject
technique of operating inside of a laminar
[SPEAKER_03]: flow hood, not contaminating your
cultures, definitely applicable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my time in academia definitely helped
learn that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also had to untrain myself with a
lot of practices that I learned in
[SPEAKER_03]: academia, namely just the way that
different crops grow in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way you have to plant them inside of
the media, the different types of
[SPEAKER_03]: excisions you have to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with my time at Apical, I've spent a
lot of time doing meristem tip excision,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the primary method through which
we remediate hoplite and viroid and
[SPEAKER_03]: systemic bacterial infections.
[SPEAKER_03]: This requires you to get underneath a
dissection scope and peel back the layers
[SPEAKER_03]: of the meristem tip in order to isolate a
non-bacterial non-vascular portion of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's critical to get a non-vascular
portion because the vasculature,
[SPEAKER_03]: the xylem and the phloem are where viruses
and the viroids and systemic bacteria
[SPEAKER_03]: live.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you make a cut through this
vasculature, for example, nodal
[SPEAKER_03]: propagation, traditional cloning,
or an improperly excised meristem,
[SPEAKER_03]: you are just further propagating the
systemic pathogens inside the plant onto
[SPEAKER_03]: your clean plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you have to grow up your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to test it repeatedly through
quantitative PCR.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only do you have to test it once,
you have to test it multiple times over a
[SPEAKER_03]: long duration of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Previous presenters talked about low viral
loads inside of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this can absolutely be true in the
tissue culture plants as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a really low titer level
inside of your tissue culture plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: you test and you sample that plant
improperly, you might find that it is a
[SPEAKER_03]: false negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you test that plant three,
six, nine months later after it's grown,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll find that the hoplite and viroid
has come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was never actually removed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a problem that I think is
relatively common in the industry where
[SPEAKER_03]: people are claiming to remediate hoplite
and viroid but still putting out dirty
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's interesting that
because this is a new, everything about
[SPEAKER_02]: doing any biotechnology with cannabis is
fairly new.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any evidence that we have or lack of
evidence, it seems like we have to infer
[SPEAKER_02]: based off of what's happening with other
closely related crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do wonder if given the fact that we
don't have most of the groups,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I know all of us up here,
we're not academics in the sense that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're at a university and we're PIs
running our own grants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my God, I was just literally drooling
looking at Poonjah's pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I enjoyed doing the collaborations
with the universities, but we don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: those technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at how many times do we
need to test this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking to the third-party labs,
trying to understand how they validate
[SPEAKER_02]: their testing methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the companies that I use, and you guys
tell me about the labs for testing for
[SPEAKER_02]: these diseases, first of all, they're not
going to be necessarily the same labs as
[SPEAKER_02]: your compliance labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to get them to talk to us about
how they validate, I don't need to know
[SPEAKER_02]: primer sequences, but you should be able
to have a conversation with me when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: been validated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see our industry in the same
situation that the analytical labs were in
[SPEAKER_02]: the earlier days in trying to get our
methods validated, or at least understood,
[SPEAKER_02]: or all on the same page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys find that you have that same
challenge running your facilities or in
[SPEAKER_02]: the past when you have?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, sampling, number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cross-contamination is a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the money grab happening in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The inability to work with universities
because of federal funding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're completely afraid of touching
cannabis, especially THC cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them work with hemp, but not many
of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still find it too risky.
[SPEAKER_05]: So having access to those things,
it's a big time problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's why we have a lot of
the problems we do now is because we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have proper access.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have access.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carl, I'm curious with your background
and what you're going to be doing from the
[SPEAKER_02]: biotech side, how do you go about thinking
about, OK, so we have the ability to do
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we wanted to bring in testing or if
we're using groups like you, what is it
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what should we know going into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: As Matthew previously said, I think we
have to adapt all the protocols to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, we can obviously use
protocol establishment over crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species of plant species in order to start
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by experience, what we have seen is
when you work with cannabis, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different than other plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually very difficult for
several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, because the protocols are not
adapted to that plant and because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lack of characterization of the
genotypes we are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known that some plant genotypes are
very recalcitrant to tissue culturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other crop species, we have been able
to find some ways to alleviate this issue
[SPEAKER_00]: or to just not work with these kind of
genotypes in progress trades by breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we would like to do in cannabis,
especially using new biotechnologies like
[SPEAKER_00]: genome editing, is ready to work on a
germplasm and improve that one without
[SPEAKER_00]: having to spend time for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we are not yet there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The technique is new on tissue culturing
in cannabis, especially making callus and
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerating real plants from
undifferentiated cells is quite tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Requires a lot of progress, try on errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we are all working a little bit
isolated because it's not a big domain
[SPEAKER_00]: like in academia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we will benefit a lot by sharing
more protocols, more data in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: progress the community as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to go about, so we were
talking earlier and then one of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that as a lab, a tissue culture company,
we have to be very aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just like cloning conventional
what we do when we're doing our
[SPEAKER_02]: multiplication.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be exactly identical to the
donor plant that we took the cuts from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are considerations that we need
to take when it comes to mutations if we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't do our practices correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those factors that we need to
consider are mutations, DNA variants.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to sequencing, how would you
go about doing that yourself for your own
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics or if you were to do this
consulting, let's say, for a group and
[SPEAKER_02]: said you want to know if they're DNA off
typing, what would you advise that they
[SPEAKER_02]: learn to ask?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you rephrase the question?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I get the feedback as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard for me to understand you
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you go about doing DNA variants
testing and what's the significance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that important?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should we know about that as an
industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of questions could you advise
them to ask of labs like us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Related to tissue culturing specifically?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue culturing and just DNA off types,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the tissue culturing is the
capacity for a genotype to perform well
[SPEAKER_00]: during tissue culturing is based on genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either we have genes that allow cells to
grow fast or we have genes that allow
[SPEAKER_00]: regeneration of a different kind of tissue
from indifferentiated cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to characterize the genotypes in
order to know which one could be prone to
[SPEAKER_00]: the treatment we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a massive characterization of a
lot of cultivars, it's very difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: right now to tell you what we are looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we have to identify cultivars
that are very, very efficient at this in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to then make some correlation with
the genome and to identify potential
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins that are really helping any part
of the process of tissue culturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can obviously get some of this
knowledge from other crops or other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the lack of characterization of
cannabis genomes is very likely a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottleneck right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we have seen in previous talks
that things are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is much more science on the cannabis
and more genomic data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this will change over the next
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, I mean, either you have a
genotype that is very prone and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: happy and you can do things or you have a
genotype that is very recalcitrant and you
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was working on Compass in Colorado,
basically, my funding source was to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: some local germplasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I picked five varieties from
Colorado and none of them was successful,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's working with other
germplasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have to understand what's the
difference between these and to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed, potentially to breed your germplasm
of interest with that one that will
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger a good tissue culturing in your
cultivar of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, yes, we just need to do more
research and identify what makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar amenable to this kind of tissue
culturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different aspects of tissue culturing
require different genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we will be able to find a
genotype that is good for transformation,
[SPEAKER_00]: regeneration, for quick propagation of a
genotype that roots very easily is also
[SPEAKER_00]: something very important for
micropropagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be the same germplasm than
the one that will regenerate a shoot from
[SPEAKER_00]: a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to characterize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a community, we have to find this
and hopefully share data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can progress as a community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's three more slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd like to open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I do those last three slides,
I wanted to ask the two of you guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to the genotype,
the day-to-day running a lab, your
[SPEAKER_02]: experience and anything you want to share
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to training people and
the type of individuals who are best in
[SPEAKER_02]: the hood, I thought maybe the two of you
could tag team that little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation.
Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the number one trait I would look
for in a lab technician is their attention
[SPEAKER_03]: to detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always train them to get faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always teach them how to do
specific movements.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they're not going to pay attention
to the little tiny details, the proper
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of nodes on your microcutting,
making sure your blade doesn't touch the
[SPEAKER_03]: vasculature of your meristem excision,
making sure you're putting in 100
[SPEAKER_03]: microliters of hormone and not 95,
these little tiny things all add up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you have 20, 30 techs running,
those mistakes can compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have good practices in place
to make sure that you're not getting your
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars mixed up, that labeling is being
done properly, and inventory is probably
[SPEAKER_03]: being managed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I would say most people can be
trained to be a good technician.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, can they be a great technician?
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to have that attention to
detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think trimmers would make good
technicians?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they would because they have to do
the detail for hours at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been so far removed from the general
cultivation of cannabis that I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think trimmers might make great
technicians, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: They take too many breaks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they might have to train,
retrain some habits for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've actually tried that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's it like running a lab?
[SPEAKER_05]: Small lab or big lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've been in all kinds of labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I built small labs, extremely small labs
for germplasm storage and just cleaning to
[SPEAKER_05]: put into a high throughput, just
traditional nursery production system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've designed and built out larger
labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say the larger labs a little more
difficult because trying to create Gantt
[SPEAKER_05]: charts and production system that works in
unison with the cultivators that are
[SPEAKER_05]: typically less organized becomes
difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, a lot of the times, market demand
affects the larger labs because the
[SPEAKER_05]: market's always demanding such quick
change of what the users want.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you keep up on it with TC and being
able to pivot in that way?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a larger lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the challenges.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keeping up with it, you have to be
extremely organized, and you have to plan
[SPEAKER_05]: the cultivars that you want to cultivate
or what you're going to put into the
[SPEAKER_05]: nursery months and months ahead of time to
scale the micropropagation aspect of it to
[SPEAKER_05]: meet those production deadlines.
[SPEAKER_05]: The smaller labs, I find, are a little bit
easier to manage when put into a larger
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional nursery structure because
those immediate changes or pivots are a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit easier to manage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Less mistakes happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say that one of the biggest common
problems in traditional nurseries and in
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis in general is you have low-level
labor that is working on the cuttings and
[SPEAKER_05]: labeling and plugging.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the times, they mislabel.
[SPEAKER_05]: That happens in the lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can imagine if you mislabel in a lab
and you're on an eight-month production
[SPEAKER_05]: deadline and you've just scaled thousands
of plants that are all the wrong cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having that track and trace is key and
having, like you said, that attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other aspects of a facility if
this is something that you're thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about doing for yourself in-house or if
you were to be doing any kind of due
[SPEAKER_02]: diligence on a tissue culture company.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal for the type of facility when
Justin's mentioning small or big,
[SPEAKER_02]: it depends on what the intention is and
the purpose and the goal of the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I work with groups on their design,
do they want to become a nursery and
[SPEAKER_02]: provide young plants into the wholesale or
the retail markets?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they want to do research or maybe they
want to just do their in-house production
[SPEAKER_02]: for elite mother stock?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those factors versus being a large
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're a large commercial facility
and I've done many of those designs,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the things and one of the factors
out of all the minis that I have designed,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can maybe count on one hand how many of
them actually got built.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the biggest mistakes that I've seen
when it comes to thinking about doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: in one's own company is this idea that you
can do a lot in a very small amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: space in a very short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say all of that in theory is
true, but not with the ideas and the
[SPEAKER_02]: misconceptions that's in the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that you need is you do
need to maintain and everybody knows about
[SPEAKER_02]: having the cleaner rooms or a clean room
for doing the actual transfers in a
[SPEAKER_02]: laminar flow hood.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do need that consideration,
but does that need to be together with
[SPEAKER_02]: everything or do you need multiple spaces?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every square footage matters to every
owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue culture, while you produce a large
number in a very small footprint,
[SPEAKER_02]: the ramp up to get to that large-scale
production, if anybody's thinking it's
[SPEAKER_02]: less than six months or a year,
you're out of your minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take anything home from that,
it is an investment not only on the
[SPEAKER_02]: resources and the financial resources,
it is an investment on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every strain that we work with,
because we are dealing with such a,
[SPEAKER_02]: our own epidemic of diseases and age and
epigenetic decline, it's essentially we
[SPEAKER_02]: have to do a cleanup for every single
genetic that we are working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when it comes from seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you guys agree even when it comes
from seeds, you've seen the seed-borne
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases, we're starting to see actual
evidence and data that the hoplite and
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid is transmissible by the seed and
that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: This embryo came from a infected mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important for us to actually
understand some of those nuances and time
[SPEAKER_02]: and factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I'm gonna just jump to so
we have time, a good amount of time for,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh wait, yeah, interaction with you guys
and your questions is the type of supplies
[SPEAKER_02]: that we use in consumables.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the individuals who is gonna be on
the panel is actually a vendor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see enough people talking about
what goes into the labs, what type of
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment supplies consumables.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk a lot about some of the OPEX,
but we don't really spend very much time
[SPEAKER_02]: in the consideration and the factors when
it comes to things even like our culture
[SPEAKER_02]: vessels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our vessels is like a mini room,
an actual room with four walls,
[SPEAKER_02]: a ceiling, and a floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we use for our vessels matters as
much as the four walls, the ceiling,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the wall of any one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what this company does.
[SPEAKER_02]: They provide this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have micro bags when it comes
for mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to their filters,
and we can kind of maybe leave this on
[SPEAKER_02]: here, has anybody used any of their
products before or what's your
[SPEAKER_02]: consideration when it comes to vessels,
gas rate?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know ethylene is terrible for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what kind of supplies and
equipment when you're doing biotechnology?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of biotech laboratory would you
consider?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, right off the bat, I am from a
business standpoint, and a lot of these
[SPEAKER_05]: facilities that we go to, at the end of
the day, it's about cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to compare vessel to labor
cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's several other vessels out
there, but this one is extremely efficient
[SPEAKER_05]: labor-wise, and it breathes really well
and keeps out contamination.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen things attack tissue culture
labs, like thrips.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen thrips get inside test tubes
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: People didn't parafilm them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you put parafilm on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They breathe less.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get hyperhidric plants, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So these vessels are really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like these vessels.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very efficient, but they're also
costly as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're far away, and they take
forever to get here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have a global closure,
and it makes it even harder to get them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So always have a backup in house as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But look at ultimate goal of the lab and
kind of decipher there what makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a really small lab and you're
only preserving your own germplasm,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can get away with magenta boxes and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But depending on the design of the lab and
cleanliness of it, you can have higher
[SPEAKER_05]: contamination issues as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some people out there that just
buy cheap deli containers and use
[SPEAKER_05]: micropore tape on the top of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen that work, but also much
higher contamination rates with that as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the labor that goes into actually
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still, I mean, gosh, I did that
back in college in the early 90s with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Band-Aid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just use a hole punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stick one of those small round
Band-Aids, and you have filtration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about it, the bottom of
the Band-Aid, when you open it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's sterile, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's labor that goes into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love micro boxes a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have saved so many cultivars of mine
through, I don't know, various
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental problems, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: The breathability of the filters on the
micro box is critical to your success in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was one of the biggest things
that I had to unlearn.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the vessels that I worked with
previously, no matter if it was sugar cane
[SPEAKER_03]: or energy cane or potato or hops,
none of them had vents.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all just sealed, like GA7
vessels or tube containers or test tubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis loves ventilation, and the micro
boxes work really, really well for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes through its nutrients in the
containers very fast once it has roots,
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they root, they just take off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can get these micro boxes gamma
sterilized from the factory.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just open up the sleeve.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Petri dishes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to autoclave them or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are re-autoclavable, should you
want to reuse them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be green.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only factor I think about with them,
though, unfortunately, is the more
[SPEAKER_05]: concerned environmental side of me is all
the plastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we could find a solution to that
long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working more at the cellular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so to use more Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would guess that the need of gas
exchange is not as dramatic as with a real
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which is transpiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even at the cellular level,
you need a gas exchange for maintaining,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are growing in Petri dishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we usually put a kind of classic
breathable tape just to allow gas
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have seen in bigger plants that at
the beginning, I was growing in vitro
[SPEAKER_00]: small seedlings in a sealed cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using beer cups, actually,
sterile beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice, but it was not breathing at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could see that my plants-
Hyperhydric?
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't like it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think the micro box is a
solution, the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to see if there's any
questions out there before we go on asking
[SPEAKER_02]: some questions of each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would be better if we didn't do
that, if there are questions out there by
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody got some questions,
please line up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll just take our questions in
turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned preservation of premium
mother stock.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it made me think about scale and where
tissue culture is overall in scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you see, for our industry,
tissue culture really being a replacement
[SPEAKER_07]: for cloning now or eventually?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it more a strategy, as you talked
about, to clean up and preserve,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it be DNA strains or premium
mother stock?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give my answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then pass it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't, in the immediate,
and I'm very transparent and honest with
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody I speak to about this,
I don't, in the immediate, see tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture replacing cloning, conventional
cloning, until we have automation,
[SPEAKER_02]: until there's more companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm opening up in Arizona a new lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one group could max me out from what I
could do on a throughput capacity in one
[SPEAKER_02]: day, with one order.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would never advise a company to
go down that route when a company like
[SPEAKER_02]: mine will never close.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's say it closed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you lost all your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think eventually we will get
there, however, because it will be more
[SPEAKER_02]: automated, cheaper, faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody won't be so worried about,
in the same way, and attached to their
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: With more research time, money,
and proof of concept on the ground in the
[SPEAKER_02]: fields by many, many growers, people will
eventually trust the genetics that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: buying from the nurseries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will eventually say, it makes a
lot of sense for me to convert my square
[SPEAKER_02]: footage, instead of paying the overhead,
nothing that contributes to the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there grows to propagation and to
mother's space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see us still years away from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, the market currently is
still pretty unstable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the lack of federal legalization is
going to inhibit the growth of it
[SPEAKER_05]: initially.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do see long term, though, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: The market's going to kind of copy the
craft beer market, where you're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: have Budweiser dominating likely 85% of
the market and the consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll have a niche 15% approximately
doing the more craft aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not going to happen for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe five to 10 years from now,
when cannabis is federally legalized,
[SPEAKER_05]: I do see scale TC labs working
phenomenally.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's because they're going to be
able to scale specific cultivars that are
[SPEAKER_05]: in high demand and contracted with
extremely large scale growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it does have a big future,
but only with particular groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also going to take a lot of money
to get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're going to have to invest a
lot of money and time into building a
[SPEAKER_05]: large enough lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then scaling those cultivars to be
able to meet that kind of scale and
[SPEAKER_05]: demand.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, on a small scale, it's already
here to stay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And almost every cultivation facility,
now that I see being designed or I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: helping design myself, we're putting a
small lab in just to hold germplasm and do
[SPEAKER_05]: cleaning.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's definitely going to help the craft
aspect as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, scaling that, they typically change
cultivars so often that I recommend
[SPEAKER_05]: sticking with a traditional nursery and
being able to do it that way because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: more efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the craft level, it's definitely
very cutthroat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you need to be on the cutting edge of
what's new as far as cultivars and
[SPEAKER_05]: creating that demand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So scaling, micro propagation in those
situations is not ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could take another question unless the
two of you have anything to offer there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if there's a best practice
emerging.
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize there's more than one way to
skin a cat.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, like for growers or doing
in-house or service providers doing this,
[SPEAKER_06]: is there a typical way, for example,
you could just take cuttings and do
[SPEAKER_06]: basically micro propagation where you're
just putting in a tube and then rooting
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can then do further steps where you
multiply that into five or 10 more and
[SPEAKER_06]: then put them in their own tubes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a typical process now?
[SPEAKER_06]: The growers are sort of establishing for
that kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're talking in tissue culture or
from the conventional cloning aspect?
[SPEAKER_06]: For tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're ramping up for production,
there's one mode that we do for
[SPEAKER_02]: multiplication and ramping up when we're
just in the cleanup and for ramping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we're talking production,
you need to keep a certain percentage
[SPEAKER_02]: in-house to meet reoccurring orders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say you have a vessel that has 12
explants in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we are in that mode, we might send
75% off for rooting and keep that 25%
[SPEAKER_02]: in-house for our continued ramp up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that material will be available and
maintained for us for orders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I understand your question correctly?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially, one cutting ends up in one
tube and gets rooted.
[SPEAKER_06]: It isn't then further.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we need one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need one clean one that we have
demonstrated is not testing positive for
[SPEAKER_02]: any of the diseases that we test for in
our panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that single explant then can generate
thousands and tens of thousands of plants
[SPEAKER_02]: thereafter.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so they do chop it up into a bunch of
small ones basically.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's typical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's definitely in the pro column.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over here this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first question is, are you utilizing
any sort of endophytes to harden plants
[SPEAKER_01]: off or re-inoculating plants to be able to
sustain any kind of stress factors or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: But second question is, is there any kind
of protocol for turning over mothers once
[SPEAKER_01]: you are taking cuttings off of a
tissue-cultured mother that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing that's clean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot hear anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the first question I couldn't quite
understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second question, as far as turnover
goes with your mother plants and
[SPEAKER_05]: tissue-cultured plants, it's more of a
contamination question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I often see nurseries become
contaminated even if they start clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes three to six months for that to
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of growers talk about genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they inappropriately use that term
to just talk about decline of the mother
[SPEAKER_05]: plants because they're having nutrient
issues or have become contaminated with
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see pseudomonas often systemically
contaminating the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I take an approach where you just have
a consistent schedule of replacing the
[SPEAKER_05]: moms from culture so that even if it does
happen, you're not really seeing those
[SPEAKER_05]: issues down the line because you're kind
of making sure it doesn't constantly
[SPEAKER_05]: happen and then exaggerate through the
rest of the cultivation cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I recommend about every three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I understood the first part of
your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I'm working with my clients on
the hardening and acclimation on their
[SPEAKER_02]: ends, they're not getting a rooted cutting
or a rooted plant from me traditionally in
[SPEAKER_02]: a plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sending them what we call stage
threes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are rooted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a different shipping media without
sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I teach, you know, there's SOP and
protocols that goes with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you want to think about the hardening
and acclimation process that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very easy for these, especially in
the propagation team, to get this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though they have roots, they don't
have the waxy cuticle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not very photosynthetically
active because they've been in a high 100%
[SPEAKER_02]: relative humidity since it was a little
baby ex-plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that process is still a two to three
week process just like rooting is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you go through your hardening and
acclimation steps in the same way as you
[SPEAKER_02]: do a rooted clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only these plants come with roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really about that new first set
of leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next set are the ones that are going
to have the more active stomata to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase that stomata and that
photosynthetic activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those new sets, because those
ones that actually go in under the domes,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are not the ones that are hardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that new growth that comes out that's
hardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it takes two weeks regardless.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that's what your question was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously the scale up of tissue cloning
has to do with automation, as you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Automation also will come with a bunch of
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that data, of course, can be mined for
insights.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering where you think those
insights could feed back into the growing
[SPEAKER_04]: process.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking specifically around
epigenetic decline, which by its name we
[SPEAKER_04]: know it has to do with how a plant is
grown and whether there could be at some
[SPEAKER_04]: point essentially a correlation between
what you're seeing with epigenetic decline
[SPEAKER_04]: and methods of growing so that you could
essentially be feeding back into a
[SPEAKER_04]: grower's knowledge of how they may be
epigenetically declining their assets over
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a big question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to take it in parts if you
don't mind a little bit, because I think
[SPEAKER_02]: first of all, it requires a lot of
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the data that's necessary,
basically we need as an industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: not as a group in the niche of tissue
culture, but as an industry, every
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar or chemo type should be sold like
with those little sticks that you get at a
[SPEAKER_02]: nursery that tells you approximately the
type of light that it needs, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, until we have the biotechnology
behind us that has all of the markers,
[SPEAKER_02]: until we have things identified,
most tissue culture companies don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: also grows to be able to flower out.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if in those other groups that do,
oftentimes it's with collaborators and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's oftentimes also when I get called
out to consult and I get called out to
[SPEAKER_02]: consult in those situations because these
two worlds are not merging well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a problem between taking a
clean plant from the lab and then taking
[SPEAKER_02]: the same ass approach that we take to
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a living organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will never be free of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will go through epigenetic decline.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need the data to understand the
timeline and the stressors that seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: lead to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to take years of research
by academic institutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you also have these large
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I might be getting off on a tangent,
but I hope I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just bear with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you also have the larger companies
that are putting in more money into R&D,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's proprietary information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's got to be a way for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to turn it over to you
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be a way for us to generate
the data that you want and that you speak
[SPEAKER_02]: to that is necessary because let's get
down to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just growing plants here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just tell me the best way to grow the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me how often I need to replace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I should be able to have high
quality, predictable yields and follow
[SPEAKER_02]: that business model.
[SPEAKER_02]: But until we have the research and
development, how could we actually get
[SPEAKER_02]: there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there a way to get there faster?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Allison Justin is going to talk about
it in the next talk, but I also want to
[SPEAKER_02]: turn it over to Matt and Justin here
because they are also trying to target
[SPEAKER_02]: this because we need a lot more data.
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt, you want to talk about the DAO?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know how many people here are
familiar with the DAO.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stands for Decentralized Autonomous
Organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically a group of people
grouping together on crypto rails.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have this vision of creating a DAO
where people will come together to
[SPEAKER_03]: contribute funds to fund open source
cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've discussed multiple times here,
the traditional academic industry doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily mesh well with cannabis due to
federal regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a lot harder to get federal grants
from big companies or the government,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we can all come together as a group
to fund the science that we think is
[SPEAKER_03]: important, I think we can make a lot of
good headway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that said, is there a part of the
question that we didn't get to?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the software that's out there,
do you have any recommendations in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of a software that's close in terms of
managing TC and also being able to pull
[SPEAKER_04]: data out for enriched insights?
[SPEAKER_02]: In VitroSoft is one that comes to mind,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not very many out there
because it's very different to track.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys know of some, go ahead and
throw it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got about five more minutes,
and then we need to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But In VitroSoft would be one to come to
mind before we go on to the next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any others?
[SPEAKER_05]: In VitroSoft is pretty standard.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought there was another question over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, we got another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only got five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's not any more questions,
then I think we might turn it over to the
[SPEAKER_02]: next panel to get ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any final thoughts,
you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: For a panel that just got thrown together,
so thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
