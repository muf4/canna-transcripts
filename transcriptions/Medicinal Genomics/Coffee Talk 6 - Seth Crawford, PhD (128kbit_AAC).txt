[SPEAKER_02]: CanMed 2020 VIP dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this episode, we talk with our CanMed
2020 cultivation keynote presenter,
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth Crawford of Oregon CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth and the team at Oregon CBD specialize
in turning out new, exciting, and unique
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial hemp varieties designed for
maximum yield and large scale production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their early adoption of disruptive testing
technology and large scale breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques allowed Oregon CBD to produce a
number of industry firsts, including the
[SPEAKER_02]: first high cannabinoid content auto
flowering CBD plant and the first pure
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG, CBC, CBDV, CBGV, and CBCV field ready
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: His presentation at CanMed 2018 was an
instant hit, and as I mentioned in our
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation, Seth was mobbed with
questions from attendees immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: following it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know because I was trying to get an
interview with him and had to wait for the
[SPEAKER_02]: crowd to clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: We dig into some of the details of that
CanMed 2018 presentation, particularly the
[SPEAKER_02]: process his team uses to develop unique,
stable hemp seed varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth shares his thoughts on where the hemp
industry is headed, as well as some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges the industry is facing this
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also noticed when I listened back to the
recording that Seth dropped several
[SPEAKER_02]: references to the year 2021, which could
offer some hints into what the keynote
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation he has planned for CanMed
2020, which happens to be titled Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: 2021, The Golden Age of Discovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are excited to have Seth as a keynote
at CanMed 2020 this year, and we are
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to see you there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to canmedevents.com now to see our
ticket pricing options and get your ticket
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are currently offering early bird
pricing through August 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also offering a 100% refund to

[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without any further ado, please enjoy my
conversation with Seth Crawford of Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Seth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me say, the team's really excited
to have you as our keynote presenter for
[SPEAKER_02]: the cultivation focus area for CanMed
2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your presentation at CanMed 2018 was a
standout for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I might have a question or two about
that as I'm a novice when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: plant breeding, but I'm still very
interested in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if others are interested, and I
imagine you are if you're listening,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I encourage you to listen to Seth's
CanMed 2018 presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put a link in our show description so
you can check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I remember correctly, and you could
tell me, but I think you were mobbed after
[SPEAKER_02]: the talk with people asking questions and
maybe handing you business cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we knew we had to have you back as a
keynote and that we were sure that you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: have new data to present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering, we're dying to know what
is it you're looking to present at CanMed
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020 this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most definitely mobbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fantastic to get that kind of
response from folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in a lot of ways what we're doing
up here in Oregon, and there's other folks
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world that are engaged in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In similar levels as us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're doing is really
dramatically different from previous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the things that we've been lucky
enough to uncover both on a phenotype and
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype and now even genotype level is
just distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different from what's available and
we're continuing to push that forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year we're really excited to be
able to talk about some of the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: projects that we're working on,
obviously, both the collection of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype data, chemotype data,
genotype data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give you a little bit of an
update on our collaboration with Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: State University and how that's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of very interesting
fronts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at some larger
population genomic studies that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: engaged in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when Kevin was on talking about
his presentation, the Eurofin snip chip,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're participating in that with some of
our F2 varieties along with some competing
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches that are really looking at
identifying structural variants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: present in the cannabis genome and
specifically structural variants between
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals within the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be where a lot of the most
interesting examples pop up in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: new genotypes that express new chemotypes
and new phenotypes that are much,
[SPEAKER_00]: much more acclimated for specific types of
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really excited to be able to
share the findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we're still in the process of
gathering all that information,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we think that it's going to be a
significant revolutionary shift in the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis is produced based on a lot
of the results that us and others are
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating on finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, are you still very much at this stage
looking for, you said, variations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it in regards to cannabinoid
expression, terpenes, and potency sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: things, or are you looking also at actual
plant structure or drought resistance and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the above, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, any good breeding program,
you really have to narrow in on things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are really, really critical for
specific projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that the answer to that
depends on the project that we're working
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have some awesome trials going
on with OSU over the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 12 different states as of this
afternoon that are engaged in a
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-state land-grant university variety
trial to be able to assess what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: differences emerge in different
ecosystems, whether it's from flower
[SPEAKER_00]: timing to disease resistance to water
usage, a number of other trials going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the Western United States
specifically focusing on water
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff's all really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think some of the biggest
breakthroughs that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at for 2021 are really coming down
to chemical data and chemical changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you're probably well aware,
the USDA has made it fairly difficult for
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp farmers to continue to
grow large fields of cannabinoid-rich
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, specifically CBD plants,
in part due to the underlying genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: predisposition of the CBDase synthase to
produce some residual THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have actually figured out a way to
basically get around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got some wonderful, wonderful
plants that are very, very rich in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, CBDase, CBDVA, CBCA,
and have great olfactory characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are plants that have wonderful
terpenes and other compounds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for making the plant smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is going to be something that
everybody comes to understand a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we're really excited about these
new chemotypes and being able to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: into farmers' hands to allow them to
continue successfully producing low-cost
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids for the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Oregon CBD is specifically focused on
hemp, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw in your list of questions that this
was going to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My PhD is in sociology, so I'm going to
just step back and say any dichotomy,
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of external definition that we
place on the cannabis plant is a social
[SPEAKER_00]: construct, first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more similarities between a plant
that has, say, a THCase synthase that's
[SPEAKER_00]: active and a plant that has a CBDase
synthase that's active outside of those
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, those two synthases end up
determining what's legal in most countries
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it doesn't necessarily demarcate
an actual difference between plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got into the industrial hemp space just
because it didn't have the same plant
[SPEAKER_00]: count restrictions that the THC production
space had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew if we wanted to actually breed
plants the way that you need to to move
[SPEAKER_00]: this crop forward, you were going to have
to have really, really large numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: access to an actual bank account,
relationships with universities and other
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really the way to move
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say that the way that you're
doing breeding is different than kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional breeding that's going on in
the cannabis space, is that what you mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're able to do it at this large
scale and kind of do it the proper way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we say proper way, not just
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously with any type of information,
the larger your sample size is,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more accurate your underlying data is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, we were really bucking the
trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is that it's present in the THC
breeding side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't say that all THC breeders are
doing this, but because it's illegal and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's essentially still an underground
activity, even for the folks that are
[SPEAKER_00]: operating in state legal production
programs, there's always the overhang of
[SPEAKER_00]: federal interference, which means that you
can't run huge numbers and you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on some very specific
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also don't have the freedom to do five
generations of inbreeding with a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: variety before you outcross it to create
your field ready versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the THC side of things, a lot of
times you see people that are taking sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel and crossing it with purple kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the resulting plant is purple diesel
or sour kush or whatever it happens to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, the offspring of those two
plants, well, you're going to end up with
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe one out of 20 phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just amazing and great for
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can clone that and then grow your
small canopy on the THC side.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a breeding perspective, you just
created an absolute mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to produce a uniform crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it polyhybrid pollen chucking is
the term that's used by people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the actual line breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And line breeding is difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes years to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average development cycle for one of
our varieties is about three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes from the time that you
actually identify your standout in a
[SPEAKER_00]: population, to inbreeding it in isolation
tents, self pollinating repeatedly for
[SPEAKER_00]: generations and testing each one of those
generations to figure out which plants
[SPEAKER_00]: have the traits that you're looking for,
both from a chemical phenotypical and now
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes as well, making sure that you're
getting what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you've identified 10 to 20
standouts, four or five generations into
[SPEAKER_00]: that process, you then outcross and
perform field trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those field trials are where you
actually get to see which of your inbred
[SPEAKER_00]: population, which of your inbred plants
ends up producing the best field
[SPEAKER_00]: production populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we end up in a situation like that,
we may think we have 20 amazing plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in reality, we narrow it down to one
or two that ends up becoming a production
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We throw away 99.9% of what we start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a different situation,
I think, most of the folks in the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: world are accustomed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be heartbreaking,
in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes progress requires
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant breeders on staff, it's so
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all obviously deeply, deeply love plant
life in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we know what our
goals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad to cut plants down, but it's also
to a certain extent a relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking the unknown out of the field
for a farmer and replacing it with
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you know is going to be a
stellar performer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, yes, it's sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, there's a bit of joy
knowing that you're actually making the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And are they just completely scrapped?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any way stacks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, stacks and stacks of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stacks of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We obviously we store their we store DNA
to go back and figure out you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, what was what was wrong with this
particular phenotype, genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, we we literally just we compost
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, now I want to step back a bit because
you're kind of talking about your process
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, taking a creating a new
variety and you had a great slide about
[SPEAKER_02]: this in your presentation in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll fully admit I got a little lost,
so I don't know if you got to help me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you start with your two parent lines
and you get your F1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take me through there from there,
because there are some terms like back
[SPEAKER_02]: crossing and selfing that I'm just not
familiar with, but I'd really like to try
[SPEAKER_02]: to kind of understand the process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that slide, what what I was
basically starting off with were two very
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse parent plants and what it would
take to actually go through and identify
[SPEAKER_00]: segregation in your resulting population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more common approach is to take two
plants that you think are distantly
[SPEAKER_00]: related and inbreed each one of those
lines repeatedly over and over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: until you get to the point where you have
a highly homozygous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically homozygous at most critical
loci in a way that leads to predictable
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes and chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me stop you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have the two plants, you cross
them, you have a generation after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, step back from that for just a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you find a plant that has a
great chemical profile, regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step in that process is to self
pollinate that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant is going to get inbred and
then you're going to pull the seeds off of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant and you're going to grow them
out and do exactly the same thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the ones that have the
characteristics that you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: self pollinate those, collect the seeds
and basically start the process all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you're continuing to self
pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not actually crossing it with a
sibling or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all through self pollination?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the quickest way to achieve
homozygosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you just described, say you've got
a great chemical result in the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to do that is to take one of
your self pollinated seeds and then back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross it to that original mom that had the
right chemical profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to stray away from that in part
because of what I was describing before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that most of the cannabis
varieties that are publicly available are
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a total mess and that self
pollination ends up leading to less
[SPEAKER_00]: variation and a tighter likelihood much
higher likelihood that you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: what you are actually looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to take that and then back cross,
sometimes that works to lock in the trait
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're looking for, but more likely
than not with the current population of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that's present in the world,
you're going to end up with just a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so where'd we stop there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're in the F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the magic happens to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your S2 population, or your F2,
S2 is best because then you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing siblings and it's a strict self
pollination regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find plants that have the
maximum amount of diversity that's present
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis in the F2 population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see tall plants,
you're going to see short plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see plants with giant
calyxes, small calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a diversity of olfactory
compounds that are giving them distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean to cut you off, but just to
review.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the product of that original
cross between the two distinct lines and
[SPEAKER_02]: then that self pollinated, that's creating
the F2s that have a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can definitely do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what I was getting at is from a
developmental standpoint, if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that has the chemicals that you
want, generally what you're describing
[SPEAKER_00]: right now is, give you a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working on varins, CBDV,
THCV, CBCV, et cetera, for about four
[SPEAKER_00]: years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we had finally found some plants that
had very high concentrations of the
[SPEAKER_00]: varins, it turns out that they have really
poor structure, not great smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're plants that you would just throw
away normally, but it does have that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific ability to produce divernalic
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take that plant and we cross it to a
plant that has all of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics that we want, but is
missing the divernalic acid component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that F1, then we go through and we
look for the plants that have the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration, that have the best
structure, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go through exactly what you
just described.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, I mean, this is the downside
of audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had some video on here, I'd throw
some slides up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're in the F2s and you're seeing all
this different variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I imagine that you find the best
performers and then repeat that process
[SPEAKER_02]: again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You inbreed those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, we like to repeat as long
as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the issues that we run into is
cannabis, it's an obligate out-crosser.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really likes to out-cross to other
plants rather than to itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of cases, these plants become
sterile fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in and of itself is an inherited
trait and it's something that we select
[SPEAKER_00]: against at first in our populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you basically just do it as much
as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the goal of, I mean, we've heard this
a lot lately, this notion of flattening
[SPEAKER_00]: the curve, quote unquote, taking a large,
what would end up being a large
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of people and in our case,
traits and spreading it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're trying to do with cannabis
by inbreeding it is to reduce the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of variability that's present.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the curve that we're trying to
flatten.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to create something that
doesn't have variation so that when you do
[SPEAKER_00]: out-cross it, you're going to have
something that breeds true for very
[SPEAKER_00]: particular characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so explain to me out-crossing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're doing all this inbreeding to
stabilize and then you say that you do an
[SPEAKER_02]: out-crossing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you're actually making the F1
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your true hybrid seed that will go into
a field for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done all your homework and now
you're doing the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out in the world for everybody to
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're basically just planting it in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's required to make that F1 are two
independently developed, highly inbred
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying before, you may have 20
plants in one of those lines that all seem
[SPEAKER_00]: great, but when you cross them to make
your F1s, maybe they don't perform as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as, and this is always the case,
there's one or two plants that just
[SPEAKER_00]: out-cross exactly the way that you want
them to and perform better than all of
[SPEAKER_00]: their siblings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, two independent lines to create
your one line that actually goes out to
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys are constantly doing this
coming up with new varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the new and interesting
ones you've come up with or the new and
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting varieties that you're excited
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: The big ones for 2021 are all compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the USDA gave us this insane,
well, it was Congress, but USDA is
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcing it, this scientifically
inaccurate 0.3 total THC concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of questions in the
industrial hemp farming sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean 28 days before harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean 14 days before harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it mean the day of harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it mean final products, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really difficult for folks who
are on the traditional CBD side of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really, really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to our pure CBG, these are
type four plants that we've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: on and been in various stages of field
trials and public release since late 2016,
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to those, we now have type
three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are high CBD plants that even on the
day of harvest and even after you've
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed them and they're in a store or for
sale online, they are compliant,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% compliant with that 0.3 total THC
requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to having a number of
different unique compounds that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be really useful for people
and enjoyable, I think on the consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: side as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: How has the season been for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: How has that shaped your season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hurry up and don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been the mantra.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been waiting for the FDA to issue
some guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of the manufacturers of CBD
products have been waiting for some
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance from the FDA and that has had a
very depressive effect on the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like there was some overproduction
in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were basically being yelled at by
farmers across the country for not being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to supply enough seeds for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built out an infrastructure capable of
producing enough seed to supply the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the market shrank by about 75% this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has definitely been trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that farmers are in a similar
circumstance as well, mostly because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're sitting on product from last year
and basically just waiting for the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government to give the green light to have
it out in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's going to continue for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know that Congress is willing to act
to be able to tell the FDA, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's time to move forward with
cannabinoids, which I think is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time coming, but it's
going to open the door up for other
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just CBD, but the whole pantheon of
cannabinoids, including THC, to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into both the food supply and to be
legitimate as something that people can
[SPEAKER_00]: consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one of the things you mentioned in
your presentation at CAMA 2018 that stuck
[SPEAKER_02]: out to me because I am a craft beer
enthusiast was these cannabinoid-free
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties that could maybe be used in beer
with the terpenes and everything as almost
[SPEAKER_02]: a substitute for hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really neat plants in addition to
being useful for beer flavoring,
[SPEAKER_00]: which to be perfectly honest, you could do
with other cannabis plants that have
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids in them as well, but this
just happens to get around a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory hoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also are able to produce some other
interesting compounds that go along with
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes and the other olfactory
components that would be very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very useful for basically
anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we're really excited
about getting out, working on improving
[SPEAKER_00]: them for disease resistance and getting
them out into the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that I would say though at
this point is that the hop industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly small compared to the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a niche market,
but it's something that we're excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about just from both the craft brewing
standpoint and then the union,
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing hops and cannabis back together
in some really important ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you had mentioned that hop
farming doesn't seem fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just 20 foot tall binds and you
have to replant 20% of all of your hops
[SPEAKER_00]: every year from downy mildew infections
and that kind of problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard and very labor-intensive to be
able to get the components from a hop that
[SPEAKER_00]: are a lot easier to do with a cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the issues of long-term
disease pressure popping up in your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less pesticides, less reinvestment
every year for the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be perfectly honest, cannabis is
capable at this point of producing more of
[SPEAKER_00]: the compounds that people want from hops
than the hops are themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know another thing that you guys have
been working on is auto flower varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: or early flowering lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the difference between those two
terms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will photo period crops be a thing of the
past?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think true photo period crops,
I should hesitate on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a place, but you have to
understand the underlying genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for flower timing and to be
able to identify the variants that will
[SPEAKER_00]: get you where you want to go in specific
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period plants will have a future,
but it's more about gene stacking and
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to use those to get you into a
period where harvest is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: preferential.
[SPEAKER_00]: A place like Tennessee or Kentucky,
for example, they have a very wet August
[SPEAKER_00]: and September and then everything just
dries out in early October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with climate change, this is
obviously going to fluctuate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: For folks like that, you want to have the
ability to harvest early and then also
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest late to maximize the usefulness of
your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is always going to be a
place for photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: To step back, the difference between an
auto flower and a photo period plant is,
[SPEAKER_00]: one is considered day neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll flower under 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photo period plant is flowering based
on relative day length.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created the first in North America,
the first auto flowering CBD plant in 2016
[SPEAKER_00]: and created the first auto flower photo
period hybrids in 2016 as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a bunch of field trials in late 2016
and then again in 2017 to demonstrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy of combining these two distinct
germplasm lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was really interesting and
driven home in 2018 even more so.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take these hybrids containing an
auto flower gene and a photo period gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you take these hybrids anywhere in
the country, they all react to photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period changes in exactly the same way at
exactly the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some slight variations depending
on which photo period gene you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it looks like is that these early
flowering hybrids, you can clone them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can maintain them, but they go into
flower roughly two weeks after the peak of
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early July across the country,
all of these plants go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it looks like based on the literature
is that this is basically creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more sensitivity to a shift in
red light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants pick up on that and go into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pretty good examples in the
literature about mechanisms and other
[SPEAKER_00]: model organisms using these same genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just happened to pick up on it and be
able to use this in our hybridization
[SPEAKER_00]: process to be able to create these F1s
that are predictable in flower timing
[SPEAKER_00]: across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge advantage to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What folks figured out after the first
couple years is that if you have a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: line that was developed in Colorado and
flowers consistently, it's done by early
[SPEAKER_00]: October.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take that to a different photo
period regime like Florida or Vermont or
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, the plants respond in a very
different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll end up not finishing until December
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to have that predictable
flowering time is a huge benefit to
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those great examples of where more
knowledge that gets generated by everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's engaged in this process in the
cannabis space ends up leading to much
[SPEAKER_00]: better products and better outcomes for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is particularly useful for
outdoor cultivation, which, correct me if
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wrong, is much more common in the hemp
space than the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free sunlight, free soil for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of production outside is much,
much lower than in the indoor space.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long, to be perfectly honest,
the only reason why indoor cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: still grown outside of producing seed for
large scale farmers on the NHC side,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's only because of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you drop that requirement and
strange requirements like 12-foot tall
[SPEAKER_00]: fences or an enclosed space and those
sorts of things, the total cost to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: outside just makes it much, much more
likely that people will be engaging in
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of production behavior.
[SPEAKER_02]: At Oregon CBD, you guys seem particularly
focused on resinous big buds producing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids and terpenoids for whether it
be supplements or pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys interested at all in maybe
going after the other markets of using
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp as a fabric, a plastic, a fuel,
building material, anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the main take home message on
this is that other countries, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: had legalized industrial hemp ahead of the
United States, I think they're a little
[SPEAKER_00]: further along in terms of their breeding
programs for things like fiber or seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we have the tools to be able
to catch up relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things that we're really
excited about for 2021 is being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce new varieties that can do those
things, particularly on the seed side for
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming seed as a protein source,
basically as a nutritional supplement in
[SPEAKER_00]: and of itself as a food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also being able to grow your
cannabinoid rich crop right next to that
[SPEAKER_00]: and being able to safely do that without
having any seeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was one thing I wanted to ask
you about because if I remember correctly,
[SPEAKER_02]: you had an Instagram post about being good
neighbors and being careful not to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: male hemp outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you could talk about
some of the dangers that come with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if your crop gets seeded,
you're going to lose 30% of your overall
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lose 50% of the weight of
your crop just because the plant's putting
[SPEAKER_00]: all of its energy into seed production
rather than cannabinoid or floral tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugely problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the production of certified seed
outside also very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of different issues that come
along with it that farmers really,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day, they're just trying
to grow a crop that's going to make them
[SPEAKER_00]: money and it's going to benefit people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something extra that they shouldn't
necessarily have to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very confident that in 2021,
we're going to be able to release seed
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that make that concern obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've figured out a way to get around
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result, we're so excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is, I think, going to push
forward the envelope of what people even
[SPEAKER_00]: consider possible with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The early results that we're seeing in our
experiments are the most resinous,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most pleasant smelling, most vigorous
plants that we've ever experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been growing cannabis for pretty
close to 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just amazing evolutionary jumps forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really excited to be able to talk
about this in depth at CanMed 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a great place to stop if I've
ever heard one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I let you go, I want to give you a
chance to plug your website or social
[SPEAKER_02]: media or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can people learn more about you and
Oregon CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, our website is oregoncbdseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on Instagram and Facebook as Oregon
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 41 strong scientists, plant
propagators, folks that are taking care of
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great company, family owned
and operated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just really excited to be providing
farmers with quality seeds that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we're more than happy to have
you and we're happy to work with Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, as you know, a family operation
over here as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we kind of see ourselves as sort
of cut from the same cloth in the regard
[SPEAKER_02]: that we both try to do what we can with
good science and good old fashioned hard
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, happy to have you as part of CanMed
2020 and we'll see you out in Pasadena
[SPEAKER_02]: this fall.
