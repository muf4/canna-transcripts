[SPEAKER_00]: There was a comment made that I couldn't
get rid of, is that in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: research is apparently in the private
sector, and in Canada, it's university.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's exceptions to the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree that Buffalo's on the border of
Canada and the United States, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still the USA, so I'm gonna present my
research that I have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my background is I have five board
certifications, professor of neurology,
[SPEAKER_00]: oncology, neurology, headache medicine,
and neuroimaging, and so I went through
[SPEAKER_00]: the academic world, and the last time I
gave this talk was at the American Academy
[SPEAKER_00]: of Neurology, where there was 400 people
in the room, and they had to get an
[SPEAKER_00]: overflow room to tell you the interest at
the neurological level in academic
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a tremendous interest,
and I would love to see more physicians
[SPEAKER_00]: come down for this meeting, because I
think it's well worthwhile to network with
[SPEAKER_00]: that physician group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna, as you can tell,
I presently run about 110 research studies
[SPEAKER_00]: with pharma, so I'm in bed with pharma,
big time, and in fact, when I talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: migraines, the last eight drugs that have
been FDA approved, which is worth,
[SPEAKER_00]: what, billions for each company,
eight different companies, I was part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the research team that did that at our
institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the institute, and I think the
most important part of it is the 13,000
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis patients that we actively see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you understand that this neuroscience
center sees about 1,300 patients on a
[SPEAKER_00]: daily basis, so all those 250 are
migraineurs, or headache patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we have a huge volume,
and the reason I chose migraines,
[SPEAKER_00]: being the director of the Migraine and the
Cannabis Clinic, it was so easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, I'm a chief of neuro-oncology,
so I was very much interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: glioblastoma literature in cannabis,
which is very new, probably more advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: in England and Spain, but also I run a
center in Europe called the MIND Clinic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's in Budapest, Hungary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a neuroscience center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a breakdown of our cannabis
clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 13,007, that's pretty up to
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the New York state medical
marijuana program, or cannabis program,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I like to call it, is quite regulated,
quite expensive, but I'm about 10 or 11%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the whole state seeing patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a significant amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can tell, chronic pain is 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go down the list of cancer
neuropathies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the chronic pain patients,
by the way, have cancer and other
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told the patients, I won't accept a
dollar from you in cash, but then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to fill out all this data, and that's your
sacrifice, and they, trust me,
[SPEAKER_00]: they agreed to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a huge amount of data intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't send patients away for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring them back, depending on the
disease state, but no longer than two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way, I'm gathering the data,
and I agree, as somebody who runs
[SPEAKER_00]: randomized studies, I'm gonna talk to you
about large population retrospective
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The criticism of cannabis research over
the years has been obviously that the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers have been relatively small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talk about legitimacy only because my
fight is not with the cannabis users or
[SPEAKER_00]: the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fight is to talk to the academicians,
the presidents of societies, and change
[SPEAKER_00]: their attitudes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know a lot of people in the
audience, Bonnie, Ethan, Dustin,
[SPEAKER_00]: have also had this fight for many years,
some longer than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a long-term fight, and I didn't
understand that fight until I got into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis about seven years ago,
which is when New York State legalized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the other reasons is that as a
migraine specialist who runs a large,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the largest migraine center in
the country, many of my predecessors,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people I looked up to, were actually
Gowers from England, who was a
[SPEAKER_00]: neurologist, a father of neurology,
or Osler, the father of modern medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: from Canada who developed Johns Hopkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: These individuals, in their books at the
Turner Center, in the last century,
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous century, wrote about use of
cannabis in the treatment of headaches and
[SPEAKER_00]: migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, that was probably one of the
most common cause, and O'Shaughnessy in
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcutta did the first scientific studies
of pain, endometriosis, went back to
[SPEAKER_00]: England to treat the queen at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something you all know is that
cannabis or marijuana has these extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: with the first, second, and third most
prescribed meds between 1842 and 1890.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know the history of what
happened, and I presume this audience
[SPEAKER_00]: does, look it up, review it, because it
really opens your eyes how politics,
[SPEAKER_00]: business, influence medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is two studies that I'm quoting
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I firmly believe that people ask me,
do I smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't even drink, and I don't smoke
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of these so-called alcohol is
being used for medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that many alcoholics become
alcoholics because of underlining anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: depression, PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom line is that, in my opinion,
more people use medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: medically than recreation, than we are in
the stat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Colorado at the beginning of my
search for this knowledge, and I went to a
[SPEAKER_00]: butt tender in Colorado, and I asked him
then, what's CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: What CBD products do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, we don't have many CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, so everything we have is THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody wants to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, how about my grandmother
who's got rheumatoid arthritis at age 78
[SPEAKER_00]: and needs some kind of cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reply was the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wants to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the fact, because in my
13,000 patient, the question I ask
[SPEAKER_00]: routinely, it's on the data, do you get
high from the cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I am giving you, and the answer is
in 99% no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is this population out there,
and I'm talking about medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: not recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people drink alcohol to get drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use alcohol on a daily basis
to maintain their quality of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna review that, but the
endogenous cannabinoids, which have well
[SPEAKER_00]: been discussed, and phytocannabinoids,
we all know these types and some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers are in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't believe in sativa and indica
and strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually use the type one, type two,
type three cannabis, chemovars,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I noted above here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clinical endocannabinoid
deficiency is something I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in, because as a neurologist,
I treat a lot of people with Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Parkinson's disease is a lack of
dopamine, Alzheimer's, a lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylcholine, depression, a lack of
serotonin and norepinephrine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these deficiency states in the
diseases that I treat on a routine basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the endocannabinoid deficiency
syndrome, and by the way, the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system is not taught in
medical schools, except for about 8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this obvious ignorance,
and I use the term ignorance loosely,
[SPEAKER_00]: that physicians don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they don't understand it,
a physician will then build those walls
[SPEAKER_00]: around them and say, not for my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to educate at the medical
school level about the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to commend Ethan Russo,
because he's one of the strong voices in
[SPEAKER_00]: this community that really tries to make
physicians understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say tries, because sometimes it
doesn't work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's already laughing, because he
knows I'm going to show that slide that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's very important to understand
that the endocannabinoid deficiency may be
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring in disorders beyond migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know the definition of
comorbidity, comorbidity means that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have one disease, and another disease
happens in that one individual that's
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically higher than by incidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, migraineurs have a higher
incidence of migraine than incidence of
[SPEAKER_00]: fibromyalgia, idiopathic bowel syndrome,
post-traumatic stress disorder,
[SPEAKER_00]: bipolar disorder, anxiety, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these circles envision a subset of a
population, which is rather significant,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you look at migraine,
the incidence of migraine is 12%,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, the prevalence rate is 12%
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In women, it's about 18%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in women between the age of 20 and 40,
it's close to 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 40% of women in here are migraineurs,
if they know it, or maybe they don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I promise you that migraine is a
disorder that is tremendously easy to do
[SPEAKER_00]: research on, because we have a strict
criteria what a migraine is, based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: International Headache Society
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these disorders are natural to be
treated in our clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Pasadena, I think, recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time, I think, Dr. Mishol came to the
United States, and I had an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to him about his theories about the
use of cannabinoids in headaches and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, he's a pioneer,
and I don't know if we call it grandfather
[SPEAKER_00]: or godfather of research in cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know about all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna go through this,
because this, but this is the picture I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The individual way on the left is the
president of the American Headache
[SPEAKER_00]: Society.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at the American Headache Society,
Dr. Silverstein, then there's myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the one who's got the microphone is
Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one next to him is the next
president of the American Headache
[SPEAKER_00]: Society, and coming from London,
England, originally from Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: which maybe I, I'll leave his name out for
now, but the bottom line is, as Ethan is
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately answering a question in an
audience much bigger than this,
[SPEAKER_00]: he got up and said, this is bullshit,
and left the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't see that in academic
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you don't see it in many places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope Dustin doesn't come up here and say
this is bullshit and pushes me off the,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he has that potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him dance yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a potential for a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom line is, this is really,
this just tells you the internal
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance from academic medicine toward
individuals who have really put their
[SPEAKER_00]: academic career and their life for a cause
as advocacy and with science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just tells me about headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now migraines I won't get into,
but I will tell you that migraines is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most common disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, according to the World Health
Organization, WHO, chronic migraines is
[SPEAKER_00]: the second most disabling disease in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is low back pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're a migraineur,
you can see how much one suffers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's episodic migraine, which is the,
on the left, you know, four to 72 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know our location, pulsating,
moderate to severe, aggravated by causing
[SPEAKER_00]: physical activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have migraines with aura, but that's
only about 15 to 20% of all migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people say, oh, I don't have an aura,
so I don't have a migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chronic migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% of my clinic is chronic migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: By definition, more than 15 disabling
headaches a month, of which eight have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be migraineous lasting more than four
hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the definition of International
Headache Society definition of migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a prodrome, which could last 24 to
36 hours, where you have mood changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: cravings.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, everybody thinks,
well I ate chocolate and now I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chocolate caused a migraine,
where in fact, maybe the craving,
[SPEAKER_00]: a hypothalamic phenomena, is the cause of
your craving for chocolate and it's part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the migraine itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aura occurs in 15 to 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headache phase, post-drome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the numbers are huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to try or study a disorder
in medicine, then migraine is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these patients are quite frequent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're frequently in our practice and
quite easy to treat, because migraineurs
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to have a higher medical knowledge
than non-migraineurs, and that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna go through the
pathophysiology, but it's interesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cortical spreading depression is an
electrical phenomena that was outlined by
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes to the migraine
generators in the brain stem, the raffae
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclei, the locus serrelius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then through the trigeminal
vasculature, we have CGRP being a new
[SPEAKER_00]: entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now CGRP, I listed one, two, three,
four CGRPs, but there's three other ones
[SPEAKER_00]: called, also I studied seven CGRPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All seven were approved by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I'm a superstar in headache
medicine, because the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: companies love us, because we did the
study and that was not just at my
[SPEAKER_00]: institute, it was a multicenter study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other G-pans I called, the ones listed
are pathophys, the ones on TV,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ubrella V, Neurotech, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triptans came out in 1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that's gonna change headache
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ergotamines we don't use anymore came out
in the 1920s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Botox, which is neurotoxin,
is still approved for chronic migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also do research in neurostimulators,
and then I add cannabis at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about chronic migraineurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with chronic migraine, by the IHS
definition, they have low anandamide
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked about, can you do spinal
taps on these patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a study looking at spinal
taps on patients with migraines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking at anandamide levels,
or endocannabinoids, and by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: in chronic migraine, they're low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly believe that when I see a patient,
and I see a lot of patients, is that some
[SPEAKER_00]: patients will respond to cannabis
wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, you've changed my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I truly believe that this is part of
the endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: where phytocannabinoids supplement
endocannabinoids in individuals who have
[SPEAKER_00]: low cannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anandamide levels have been shown low
in chronic migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some of the studies we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially we did 263 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we have more than that,
but we have to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: 88.9% reported improvement in the
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: 83% reported improvement in migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: 83% of patients reported improvement of
their headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 51% on all patients were able to
reduce their consumption completely or
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a chronic migraine study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the efficacy of medical cannabinoids
seems to be dependent on the ratio of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we use, because we know the ratios,
the one criticism on New York State
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid program is it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The positive is that it's regulated
relatively rigidly and strictly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appearance of distinct group of receptors,
type one, type two, I'm gonna show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting about this cannabis
and chronic migraine is I did that in
[SPEAKER_00]: parallel to CGRP monoclonal antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are shots given once a month or an
IV once every three months, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with these drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those drugs have been approved by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cost of that drug is about $8,000
a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now insurance companies have accepted the
research and are now paying for these
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs $8,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't pay for cannabinoids,
but they'll pay $8,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botox is about $6,000, five to $6,000 a
year for chronic migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the results of the studies,
albeit my study was retrospective,
[SPEAKER_00]: but parallel to the other studies I did
with pharma, and you can see the results
[SPEAKER_00]: in 171 patients, there was a 25.7% of
patients had a 75% improvement of
[SPEAKER_00]: headaches on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That number is remarkable, by the way,
if you deal with headache medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have neurologists in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you look at 63.2% had a 50%
improvement of chronic migraine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which the WHO has stated is the second
most disabling disorder in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 50% improvement of this population,
which is the worst of the worst,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the way, many of these have sleep
disturbance, co-morbidities, depression,
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety, fibromyalgia, go down the list,
irritable bowel syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a population that, now even 80%
said there was a 30% improvement on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these numbers are actually,
if you look parallel to the CGRP
[SPEAKER_00]: monoclonal anthrax, the side bodies that
were approved by the FDA are very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers, except one's retrospective and
the other one is randomized studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with academic medicine that
randomized studies have to be done,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the next question, who will pay
for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one here, 63% responded very
similar to all the CGRP monoclonal bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a cannabis and chronic
migraine in this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: 41.8% decrease in headache days per month,
and then average decrease in monthly
[SPEAKER_00]: headache days was significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis can work in chronic migraine
by improving the depressive levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: anxieties, analgesia, anti-inflammatory,
there's many reasons why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm purposed to not get into the
pathophysiology of how cannabis affects
[SPEAKER_00]: the central nervous system because a lot
of us have this information was given to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the cannabinoids I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question I ask, are you naive
or not naive?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a simple question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of my patients are in the 60 and
above, so most of them aren't quite naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll use this titration schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: In patients who are naive, I start lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients who are not naive, I start
higher, and I may give a higher THC comma.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're smoking it and they wanna
switch over because people are realizing
[SPEAKER_00]: that as much as we love our cannabis,
there's gotta be a way that we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: find better than smoking it or vaping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now vaping it has shown to be less toxic
to the lung than smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the literature has not come out with
cannabis smoking is associated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher incidence of lung cancer like it is
with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably because most people are not
smoking as much, although you're inhaling
[SPEAKER_00]: it deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure that literature is gonna
stand for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you remember, I'm an oncologist too,
so I have to respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cost barrier is the major issue for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I treat patients, I bring them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't come back, I give them a
call.
[SPEAKER_00]: My staff does and says, why did you not
come back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't you go to the I-STOP?
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the I-STOP, which is that
regulatory state run system that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: when they pick up the opioids,
the benzodiazepines or the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they didn't go pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked them, why didn't you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the numbers are straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I looked at zip codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at all the people who went and
said, I can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at zip codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do I have to tell you what the zip
code showed in my part of the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: western New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: The zip codes were downtown Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was totally on income and race,
which is why we put these systems
[SPEAKER_00]: together, it's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of meetings with politicians
who say, look, you put a system together
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just not working for the
population that we need to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: cognizant of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the barrier says, so this is the
article I recently wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cannabis and migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I urge you to review that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my conclusion is that the cannabinoids
work because they're anti convulsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I, migraine is not a
seizure, but migraine has ion channels as
[SPEAKER_00]: has epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may be a correlation,
analgesic, anti-imatic, anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a promising compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do need rather than my study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few things here of
post-concussive headaches and chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I can tell you in this study we've
done, 80% showed subjective improvement on
[SPEAKER_00]: post-concussive and chronic pain,
80% improvement with sleep, sending
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the treatment I use usually is a 20 to
one oral tincture, which I titrate slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is something in the opioid
epidemic we have right now, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: real serious problem that has to be
