[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is TJ Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to be talking to you guys
about the chemical origins of fruity and
[SPEAKER_00]: savory exotic cannabis aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why are we looking into this and
why should we all care about why cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: smells and tastes the way it does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of when consumers are going to
a dispensary and they're making their
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing decisions, a lot of it may be
based on THC contents, obviously a very
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known quantity in the industry,
bag appeal, especially when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about things like how the flower
bud itself looks, or when you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at concentrates, what's the color of the
concentrate and the consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another thing to consider is also how
does it smell and taste, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When a consumer takes this product home,
they are going to smoke or consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some predisposition or some
thought about what it's going to smell or
[SPEAKER_00]: taste like when they bring it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's something they enjoy,
it's going to be something that may drive
[SPEAKER_00]: these decisions for why they decide to
repurchase said products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the realm of cannabis has this broad
range, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can range anything from gassy and
sweet, woody and citrus, spicy,
[SPEAKER_00]: creamy, even things such as grape,
tropical, gassy citrus, skunky,
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical, or even more nuanced things like
papayas and pineapples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is some of the chemistry that
we know right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is a Sankey diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a Sankey diagram does is it breaks
down the metabolites of interest into how
[SPEAKER_00]: they are based on weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are proportional to the
weight that's inside the actual cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flower material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously cannabinoids take up a large
portion of it, specifically THCA,
[SPEAKER_00]: because what I'm looking at today is high
THC cannabis, but then also breaks down
[SPEAKER_00]: into other things like other class,
which would be flavonoids, fats,
[SPEAKER_00]: waxes, and aroma compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In aroma compounds, you break down to
things like terpenes or flavorants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are a subclass of flavorants,
but for the purposes of this, I will keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flavorants break down into esters,
alcohols, aldehydes, can of sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of the lowest weight
content materials in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they may have some of the highest odor
impacts to the actual material itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the aromatic categorization of
cannabis, as we know it today,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously we have prototypical,
that's your traditional O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush's, things like wedding cake,
gorilla glue are very spicy, herbal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and gassy, as well as Jack Herrers and
Hases that have some citrus notes to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: very piney, very terpenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start thinking outside of the
classical range, you should think of
[SPEAKER_00]: things about like sweet exotics and savory
exotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started this, we really wanted
to understand what makes sweet exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis smell and taste the way it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we know a lot about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are in the plant that's been
studied heavily, but what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations in the plant that lead to
make a strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like zittles have some of its unique candy
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more exotic berry cannabis like Blue
Icey, Blackberry Kush have their dark
[SPEAKER_00]: berry notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we were going through this,
we were running some sensory panels
[SPEAKER_00]: internally and asking people free
questionnaires like, hey, can you please
[SPEAKER_00]: describe this cannabis in as liberal terms
as you can, be open and honest about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were originally starting to look at
just how to sweet differentiate from
[SPEAKER_00]: prototypical, and we were using actually
garlic cookies as a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of our panelists, we asked him
like, hey, is this, would you consider
[SPEAKER_00]: this a exotic or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, it's not a sweet
exotic, but in the context of is it
[SPEAKER_00]: prototypical, no, not really either,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a savory exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we started going through this,
we're wondering like, hey, is there
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry behind this that explains how
there's also savory exotic in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you start seeing the trends in the
industry today, we're seeing things like
[SPEAKER_00]: Donnie Burger and Hot Roast coming in more
popularity and the meat breast strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously funny name, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just how the industry goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are new, more new on strains
that are definitely not sweet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're also not prototypical either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to be some chemistry there
that can explain those differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started everything from
specifically rosin in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we used rosin was it allows us
to get more, a higher concentration of the
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile flavorants than flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flour has a range of half percent to three
or four percent, depending on the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar of choice, whereas rosin can vary
from five to 15 percent, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar and how it's extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows us to get a homogenous
sample going on to our GC.
[SPEAKER_00]: When someone makes rosin, they're using
multiple plants that are going through its
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take just a singular flower bud,
you're pulling it from just one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on where you pull from the plant
may have different impacts on the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows us to get a homogenous sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has minimal processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not worried about solvent carryover
or solvent contributions to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just strictly allows us to get what is
truest to the sample with as minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: processing and most homogeny possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the data that came through
our initial sensory panels, we're running
[SPEAKER_00]: through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have on top our four most sweet
varieties, and on bottom our four most
[SPEAKER_00]: savory varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see on what we have here are
density plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows us to demonstrate how much
some of these terms were used to describe
[SPEAKER_00]: these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like grape pie dosido had a lot
of sweet, fruity, dark berry notes
[SPEAKER_00]: claimed, and things like papaya peach and
juice man had a lot of sweet fruities,
[SPEAKER_00]: while some tropical and citrus notes being
claimed, but not very many savory notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the savory varieties had a lot of
these savory, elatious, sulfuric chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: notes coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we did this is with the
study, we really wanted to correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: trends in sensory data to actual hard
chemical data on the samples that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can start to find certain
compounds that are highly responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: why these strains smell and taste the way
they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look, something you'll notice
as well is that all of these all have the
[SPEAKER_00]: prototypical aroma of cannabis always
noted within these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are slight variations from cultivar
to cultivar, but it is always there,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really important to note.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the first things we wanted to
know is, is any of the exotic aroma due to
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically the main terpenes that are
present, the major weight compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we plot here on the left in
figure A is we have exotic score from zero
[SPEAKER_00]: to 100, how it was ranked by the panel,
as well as where that ranked in relation
[SPEAKER_00]: to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you look through the plot,
there is no real trend between any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: major terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of all over the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing on the right when we try and
trend, is there any specific trends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trends with the total number of aroma
classifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the context of sweet exotic there was,
when it gets more sweet exotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets a lot to the consumers,
it's more nuanced, it gets more difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to explain, so you get a lot more
descriptors versus savoring prototypical,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not as much correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead and looked at how all
these correlated to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have here is a correlation matrix
from decreasing exotic score from the top
[SPEAKER_00]: to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this plot allows us to do is
compare each cultivar to one another from
[SPEAKER_00]: all their sensory descriptors and say,
hey, how are these similar or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any relationships between each
cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the lighter the color, the more
similar they are, the darker the color,
[SPEAKER_00]: the less similar they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noticed there was a huge diversity
here, which was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted a lot of diversity because
that allows us to then start looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemistry, find trends, and start to
understand more about this complex field
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something was interesting, we saw gorilla
glue was, this specific sample was very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to garlic cocktail number seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back to that a little bit later,
but it's important to note that these
[SPEAKER_00]: should not really have much similarity,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have our sensory data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can go in and start actually doing
some of the hard chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're doing is we're using GC
cross GC with a TOF mass spec detector and
[SPEAKER_00]: an FID.
[SPEAKER_00]: GC cross GC is a type of two-dimensional
gas chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is allows us to employ a
traditional gas chromatograph where you
[SPEAKER_00]: separate based on compound size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then at the end, it has a pulsed flow
modulator, which allows you to then
[SPEAKER_00]: separate on a second column in that same
GC, but then by polarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get a greater degree of
separation and you can see more of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in these samples than what you'd
originally have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we were going through this,
we used, we built out a custom standards
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of our quantitation, worked with
different standards, companies to get as
[SPEAKER_00]: many compounds as commercially available
in an actual calibration standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these can based on calibrated values
and really try and find these trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also using direct injection overhead
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows us to get as accurate
reproducible data as possible and get more
[SPEAKER_00]: mass on column and see more of those low
analytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of these, like I showed in the
Sankey diagram, are very low weight
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a high chance that you may not
be able to see it if you don't get enough
[SPEAKER_00]: material on the GC itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the data we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran through all 30 samples,
ranking from super savory to classical to
[SPEAKER_00]: exotic, and everything pretty much looks
the same when you look at a top-down view
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you see on the GC is a lot of
the major compounds, which don't
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiate that much between cultivar
to cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you look at it, and it's like,
here we have grape pie docido,
[SPEAKER_00]: our most fruity exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And GMO, our most savory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chromatograms look almost
identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monoterpene region looks very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sesquiterpene later region looks
almost identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna dive deeper into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we know aromatically from sensory,
these are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell different, they taste
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the GC data looks very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means there must be some minor
compounds that are heavily contributing to
[SPEAKER_00]: these differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went back to our correlation
matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of looking at actually just
the sensory differentiation, now let's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do it on all analytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on the left, we have all analytes
detected for the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it into a correlation matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is based on how light it is,
how similar they are, how dark it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: how different each strain is to one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some differences,
but not a ton, to be honest, other than
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum zittles, gorilla glue,
and trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trainwreck, obviously, is a high-terpening
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trainwreck is a high-terpening base
strain, which is one of the few
[SPEAKER_00]: terpening-based rosins we actually find in
Southern California for this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one is gonna be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go down now and break it down,
well, let's look at just compare just
[SPEAKER_00]: monoterpenes and monoterpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see a lot of heavy differences,
again, showing that monoterpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: monoterpenoids, while important to
cannabis, aren't the differentiating
[SPEAKER_00]: factor in these exotic aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go further and look at
sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: they look almost identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all 0.95, 0.99, or even 1.0
similarities, meaning they're 95,
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you take it a bit further and
you'll adjust the flavor and remove
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else out, move all the
terpenes, monoterpes, sesquiterpes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see huge differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you start seeing a lot of
the variation between these cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that plot now looks a lot more like
our sensory correlation matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we started looking at data,
we found is a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: flavorings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of the key ones we
wanted to call out, because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: really important to these various aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all well-known compounds,
by and large, in the traditional flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry realm, but not necessarily in
the context of cannabis and what it does
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the fruity side, fruity floria,
things like methylanthronylate,
[SPEAKER_00]: really common, like concord grape,
purple grape soda flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the really interesting ones are
the creamy sweet compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like 6-amyl-alpha-pyrone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these are compounds in that
realm that are purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very much your stone fruit,
coconut flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical napthill, these are heterocycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never really seen nitrogen
heterocycles in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think about flavorings,
we're thinking of carbon, oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are super interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropical citrus is a new class of tropical
sulfur compounds in cannabis that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been found other places,
but these are driving some of these unique
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor notes that are in tangy strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: These weird citrus notes you don't get
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusil, sweet, these are synecuates.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are when you're thinking of,
think of strains like zittles,
[SPEAKER_00]: runts, gelatos, really heavily in zittles,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: These compounds give it that what makes
zittles unique and different from other
[SPEAKER_00]: exotics that are even berry notes is these
synecuates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synecuate compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the fruity sweet, these ethyl
butyrate, ethyl isovalerate, really
[SPEAKER_00]: important estery, very sharp top note that
helps, again, push this aroma for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you think about savory
exotics, why do these GMOs, these garlic
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies, have this unique scent to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we found when we were looking,
comparing our sensory data to our GC data,
[SPEAKER_00]: we noticed as there are some key
non-terping compounds that correlate with
[SPEAKER_00]: this intensely savory aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was indole and scatol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scatol is found in human feces and
mammalian feces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives poop its smell and has a wider
range of aromatic impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used heavily in the fragrance
industry as well, because depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: dose where you use it, it can impact
things from what we know as savory,
[SPEAKER_00]: garlicky, and cannabis, all the way to
just chemical, naphthol-like mothball
[SPEAKER_00]: scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very, pretty off-putting, to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is if you look at
its chemical structure, it's actually very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to what you see in melatonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, indole and scatol,
pretty ubiquitous in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to see in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to highlight just how difficult it is
to actually see these, this is just,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're looking here is GMO rosin,
which is some of the richest in these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds we've measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top plot there, you have a linear
scale highlighted in the box with the red
[SPEAKER_00]: circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you put it on a log scale and start
really blowing it up, you can see it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to zoom into the region
and see that there's these tiny little
[SPEAKER_00]: peaks that are really buried in the
chromatogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this was on a one-dimensional GC,
it would have been incredibly tough to
[SPEAKER_00]: find this unless you already knew they
were there and built a method for
[SPEAKER_00]: detecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these were, again, kudos to the
scientist, to the analog chemist working
[SPEAKER_00]: on this, Dr. Ian Oswald, for finding
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really buried in there, but these are so
important to why GMO chem dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: these various strains smell and taste the
way they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just another interesting piece about
these, scatol is very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,3-di-indole-methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a CB2 receptor agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That specific compound has promising
anti-cancer properties for certain cell
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is found in various vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that compound is, it is two scatols
bonded together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe scatol has some impacts for
different aspects of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's the mood effects or
additional properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then getting more into now the tropical
VSCs, these other compounds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being, when we looked in our data,
correlated heavily with why do these
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical and petroleum citrus strains
smell so unique and different from other
[SPEAKER_00]: strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: We noticed is there's
threemurcaptohexanol, threemurcaptohexyl
[SPEAKER_00]: acetate, and threemurcaptohexylbutyrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, this is the Gorilla
Glue I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had similarities with garlic cocktail
number seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garlic cocktail is a very petroleum citrus
tropical strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Glue's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Glue actually, and when I went and
procured the sample for the study,
[SPEAKER_00]: we went and got it as a control for our
sensory panel to use, because Gorilla Glue
[SPEAKER_00]: should be very spicy, herbal, some
gassiness, earthiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we brought it in, I remember opening
it in our sensory panel, and I smelled it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting ready to do sensory,
and just knew on the spot, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was not a real Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Glue does not smell tropical,
and this just kind of sucked for the
[SPEAKER_00]: study, because you're hoping to have a
nice control, but it's also positive as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good use case that can show how
you can use the chemistry of cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: start authenticating our certain strains,
the ones that we say they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry is well known to have renames,
people borrowing genetics from one
[SPEAKER_00]: another, things can be lost in translation
over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the chemistry doesn't change if the
strain is, cultivar is what it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this shows, very heavily so,
this Gorilla Glue is not a Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much a tangy type, because
Gorilla Glue would not have these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, these are some of the synecuates
we identified in, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the zittle strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a new class of flavor compounds
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have aromas arranged from fruity,
banana, pear, green apple, they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: top-note heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these don't exist, and other
fruits, some do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are also not commercially available,
so we had to go in the lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetically create, purify, and isolate
all of these, and put these through our
[SPEAKER_00]: sensory panel to see what do they smell
like, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can't just go buy this online
and bring it in and taste it, so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: only smell it, but what is their aromatic
contributions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really what helps
differentiate zittles differently from
[SPEAKER_00]: other exotic cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important to note that this is
not present at all in OGs, and other
[SPEAKER_00]: mildly exotics, and not these really
intensely sweet, fruity ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to see is just aroma percent
and some of these specific major class of
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, do they dictate aroma quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know they don't push the exotic
notes of these, and it's not correlated to
[SPEAKER_00]: the exoticness of cannabis samples,
but does it relate to the aromatic quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sensory panel?
[SPEAKER_00]: So relating the aromatic fraction,
weight, and the exotic score, and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see, again, with these major
terpenes, again, no correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavorants, you have this huge
correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monoterpenes, monoterpenoids, basically
flat-lined sesquiterpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: sesquiterpenoids, actually decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of makes sense, sesquiterpenes,
sesquiterpenoids are associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: older-age cannabis, typically,
because these are some of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: flash off the last, and they volatize the
slowest rate, so there may be some
[SPEAKER_00]: negative connotation there for some
panelists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just not just monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a specific monoterpene that
does drive some of these aromatic exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas, and the perceived exotic aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at them all, and really,
there was none.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all pretty much flat lines,
for the most part, indicating that,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, while these major monoterpenes are
important in the context of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't differentiate the exotic nature
of these various cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when to look in the bottom,
it's like, well, maybe it's related to
[SPEAKER_00]: flavorants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's related to the tropical VSCs in
the middle, or even the heterocycles,
[SPEAKER_00]: like indole and scatole in the bottom,
and what we notice is that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what those heat plots are showing,
is that as they get a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration, we start seeing more of
these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does trend with these compounds,
which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we were comparing the sensory data to
the GC data we expect of these written,
[SPEAKER_00]: this just further confirms that notion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with this, now we've been able to
expand our understanding of the exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis aroma spectrum, and able to start
fleshing out what is sweet exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, what are the compounds
responsible as fruity, berry, tropical,
[SPEAKER_00]: unique, citrus notes, as well as,
on the savory side, what's responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: those onion, garlic, chemical notes,
and get a broader, more in-depth
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of why exotic cannabis
smells and tastes the way it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the conclusions here,
we notice terpenes minimally, if it all
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced the perceived exotic nature of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small concentration compounds here,
flavorants, are really combining to
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily impact the unique attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scatole is one of the major components
with indole impacting that chem,
[SPEAKER_00]: funk, suuri, unique note, these elatious
note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really elatious, but it gets perceived
as such in these exotic savory strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the tropical VSCs really impact
those unique, tangy citrus notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the future work we're looking into is
looking at PCA and other statistical
[SPEAKER_00]: classification analyses, different
formulating algorithms to accurately
[SPEAKER_00]: predict some of these aromatic properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you relate these into more digestible
metrics for consumers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you're very sensitive and
understand that this is very hard
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very complex compound names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really mean much to an end
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting you have three mercaptohexyl
acetate on a container at a high level
[SPEAKER_00]: means nothing to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, it's probably scary,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are meaningful impacts to
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably a way we can use this in
a meaningful way to educate consumers in
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe various ranking scores and systems,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or other, there's gotta be another way to
educate consumers and at least help them
[SPEAKER_00]: move away from just THC and realize there
is other things at play, driving these
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences that they so much love and
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, structural solution of
other unknowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of other unknowns in these
cannabis cultivars that we have in salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis produces tons and tons of
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're publishing on these as we find these
and we understand the unique chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: that relates to the aromatic properties
and what these relationships are,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's still a lot more out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just one other thing I would like to
mention on this whole thing is that this
[SPEAKER_00]: can be oftentimes perceived as terpenes
are irrelevant in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not true, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When this study was originally published,
we saw a lot of articles out there take
[SPEAKER_00]: this and put in the context of terpenes
are irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not irrelevant, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we did this and we create a
lot of our different products,
[SPEAKER_00]: we stripped out all the terpenes and made
blends with just the flavorants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just all the fruity flavorants,
the chem notes, the thiols, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: except for the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has no semblance of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell terrible, but it doesn't
smell like cannabis at all because
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are the foundation or
foundational piece to why it smells and
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes the way it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps bridge and marry everything
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the right ratios, everything,
that can give you that symphony that is
[SPEAKER_00]: each cannabis aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'd like to acknowledge the
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge thanks to Dr. Ian Oswald.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavily led the study and found a lot of
why these things smell and taste the way
[SPEAKER_00]: they do with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twinkle and Manny Marcos did a lot of the
lab work, a lot of the data analysis with
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manny did all the synthesis of the
syneculates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin, our CSO, for always helping support
and helping drive this research forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to 710 Labs, great
collaborator of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provided a lot of high-end fresh rosin
that as soon as it was done, that way we
[SPEAKER_00]: could have ideal samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that isn't lost on us is that
the fresher the sample, the better the
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want as fresh as you can possible
because then the GC can only detect so
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then shout out to the rest of the
entire abstracts team, Cepsolve
[SPEAKER_00]: Analytical, Marks International for all
the help and collaboration over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'll take questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shelf life and delicacy of some of
these things you're finding, these esters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed from cultivation,
you pull down the stuff, it's great
[SPEAKER_01]: through trim, you package it, and you
start to lose a lot of these esters
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you looked at the data and the
delicacy of any of these compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for some of these fruity sweet
notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So not specifically to these sweet notes
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our first publication, we did look at
sulfur compounds and how they age,
[SPEAKER_00]: one, how it forms throughout the growth
cycle, where it forms during cure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then how it lasts throughout
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw with Prendelmer Captin,
which is responsible for the gas serum of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that really starts peeking around as
you're finishing cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then a week, week and a half after
packaging, depending on your packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: strength, you can lose 50% of those aroma
compounds by weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So packaging plays a huge role on why
these things are either retained and
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered to the end consumer or lost,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this just goes to highlight how
important curing is, storage, properly
[SPEAKER_00]: treating the plant because these are
delicate compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Esters are more volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of them, but a large portion of
them, like ethylbutyrate, is as volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: or more volatile than a lot of
monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a lot of these monoterpenes are
being lost in the first 30 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: start with these fruity estery notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can help mitigate that by proper
packaging scenarios if you're using a,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a mild, like think of your classical
sandwich baggies, right, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional days, the legacy days,
like it's not helping protect the material
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably gonna last a couple days
before it's fully dried out and you lose
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you have a really well-built
out packaging solution, because you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you put a lot of time and effort
in growing and curing that cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can get it in a nice packaging
scenario, you can help protect it to that
[SPEAKER_00]: end consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, TJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about stability, have you
looked at the stability of the various
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds and even worked with some of the
manufacturers to look at the stability
[SPEAKER_02]: from a flavor perspective and even a tox
perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: So from like a flavor perspective,
it's tough on flour for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when you have extracts, one of the
benefits are you have an ideal storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, you have more by weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have more that can be lost before,
like percentage-wise that can be lost
[SPEAKER_00]: before it has a specific aromatic
noticeable difference to the end consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also in an ideal matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be stored in a fridge or a freezer
to help protect those compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have we looked at the toxicology of
say one rosin or one flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at specifically compounds of
interest and what those toxological
[SPEAKER_00]: components may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because obviously we're using abstracts as
obviously a terpene flavor house and a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis extraction company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we care to see one, what makes it smell
and taste the way it does, but how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: do this in a safe or more acceptable,
meaningful fashion, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're not delivering anything
negative to our customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then consumers, but as far as how
rosin ages on a shelf, not necessarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least not in the context of this.
All
[SPEAKER_02]: right, if there are no other questions,
yeah.
Thank you.
