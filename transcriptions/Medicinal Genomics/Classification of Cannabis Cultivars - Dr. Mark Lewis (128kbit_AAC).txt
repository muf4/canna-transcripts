[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, I would like to thank Cortogen for
the great hospitality and the wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: conference, of course, and all of the
sponsors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Mark Lewis, founded Napro in
2011, and that was the result of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do at-home R&D piggybacked upon service
laboratories in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd always known that, you know,
I had a fond appreciation for plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'd always loved flavor and aroma and
high oil content, whether it was basil or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I tried to do R&D in 2007,
I had all these issues because I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get any type of consistent results from
lab to lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2011, Napro set out to accomplish
several tasks and do them as quickly as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we wanted to do was create
a robust and reliable, validated assay to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at and screen all of the relevant
terpenes and as well as some of the not so
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant or unknown ones, but we ended up
testing for and validating for 17 and 11
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then be able to communicate that data in a
meaningful way, not only to patients but
[SPEAKER_00]: also to plant breeders or physicians or
just the can of sewer, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who wants to learn more about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that time, we collected a bunch of
data from 2011 to 2015 looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the whole chemoscape of what
was popular medicine in California at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we had that data set, we did a few
different analysis on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first analysis was to really analyze
these cultivars, see what metabolites were
[SPEAKER_00]: present, and see if any patterns formed in
potentially like a classification system
[SPEAKER_00]: based on secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second analysis was to observe a
single genotype over many, many replicates
[SPEAKER_00]: in the exact same environment to see what
the real, you know, metrics are for
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency and quality to establish
quality metrics for certain clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analysis three, we wanted to compare
homozygous hybrid seed with the asexual
[SPEAKER_00]: clonal propagation to see if the RSDs from
plant to plant could be minimized versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the RSDs from lot to lot for the single
genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason this is important is because as
you learn as a chemist, all systems can be
[SPEAKER_00]: defined by the summation of your inputs
and outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So garbage in equals garbage out,
and that's for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the medicine we're taking, we don't
know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't black box that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for a plant, if you're giving it
stimulus, either environmental or
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical, you have to make sure you know
what those are so that you don't get the
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2011, we were provided a unique
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone had a series of controlled
environment production facilities and 56
[SPEAKER_00]: known cultivars by common name.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cultivars have been, you know,
grown by these same cultivators for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew that Blue Dream was Blue Dream,
and OG was OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I have quite an experience
with the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our team was able to match common name
with the actual genotype that was being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced, which kind of flew in the face
of some previous scientists who said,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in a name?
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, you know, there is a name
game out there because the marketplace
[SPEAKER_00]: demands cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have cookies, it suddenly
becomes cookies when it moves across the
[SPEAKER_00]: state line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the further you get across,
you know, the further the variation
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thought here was, well,
let's figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at how cultivating in the same
environment over and over again affects a
[SPEAKER_00]: single genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's do this thing like real people,
real scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through some of the
data that we collected and explain why it
[SPEAKER_00]: was good data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because we took painstaking
efforts to ensure that the lighting was
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The head space above the light was the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rooms were the same dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tables were the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil was sourced from the same
vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same techniques and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Napro oversaw the entire project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected climate metrics over the
course of the entire lifespan of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, making sure to produce control
charts, something that people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry often kind of have that starry,
deer-eyed look when you say, so that if
[SPEAKER_00]: there were out of bounds, situations,
you could eliminate that from the data set
[SPEAKER_00]: as a flaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly with the nutrient metrics,
we monitored what went into the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: system, what went on the leaves,
and made sure that it was consistent and
[SPEAKER_00]: the same across all batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we were spiking humic acid on day
40, it needed to be day 40 every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all part of the GE equals your
phenotype-chemotype equation that's shown
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we tried to do is minimize that
delta E part of the equation, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: that produced a phenotype, and we measured
those metrics via tape measure,
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the bud, height of the flower,
biomass, you know, pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took pictures along the way so that it
looked nice when you went from page to
[SPEAKER_00]: page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the pictures do other
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next piece was a little bit more
tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to actually collect the data from
the chemotype stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there wasn't any testing laboratory out
there that was really doing terpenes at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was just dabbling in it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we sought out to do was develop
this methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We paid to make it open source,
so anyone starting a laboratory anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: can download this guideline from sample
prep to your analysis, and you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable data for the cost of an HPLC and
a GCFID.
[SPEAKER_00]: We answered a lot of tough questions,
sample prep, extraction, textability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, intraday, some of these matrices
have degradation of certain terpenoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of other ones, so you have to be
really careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the RSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just take a look at our material and
data flow so you know that we thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at a living plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the morphological data,
combined it with the environmental data,
[SPEAKER_00]: took a sample, followed it through the
drying, curing process, collected that
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular show, we're going to
talk about the tier one assays we did,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a single extraction in ethanol to
create samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do one dilution for the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids less than 2%, greater than
30% falls outside the line of Beer's Law,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you have to do that dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people weren't doing dilutions in
2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just shotgun blasting it,
so we knew that there was RSDs associated
[SPEAKER_00]: on one side of the curve or the other,
which could explain the conformational
[SPEAKER_00]: bias of the increasing amount of THC found
in flowers through 2000 to 2015,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there was 36, oh, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we put that in the database,
create an analysis, create our control
[SPEAKER_00]: charts, and then it says MCF Sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really old name for what we
call a phytofax report, a report that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of gives you a flash of what that cultivar
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to name a few of the 56 cultivars,
we examined in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's everything from Pinchers Creek,
old Amsterdam, classic train wreck,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that you can imagine is on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are Girl Scout cookies on the
left, if you're curious, and Candy Land on
[SPEAKER_00]: the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'd make the presentation fun by
putting pictures of buds up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we haven't seen any yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all been really heavy, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forgot my joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the rainbow at the very
beginning?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a greenhouse full of weed at the
end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing we looked at was total
cannabinoid concentration across the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire population of 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the distribution here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a max of 36 or so percent
cannabinoids and a min of 10 with an
[SPEAKER_00]: average of around 20, which kind of jives
with what everyone's saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lot to lot RSDs average about 12%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the highly sampled
cultivars had lot to lot RSDs of 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 20%, which kind of, you know, Arno
Hoskamp's number of 15% falls right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen some things have more
variability and some things have less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just started to wonder,
do the things that have less variability
[SPEAKER_00]: have less of an environmental impact,
maybe more stable somehow with the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to look at terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total terpene concentration range from
about half a percent to two and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: percent with a mean is about 1.5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in indoor under artificial
lights, just to be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lot to lot RSDs were increased for the
terpenes, which kind of symbolized that
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpene biosynthetic pathways are more
influenced by epigenetic factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, we found that cannabinoid
content was more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terpenoid content between lot to lot,
one of the things that this brought up
[SPEAKER_00]: was, well, is there a correlation between
high terpene production and high
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid production?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at that, we saw that
there is indeed a correlation between
[SPEAKER_00]: higher essential oil production and higher
cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the correlation factor is really
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that only about 15% of the
factors influencing the terpene content
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from the cannabinoid content,
which means that 85% of that is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from somewhere else, whether it's genetic
or environmental, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The correlation's real, just really tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does that tell us about each
individual unique cultivar and how someone
[SPEAKER_00]: can use this tool to be able to treat
specific ailments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everyone says, well, what's in a
terpene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dustin started talking about linalool,
increasing efficacy, Mara talked about the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Dr. Machulam for coining the
phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like we have to look at each
individual terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we created this really, really,
oops, I skipped a slide, forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the whole spectrum of plants from
the low concentration of THC to high,
[SPEAKER_00]: low terpenes to high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're in four-letter code,
so it doesn't tell you a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just showing you the spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the individual terpenes themselves
were colored with color coordinated so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they would be intuitive, but also
informative and create what we call a
[SPEAKER_00]: phytoprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially the fingerprint of a
particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started this with basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this slide actually had basil where
the buds are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I think about if we could
grow a bud that big, how that might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty incredible, especially after
drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you imagine how big it would be on
the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially terpenaline is red,
osamine is orange, limonene is yellow,
[SPEAKER_00]: pineen is green, mersene is purple,
linalool lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can create collateral that color
matches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows different types of effects
that these things do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, you can look at
different cultivars and compare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a couple examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, if you look at the major
terpenes that are produced by the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really class off pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you have one major terpene,
two, or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more rare to have four, five,
or six all equal amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at bubacush, east coast
sardisal, and crypto, they both have high
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of limonene and cariophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you can see the mersene and the
linalool all disappears in crypto,
[SPEAKER_00]: which those subtle minor differences are
how you differentiate the subtleties
[SPEAKER_00]: between each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the bottom, you have classic perps,
blue dream two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just two because there are
multiple cups of blue dream, which I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure Kordogen knows about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then old Amsterdam, just a different
purple class.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this purple class because before
we put science behind it, we used our
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the purples tended to be mersene
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just call them purples because they're
purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it turned out that it worked out
in our color scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank god.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem if it didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the subtle differences
here in the pining and the cariophylline
[SPEAKER_00]: between the different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you really differentiate
each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're all really within these three
cultivars are across two classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at some archetypes,
there's a terpenoline dominant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with your train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limonene dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular is an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an OG legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mersene dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that was CBD prior to 2014 was
pretty much all mersene dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osamine dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Hawaiian plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of these things produce like
2% of a single terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pining dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beta cariophylline dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terpenes are important because beta
cariophylline actually is a CB2 agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're only testing for cannabinoids
and you're giving your child a
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation, you should be very cognizant
to the fact that when you concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: this, CO2, anything, you lose your
monoturps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you usually get a ton of the
cariophyllines, whether it's alpha or
[SPEAKER_00]: beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you hybridize two of these,
like the pining group and the mersene
[SPEAKER_00]: group, you'll get something that kind of
looks in between the two or a combination
[SPEAKER_00]: of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is interesting because you create
custom medicines this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could just buy a seed that was
the medicine you wanted instead of,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would you call it, the lottery?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a box of chocolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do a dendrogram of this
chemical data, you get a nice breakup of
[SPEAKER_00]: hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the terpene superclass system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just based on metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if pining is in the major terpene
world, then those cultivars fall in that
[SPEAKER_00]: family branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limonene, cariophylline, as such,
mersene, osamine, and terpenoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, limonene and cariophylline
seem to be quite coupled in osamine and
[SPEAKER_00]: mersene, quite coupled in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of neat trends you see here,
but just showing some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that bore the classification
system, where we wanted to do away with
[SPEAKER_00]: indica and sativa because we don't really
care about 20 years ago or 100,000 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, we care about right now and what it's
going to tell our patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you use a simple alpha system here
to outline what the top three terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, it's limonene,
cariophylline, and mersene for LCM.
[SPEAKER_00]: One means it's a type one plant,
and G means that cannabidrolic acid is the
[SPEAKER_00]: second most abundant cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have a quick cartridge of five
digit item code that would work in a QR
[SPEAKER_00]: system for inventorying at dispensaries
and totally removes the common name game.
[SPEAKER_00]: This led to having to do a PCA analysis on
the data points to make sure that a
[SPEAKER_00]: classification system would hold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ellipses are really great clustering
for different chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you notice the purple here,
the blue dreams, there's also Kin's GDP
[SPEAKER_00]: thrown in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually three cuts of blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have headband and several
different OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have purple train wreck and classic
train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not just the same genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it may be based on the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that the train wreck ones
aren't because one was purple and one was
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that the system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some genotypes have too much lot
to lot variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the course of, say, 40 or 80
runs, you have this plant that slides from
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two different classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're looking at OG Cush,
another great picture of a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an MCL1T class, as we designate it
internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's myrcine, karyophylline,
limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things have 2% turps always and
greater than 25% cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's truly a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: OGs are marked by equal amounts of
limonene, karyophylline, and myrcine quite
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at this phytoprint over,
say, a dozen or so runs, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: separation of a couple different classes
here where sometimes the limonene is
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant, sometimes the karyophylline is
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have this myrcine dominance
across here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this is highly contingent upon
environment and time of harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, and post-harvest conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have terpenes degrade to other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point here is that quality control
and laboratory integration with production
[SPEAKER_00]: is absolutely essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea of having third-party
laboratory services that you send samples
[SPEAKER_00]: to is kind of like, ah, to me,
because it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're just making pure extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're still waiting in a holding
pattern for your results and not even
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed if they're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have to send it to three
different laboratories, oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then how do you pick which one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you average them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So complicated, especially when,
I mean, this is the same genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: same environment over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at a control chart here for
total terpene content and total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid content, with, we ran a little
experiment just trying to check out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to speed up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the difference between organic
practices plus biostimulants, which
[SPEAKER_00]: biostimulants are that biome thing that
Kevin was talking about at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we take away the biostimulants
and just do organic practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see a significant decrease in both
terpenes production and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The producers didn't like that very much,
so we had to quickly change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's only a few data sets
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went to conventional
agriculture, salts, moved to salts,
[SPEAKER_00]: away from organic practices, and brought
the biostimulant back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a boost in THC compared to the
baseline and a decrease in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very interesting for us to,
as confirmed what the grower said all
[SPEAKER_00]: along, we had to do it this way to get the
oiliest, tastiest products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, there's a neat way
to boost your THC by switching to salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This variability in cannabis brings up the
quality question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry seriously lacks QA,
QC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most producers don't even have established
quality metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like you have to have size of
a, if it's a flower, you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: size, shape, color, all these things most
people don't consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only seed on the market you can buy
that's true breeding currently is cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, and it may not even be in most
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike corn, you can't just buy a
disease-resistant OG or a bicolored Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but people are making advances,
and one of our clients wanted to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: type two train wreck because this
particular person had anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she felt that Jack Herrera really made
her feel calm, and she wanted a type two
[SPEAKER_00]: version.
[SPEAKER_00]: This train wreck is really a TXX1G class,
which means it's terpenoline dominant type
[SPEAKER_00]: one with cannabidrolic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second most abundant
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a picture of the classic train
wreck right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very specific morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at total cannabinoid
concentration across all the individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: in the class, it's really nice and
homozygous all at about one to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say that we do everything
exactly backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start from the plant, you start from
the human.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humans say CBD to THC, and the plant
breeders say THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So such is life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the terpenes,
it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in the same class.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular dataset, there was like
70 individuals, but I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: clutter the screen with phytoprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that things are changing in
the world of propagation, and we should
[SPEAKER_00]: start thinking about this because the RSDs
from plant to plant here were less than
[SPEAKER_00]: the RSDs of a single cultivar from lot to
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This begs up the question of indica versus
sativa again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be better used as an
effects gauge than a genealogical
[SPEAKER_00]: nomenclature in the current system of
medicine, not taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So end on a set of sample reports I was
talking about before, where you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: top terpenes color-coded at the top and
the bottom to give you a feeling of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, total cannabinoids, terps,
and moisture content along with the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: A picture of the flowers that you can
visually identify the product tested with
[SPEAKER_00]: the product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have suggested entourage effects that
are based on algorithms and patient
[SPEAKER_00]: panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done over the course of 2011 to 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little flavor, spider graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a really cool way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warm tones are typically more stimulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool tones are typically more sedating,
so it's a very intuitive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
