[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everyone, I'm very excited to be
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Akeem Gardner, I'm CEO of
Cronerta Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are a pre-clinical biotechnology
company from Ontario, Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We specialize in looking at all the
prenatal flavonoids, the still beans and
[SPEAKER_00]: the benzyls in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I'm going to present to you one
of our research projects looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: glioblastoma invasion and survival with
cannabis thrives flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So canflavin A and B are prenatal
flavonoids found in cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a flavone backbone consisting of
two final rings and a heterocyclic ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 36 years ago, Baron et al identified
these flavonoids as inhibitors of the
[SPEAKER_00]: prostaglandin E2 production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she demonstrated was that they
had anti-inflammatory effects up to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: times more potent than aspirin,
but with a different mechanism of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that was presumably safer for us than
our NSAIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These molecules are highly lipophilic and
this nature allows them to easily
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate into cells and potentially
interact with membrane-brown enzymes and
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now recent studies have explored the
potential of these molecules in cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: One study found that canflavin A induced
apoptosis and decreased invasion in
[SPEAKER_00]: bladder cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 2019 study pre-clinical study found that
an isomer of canflavin B, cathinone,
[SPEAKER_00]: increased apoptosis in pancreatic cells in
vitro and limited metastatic progression
[SPEAKER_00]: in vivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FDA has recently granted an I&D to
allow them to further this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, none of these studies proposed a
mechanism of action for how canflavins
[SPEAKER_00]: actually interfere with cancer
progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier this year, we had this study
published in Phytomedicine Plus and in
[SPEAKER_00]: this study, we took a look at how
canflavins activity actually affected
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer and what the target of this
activity might be, track B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to take you through a little
bit about what we found today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, our work started off by
looking at a protein called the
[SPEAKER_00]: activity-regulated
cycloskeleton-associated protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: or ARK for short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of ARK like a super-smart scientist
in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important for helping our
brains adapt and learn new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our neuroplasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It plays a big role in how we think and
understand stuff, the brain's cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, ARK doesn't work alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a friend, the brain-derived
neurotrophic factor, or BDNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And BDNF is like a messenger that carries
the instructions to ARK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a growth factor, which means it helps
things grow and develop in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: BDNF tells ARK, oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, BDNF tells ARK to produce more of its
MRI and protein, sort of like telling it
[SPEAKER_00]: to clone itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does BDNF send this message?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does so through activating a special
type of receptors called the tropomycin
[SPEAKER_00]: kinase B receptor, track B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think of BDNF like a mailman,
track B is the mailbox, and ARK is the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist that reads the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, back in 2017, researchers in our lab
identified a bunch of compounds that can
[SPEAKER_00]: change how ARK gets produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found these molecules by
screening through primary mouse cortical
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the identified compounds,
five flavonoids enhanced ARK protein
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dietzine and ginsine were two isoflavones
that increased ARK protein levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: as demonstrated by nuclear ARK expression
measured via fluorescent immunostaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, we wanted to know, would
can-flavons act similar, would they act
[SPEAKER_00]: the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we adapted this previous experiment,
this time focusing on the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: can-flavon A and B on ARK protein
expression using the same primary mouse
[SPEAKER_00]: cortical neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our hypothesis was that can-flavon A
and B might actually increase the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of ARK protein when added to the neurons
that were already stimulated with an
[SPEAKER_00]: external source of BDNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, however, very surprisingly,
instead of seeing the ARK protein increase
[SPEAKER_00]: as expected, can-flavons at concentrations
between 1 to 20 micromolar actually
[SPEAKER_00]: prevented the normal increase in ARK
protein caused by BDNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was observed through Western blotting
and by examining the protein expression in
[SPEAKER_00]: the nucleus via immunostaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results that we found were actually
quite different than our initial
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our team wanted to find out if
can-flavons were causing the ARK protein
[SPEAKER_00]: to break down or if they were affecting
how the ARK mRNA was being copied,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a step before a protein is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do so, they performed an experiment
called the quantitative polymerase chain
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction, or QCPR for short.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fancy way of saying we were
copying and measuring the amount of ARK
[SPEAKER_00]: mRNA and we used two molecular scissors
that targeted different parts of the ARK
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing this, we discovered that
can-flavons at a specific concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 10 micromolar, stopped the usual
increase of ARK mRNA expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, putting this together with the
results from the early experiments,
[SPEAKER_00]: the scientists concluded that effects of
can-flavons happened after TREC-B is
[SPEAKER_00]: activated by BDNF, but before the
machinery that controls ARK expression
[SPEAKER_00]: gets switched on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use a little bit of
analogy to talk a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_00]: TREC-B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to imagine TREC-B activation
as a relay race.
[SPEAKER_00]: BDNF is the run-off runner at the start of
the line, and TREC-B receptor is the
[SPEAKER_00]: baton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the race starts, BDNF binds to the
TREC-B receptor, similar to a runner
[SPEAKER_00]: grabbing the baton.
[SPEAKER_00]: This binding leads to the dimeritization
of two TREC-B receptor parts, similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: two hands holding a baton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once these parts are together,
tyrosine residues on the receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are like the baton's marking,
get flagged or phosphorated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tagging recruits and activates halter
proteins, such as Schick or GERB2,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like signaling the next runner to
get ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we wanted to see is, would the
can-flavons influence this relay race?
[SPEAKER_00]: We focused on two important markings on
the baton, the Y515 and Y705.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, using Western blot,
we see that both can-flavon A and
[SPEAKER_00]: can-flavon B, like unexpected hurdles in a
race, slow down the tagging of these baton
[SPEAKER_00]: markings in a dose-dependent manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means the more can-flavons we add,
the less tagging happens, which ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: prevents the activation of the next
runners or downstream signaling cascades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue with the race analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the baton has been picked up and
the race is underway, there are several
[SPEAKER_00]: tracks that a runner can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like the signaling pathways that
are controlled by TREC-B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, you have MAP-K, ACT,
MTOR, and the S-16.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the S-6K pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of these pathways like the
different lanes in a relay race.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we decided to do was look at how
can-flavon A and B can impact these lanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using Western blotting, we found that
can-flavons A and B significantly slow
[SPEAKER_00]: down the runners in these lanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reduce the BDNF-induced increase in
MAP-K, ACT, and the S-6K pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our race analogy, if BDNF is the
starting pistol, it usually makes these
[SPEAKER_00]: runners or pathways speed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with can-flavons A and B, it's as if
they're running on a track filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: obstacles, slowing them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's more is that we noticed that the
changes in speed across these lanes
[SPEAKER_00]: happened independently of each other with
limited interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this suggests that can-flavons likely
set up their obstacles very early on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the race, right at the start of TREC-B
signal activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does all this mean for cancer
research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, TREC-B is a little bit of a
troublemaker in many types of cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes breast, liver, lung,
and very severe type of cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: of brain cancer, called the glioblastoma
multiform, GBM for short.
[SPEAKER_00]: GBM is the worst kind of brain cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's top level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can show up anywhere within the command
center of our body, our central nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: GBM has the ability to detect and it has
the ability to grow rapidly with
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can invade nearby cells, invasion,
and it could also send its henchmen to
[SPEAKER_00]: other areas of the body with metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess who's giving GBM these powers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, it's our problematic friend,
TREC-B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm supposed to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of its effects in the human body,
we often lose the war against GBM with
[SPEAKER_00]: survival rates less than two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current weapons that we have against
GBM, like surgery, chemotherapy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and radiation, can help us fight battles
for a while, but things often end up in
[SPEAKER_00]: relapse and GBM taking control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's very important for us
to understand and control the molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: abnormalities in GBM.
[SPEAKER_00]: As if we can figure out a way to take away
TREC-B's ability to aid GBM, this could
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to more effective treatments in our
fight against GBM and other cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our next batch of experiments,
we wanted to select a control that can
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that our work was valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the control we selected was ANA-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: ANA-12 is a unique molecule because it
selectively inhibits TREC-B with minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on other TREC family receptors or
RTKs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It crosses the blood-brain barrier and
noncompetitively antagonizes TREC-B
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors' lignin-binding domain,
preventing BDNF acts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 2017 study demonstrated the
dose-dependent efficacy of ANA-12 on U87
[SPEAKER_00]: GBM cells, assessing cell viability over
72 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal was to find out what happens
to these GBM cancer cells when we expose
[SPEAKER_00]: them to more and more of these TREC-B
inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, we started with ANA-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested out on two different types of
GBM cells, the A172s and U172s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at ANA-12 on U87s to
make sure we can get the same results as
[SPEAKER_00]: the 2017 study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we moved on to CAN5 and A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at CAN5 and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the bar graphs of the
results, you can see that as we increased
[SPEAKER_00]: the dose and the amount of time cells were
exposed to these inhibitors, the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: responded way more than when we just used
DMSO control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we wanted to see if these results
were the result of toxic molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one wants those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we conducted a cytotoxicity LDH assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And results showed low percentages of LDH
for CAN5 and A and B in both cell lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most doses exhibited 5% or less,
except for high dose CAN5 and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this indicates is that the
decrease in cell viability is not due to
[SPEAKER_00]: necrosis caused by the molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: To assess how these compounds inhibit cell
migration, we performed a 2D scratch
[SPEAKER_00]: assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we used a pipette tip to
scratch a monolayer of cells on a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then live time lapse imaging captures
the migration of GBM cancer cells with the
[SPEAKER_00]: addition of ANA-12 and CAN5s compared to
DMSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how they're moving here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, interestingly, what we found was that
the cells migrated faster with CAN5s,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then they slowed down after 48 hours
when you compare them to the DMSO control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we performed a 3D spheroid migration
assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after 24 hours, low doses of the
inhibitors reduced the number of area
[SPEAKER_00]: cells migrating from the spheroid compared
to the DMSO control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to see how these substances,
ANA-12, CAN-A, CAN-B, can affect the way
[SPEAKER_00]: GBM cells invade or spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do this, we used a Boyden-Chamber
assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a special setup where we put the
cells on a gel that represent the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment around the cells in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we give the cells about 24 hours
to do their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we clean up, and we add a
special dye to the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see them better under the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from our early results, it looks like
even small amounts of ANA-12, CAN-A,
[SPEAKER_00]: and CAN-B can slow down these GBM cells,
making them less able to spread through
[SPEAKER_00]: the gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good sign because it suggests
that these substances can potentially slow
[SPEAKER_00]: down the spread of GBM cells in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a nutshell, our research has first
found that CAN-FLAVAN-A and B are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: put the brakes on activation of a
particular signaling pathway in cells
[SPEAKER_00]: called TREC-B.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pathway is often overly active in
many forms of cancers, including those
[SPEAKER_00]: found in the breast and the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CAN-FLAVANS have demonstrated their
power against these GBM cells by being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to reduce the viability of these
cells and even better, doing this without
[SPEAKER_00]: any toxic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discovered that these CAN-FLAVANS can
slow down the movement of these cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was seen in both 2D and 3D
environments, with the cells moving slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: after 48 hours and 24 hours, respectively,
when compared against the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lastly, we also found that even in
small doses, CAN-FLAVANS were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease the evasion of these cancer cells
after just 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggests that CAN-FLAVANS have a
strong potential in slowing down the
[SPEAKER_00]: spread of certain cancer types,
opening up a new possibility of cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do we go to from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward, our team is eager to
continue this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the coming months, we'll start to
use cerebral organoid or mini-brain
[SPEAKER_00]: co-cultures to delve even deeper into the
potential of CAN-FLAVANS to halt cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moreover, we're preparing to utilize
assays that track the movement of cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: cells that express a glean fluorescent
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by pre-treating these cells with
CAN-FLAVANS, we aim to further investigate
[SPEAKER_00]: the compounds' capacity to put a stop to
cancer metastases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important to note that this is
just one branch of our comprehensive
[SPEAKER_00]: research programs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have amassed a significant amount of
data that underpin our ability to take our
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory findings and apply them in
living organisms in vivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, we have encouraged the
results from a trial involving transgenic
[SPEAKER_00]: C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a type of worm over-expressing a
human tau protein that tends to aggregate,
[SPEAKER_00]: a common feature in many neurological
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this trial, we used an extract of
CAN-FLAVAN A and B mixed at a three-to-one
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio and found that it had a modest
positive effect on the survival of these
[SPEAKER_00]: transgenic C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most crucially, in relation to what
I'm talking about today, we found that
[SPEAKER_00]: CAN-FLAVANS, at a variety of different
doses, do not cause neurotoxic effects to
[SPEAKER_00]: the living worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very promising discovery
when considering CAN-FLAVANS as diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: for the CNS and the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to thank you all for coming to
my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to acknowledge all the researchers
who have done well to perform this science
[SPEAKER_00]: and move us forward, including Jen
Holbring, the Lalong Lab, the Aptar Lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: our CNERDA team, Mitacs and CERC,
and the University of Guelph for funding
[SPEAKER_00]: this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very excited about the work we're
doing up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for allowing me to present
to you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very interesting work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious your perspective on these two
different entities, GBM and tau protein
[SPEAKER_01]: Alzheimer's dementia, in which the TRKB
pathway would be an important reparative
[SPEAKER_01]: and preventative pathway in Alzheimer's,
where you might not want to suppress it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you tease those two apart in the
role of CAN-FLAVANS in each of those
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're asking how do we adapt the data
from... I'm just curious your thoughts,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Inhibiting TRKB could be useful in GBM,
but it seems like in models of
[SPEAKER_01]: Alzheimer's, increased TRKB activity is
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have another
presentation a little bit later today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunterland at BRC will take you a little
bit more through the transgenic C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans study.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we looked a little bit more at tau,
and in order for me to not step on his
[SPEAKER_00]: toes, I'll let him share with you what we
found about tau and Alzheimer's in regards
[SPEAKER_00]: to CAN-FLAVANS, but also cannabinoids as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's most important, I think,
from this is that we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: glioblastoma to less than two years
survival, and people and patients are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for anything that can help prolong
the survivability of these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we found in these models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the thing that we were most
excited about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering, are there other
therapeutics that are being developed at
[SPEAKER_02]: target TRKB?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering, what's special about
the FLAVANS from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem like some of the most expensive
FLAVANS I could get, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know if you can actually get
them, which is why we're excited about the
[SPEAKER_00]: work that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These molecules are extremely rare in the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually found in under 0.014%,
so you're never going to get these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules from spoking our medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where our company specializes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a variety of different production
processes to allow us to capture them in
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical and commercial quantities so that
we can now do this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we originally said, these
molecules were first discovered to have
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely high anti-inflammatory
properties, but a different mechanism of
[SPEAKER_00]: action than most of our NSAIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The different mechanism of action
presumably allows them to be safer than
[SPEAKER_00]: most of our NSAIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that systematic chronic
inflammation is the root cause of many
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from cancers, tumors,
neurodegenerative diseases, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth, starts with chronic inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are like millions and zillions of
sort of anti-inflammatory or reductive
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm interested in what's specific
or curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to follow up with you more
and hear more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what do you perceive the route of
administration will be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, these won't survive pyrolytics,
and it's kind of probably be either oral
[SPEAKER_03]: or injected.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what do you anticipate there for
route administration?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of interesting
research projects that are going on right
[SPEAKER_00]: now that we're following very closely to
see what the best way of delivering these
[SPEAKER_00]: to the site of action in GBM.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, the FDA has
recently granted an IND to cathinone,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in their IND, they're using smart
radiotherapy biomaterials to deliver it
[SPEAKER_00]: straight to the site of action alongside
chemotherapy and without.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll learn as the science continues to
progress, and we'll also continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: explore our own routes of administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
