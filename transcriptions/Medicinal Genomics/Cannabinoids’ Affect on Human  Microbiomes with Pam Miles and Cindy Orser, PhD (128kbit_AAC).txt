[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Can Med Coffee Talk podcast
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the Can Med Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you gotten your invitation to Can Med
23 yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, then head over to canmedevents.com
now and request your invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Can Med 23 is an invitation-only
event this year due to the limited
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity of our new location, the Marriott
Marco Island Beach Resort in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say it's a small event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can Med 23 will feature three full days of
cannabis science content featuring more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 30 presenters and instructors
representing our key focus areas of
[SPEAKER_00]: science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And new for Can Med 23, we will also
explore psilocybin and psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out all the information at
canmedevents.com now and I hope to see you
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, I talked with Cindy Orser
and Pam Miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pam is the CEO and founder of Apothecare,
a company that partners with scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: performing women's health research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cindy is currently chief scientific
officer at Clip Labs, a cannabis testing
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she has more than 25 years of
experience innovating technologies related
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis, human diagnostics,
and even detecting bio threat agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you will hear in the interview,
Pam and Cindy met at Can Med 2019,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a great example of how attending
a Can Med event can lead to important
[SPEAKER_00]: professional partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the work Pam and Cindy
have done to understand how cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: affects human microbiomes, specifically
the vaginal microbiome and what that means
[SPEAKER_00]: for women's health products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other topics we discuss include why a
healthy reproductive microbiome is
[SPEAKER_00]: important for women's health, the
antimicrobial activity of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lack of safety testing around women's
health products, how cannabinoids affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the gut microbiome, and how bacteria
communicate with the human body and affect
[SPEAKER_00]: mental health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with Pam
and Cindy, I'd like to thank this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's sponsor, Medicine Women Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine Women's team of specialists
includes doctors, naturopaths,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis experts, nutritionists,
and alternative health practitioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: These integrative teams evaluate health
issues and design targeted protocols to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote personal healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine Women's protocols have
successfully alleviated symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, autoimmune disease, and
neurological conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as providing overall health
rejuvenation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at medicinewomenhealth.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Pam Miles and Cindy
[SPEAKER_00]: Orser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cindy and Pam, welcome and thank you for
joining me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're talking about microbiomes
because if you didn't know, the typical
[SPEAKER_00]: human body is home to approximately 40
trillion microbial cells, which is roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same amount of human cells in the
typical body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of these microorganisms are
essential to human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be maintained with proper diet
hygiene and lifestyle habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question that we're going to
explore today is how does cannabis affect
[SPEAKER_00]: our body's microbiomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, Cindy and Pam, why don't you
tell the listeners a little about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourselves and how you got interested in
researching how cannabis affects the human
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cindy, we'll have you start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I've been involved in the
cannabis industry for the past nine years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've built out two cannabis testing
facilities, one in Las Vegas Digipath Labs
[SPEAKER_03]: and one in San Diego Clip Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And during that time, I became aware that
some of the contaminants that are inherent
[SPEAKER_03]: in growing cannabis, mainly pesticides
that a lot of them are endocrine
[SPEAKER_03]: disruptors, could potentially be a problem
for certain segments of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was already on my mind about,
you know, there's so little we know about
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant and yet it's so widely used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And THC and CBD are, you know,
I consider them to be drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I meet Pam, whose interest is
more not on the inherent contaminants in
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis, but how those drugs,
the cannabinoids impact the microorganisms
[SPEAKER_03]: that are part of the human microbiome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that got me thinking in a totally
different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Pam and I have joined forces and I'll
let Pam talk about her company,
[SPEAKER_03]: Apothecare, and what we're hoping to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Cindy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ben, this is really exciting for me to
be here because I'm going to tell you that
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time I was introduced to Cindy
was at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Cindy was on a panel at CanMed and I
heard her talk about it was then it was
[SPEAKER_01]: the vaping crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was talking about the work that
she was doing at Digipath and how her lab
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to take a look at some of these
cartridges and analyze what was in them
[SPEAKER_01]: because they also had an R&D arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that started my
thinking process because I was looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody to be able to test the cannabis
products that I was actually making in my
[SPEAKER_01]: kitchen for the effect on the human
microbiome, specifically the vaginal
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rewinding back a little bit further to
another CanMed guest that you have had,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Brianna Cassidy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Brianna was the first person that I
talked to about looking at how cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: affects the vaginal microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are really interested in how cannabis
at Apothecare can remediate pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: pelvic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started making these suppositories
in my kitchen and passing them out to my
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors, my friends, and my family
members.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wasn't sure if they were actually
safe for use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little bit of a researcher by
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering, well, what is the
effect that these are having on the body?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I knew the folklore that they were
effective, but were there any residual
[SPEAKER_01]: downstream effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there wasn't anything in the published
medical literature or scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: literature to say what effects these had
on the human body when they were vaginally
[SPEAKER_01]: administered, like what were the
circulating cannabinoids or did they
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the microbiomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, we started to look for
somebody who could help us in a lab to
[SPEAKER_01]: determine if we found these microbes could
we take the cannabis, put that on the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbials and see what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I listened to Cindy at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point CanMed was, they were
focusing on the vaping crisis and Cindy
[SPEAKER_01]: was on a panel and she was talking about
how her lab was able to take a look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridges and what was in the vape
cartridges because they had an R&D
[SPEAKER_01]: component to her lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, hey, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went back to Massachusetts where I
spoke with Dr. Brianna Cassidy who was at
[SPEAKER_01]: a Massachusetts lab and we designed a
pilot study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then unfortunately, Dr. Cassidy left
the cannabis industry and went to Ginkgo
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioworks, but she had written some papers
with Dr. Orser and together we approached
[SPEAKER_01]: her and asked Cindy if she would take up
the mantle and proceed with the microbiome
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we got to where we are
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love to hear about cannabis and
the environment connections because we
[SPEAKER_00]: always talk about how it's a great place
to go and learn from other people in
[SPEAKER_00]: different sectors of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always like to hear firsthand that we
were able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you did this pilot study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you testing and what did you
find?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to let Cindy kind of lead
in the science direction here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I asked her to take a look at
how products that were already on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market and then some CBD and THC and how
they affected the four, which Cindy is now
[SPEAKER_01]: referring to as the sentinel bacteria of
the vaginal microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to let her talk to you about
what she first found and then how we
[SPEAKER_01]: morphed to something new after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the beginning, because this was kind
of trailblazing work, we just established
[SPEAKER_03]: a very simple exposure study using the
four prominent lactobacilli species that
[SPEAKER_03]: are found in the vaginal reproductive
tract and looking and exposing them to
[SPEAKER_03]: various intimate care products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call them legacy products.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been on the market for decades,
as well as this whole new swath of
[SPEAKER_03]: products that are coming out seemingly on
a monthly basis that contain CBD or CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: plus THC and some of the lesser
cannabinoids as well, because some
[SPEAKER_03]: companies are using broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were just curious because there had
been many reports of antimicrobial
[SPEAKER_03]: activity by cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were just curious whether or not
the inclusion of the cannabinoids in these
[SPEAKER_03]: products was impacting the population of
these healthy lactobacilli species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we found so far is that,
in fact, the cannabinoids are not
[SPEAKER_03]: impacting the lactobacilli species.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's obviously something in the
ingredients of some of these products that
[SPEAKER_03]: are detrimental and completely wipe out
the lactobacilli.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the consequence of that is really
shockingly detrimental to women's health.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult to reestablish these
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're not there maintaining this low
pH and populating the epithelial lining of
[SPEAKER_03]: the vagina, that allows other more
deleterious bacteria and viruses and
[SPEAKER_03]: fungi, candida, yeast to become
established in that epithelial tissue with
[SPEAKER_03]: dire consequences from bacterial
vaginosis, yeast infections, and both of
[SPEAKER_03]: which turn out to be fairly chronic and
reoccurring for women.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also it leads to inflammation of the
tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you are probably aware that in many
cancer models, inflammation is a first
[SPEAKER_03]: step down that path.
[SPEAKER_03]: But surprisingly also disruption of this
normal biotic environment leads to
[SPEAKER_03]: infertility, poor outcomes in pregnancy,
endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we believe that this isn't really a big
issue that should be brought to the
[SPEAKER_03]: attention of the consumer of these types
of products, but not at the expense of
[SPEAKER_03]: putting a negative light on use of
cannabinoids for, say, pelvic pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we feel like we've exposed a big area
that is obviously under researched and
[SPEAKER_03]: ignored as women's health has fallen into
that category for some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from our original simple screen of
exposing under anaerobic conditions,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've gone on to develop a molecular
assay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We partnered with a company I've worked
for before in Nebraska called Matt McCorr
[SPEAKER_03]: to develop our platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we have that for lactobacilli
species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're moving on to having developed it
for candida.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we hope to add other pathogenic
bacteria and eventually look at viruses as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to circle back, if I heard you
correctly, did you find that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids themselves were not
disrupting the good bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's some other component of these
products?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you know what that is yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is correct to date.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really want to make a caveat here
that, as you know, there are many,
[SPEAKER_03]: many different formats that cannabinoid
extracts come in and we have not tested
[SPEAKER_03]: broadly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've looked at a couple of different
isolates.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've looked at CBD and THC individually.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had the bandwidth yet to drill
down and look at some of the other minor
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are looking at CBG right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would like to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you also are aware, dosing is an
issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we feel like we have to go back and do
some more expanded dosing studies to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure we haven't missed something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to date, our conclusion would be that
it is not the cannabinoids that are the
[SPEAKER_03]: culprits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are looking at some of the other
specific ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to even mention even
another can med connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hemp mine, Dr. Allison Justice,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually are working with her and
sourcing some of our material from the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp mine, because it's also important to
us that we are looking at the products and
[SPEAKER_01]: we know the source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's anything that comes up in
our study, we can go directly to the
[SPEAKER_01]: grower and say, so what do you think might
be here that we're missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're talking about using broad
spectrum products, as we know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a number of different cannabinoids
in various different concentrations and
[SPEAKER_00]: some very minor cannabinoids and small
concentrations that we don't even really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a bit of a Gordian knot that
you need to unravel.
[SPEAKER_00]: To figure out what exactly is going on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so are you also looking at microbial
testing regulations around some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: vaginally administered products?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, for example, that there are a few
states that have specific testing
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements around that, Colorado being
one, as well as Oklahoma and Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your opinion, are those sufficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you sort of recommend other testing
requirements around that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, actually, I would recommend other
testing requirements, because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: Cindy would agree with me that those
requirements are looking at what's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at how the compounds,
the ingredients interact with the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we like to say that our testing is
dynamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that testing is they're looking in a
different way at something that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to see what the action is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I absolutely would say that if we could
do this, a very small organization that we
[SPEAKER_01]: are, some of these larger organizations
certainly could be testing their products
[SPEAKER_01]: for safety on all kinds of microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke this morning with a woman who's
very concerned about the urogenital
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome, and she suffered not cannabis
related, but she's been suffering from
[SPEAKER_01]: UTIs for over two years that are basically
one antibiotic after another, after
[SPEAKER_01]: another, after another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when people say that these
products, that lubricants or sexual serums
[SPEAKER_01]: is what we hear a lot, are topical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't need to be regulated because
they're designed or washes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're designed to come in contact with
the body, but then wash off.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not enough science to actually
show what the outcome is when you use
[SPEAKER_01]: these products on a continued basis or
what the duration is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we'd love to have all kinds of
funds to be able to do these time studies
[SPEAKER_01]: in our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're doing right now is what we
can accomplish with the resources that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think we're just at the beginning
of looking at how topically or internally
[SPEAKER_01]: applied products affect the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the problems of the
reproductive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so just to clarify again,
so your concern isn't so much about
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial contamination on these products
affecting the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the active components themselves in
the cannabis, the cannabinoids that still
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be better understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and it's not just the cannabinoids,
it's the formulation, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because these products come in various
formats from lubricants, suppositories,
[SPEAKER_03]: pain relieving, salves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's really no requirement for
revealing what the ingredients are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is totally unregulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of these products are considered
cosmetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even the ones without cannabinoids,
there's no regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do any safety testing to
get them on this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say, Ben, that I think it
needs to be both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, certainly we're concerned about
something that is already contaminated
[SPEAKER_01]: with a microbial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to add something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, that's part of where in this
industry, in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are kind of two lanes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a pharma lane and then there's the
adult use lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's spaces for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that when we're talking about
the reproductive system, we want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that everything's using good GMP
practices and that the products not only
[SPEAKER_01]: are safe because they've been studied for
their impact on the body, but they're also
[SPEAKER_01]: safe because we know that they don't
contain something that is going to impact
[SPEAKER_01]: the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it sort of all just comes back
to this this kind of idea that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't just for smoking anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's any number of different
ways that you can consume cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: products that are being infused with
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we don't fully understand
how they're going to affect these
[SPEAKER_00]: different systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the endocannabinoid system itself
is so complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't even fully understand how it
operates independently of the addition of
[SPEAKER_03]: phyto cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: It certainly overlaps and cooperates with
a lot of other self signaling systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult to sort it out at an
individual tissue or organ level.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, there are many studies,
most of them on the gut microbiome,
[SPEAKER_03]: showing that if you have changes or
disruption leading to dysbiosis,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether through taking antibiotics or
probiotics, that it leads to behavioral
[SPEAKER_03]: dysregulation that affects emotions,
anxiety and stress, as well as
[SPEAKER_03]: pathological conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's a trifecta.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very complex and it's very naive for
us to believe that we're not impacting how
[SPEAKER_03]: that homeostasis is maintained in the body
when we're stripping out these sentinel
[SPEAKER_03]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you brought up the gut
because I understand that the two of you
[SPEAKER_00]: are also researching how cannabinoids
affect the gut microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what do we know so far and what
is it that you guys are looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still, you know, working on the
reproductive tract microbiome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for many reasons, it's it was
how apothecare was started.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But clearly, the most studies have been
published on the consequence of disruption
[SPEAKER_03]: of the microbiota in the gut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's established the the gut brain
axis of the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most most of the convincing data comes
from pathological states.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a recent article that was very
informative on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really the study studies have
been going on for a couple of decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what's new is throwing in what is
the effect of the and in the animal model,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're usually animal models if if
they're consuming THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and certainly THC has an effect in
studies that have been done in rodents
[SPEAKER_03]: where they're fed THC with or without a
high fat diet that the microbiota ratios
[SPEAKER_03]: change in terms of speciation and also the
mice lose weight, which is extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: appealing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not completely clear what all is
happening at the receptor level.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at CBD, because CBD has this
reputation as alleviating anxiety and
[SPEAKER_03]: inflammation, those studies are not as
clear cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are also differences in abundance of
certain microorganisms when the animal is
[SPEAKER_03]: fed CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's harder to make that connection
with a behavioral change if you're looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those studies are ongoing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just extremely complex to carry
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're hard to do, as you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, research in this area,
one of the reasons that Apothecare looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at commercial labs to do our work is
because using university or institutional
[SPEAKER_01]: institutions like that, you know,
if they're federally funded, it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know the hurdles that people have
been facing with doing research with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this seemed to us like the most
effective and expedious way of doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: research is to go to a commercial lab that
already had the capabilities to do R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why we chose that path at
Apothecare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and it's I think it's important to
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, we know that cannabinoids,
they have this antimicrobial activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think a lot of people,
myself included, think like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antimicrobial, you don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you think about, you know,
the microbiota and how we need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial microbes in our own bodies to
help carry out these processes might not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily be a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we definitely need a lot more
studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, because now we know that certain
species in the gut actually are making
[SPEAKER_03]: their own signaling molecules that then
have a consequence on what's happening in
[SPEAKER_03]: the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is a recent study,
a peptide derivative, isoameline or
[SPEAKER_03]: something made by a gut bacteria that they
believe plays a role in memory retention
[SPEAKER_03]: in the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the case of the vaginal
microbiome, I keep telling Pam that at
[SPEAKER_03]: some point we need to start looking at
hormone levels and how the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: impact that because it is in the
literature that the ECS system interplays
[SPEAKER_03]: with estrogen, which also has a very
complex regulatory role and not only in
[SPEAKER_03]: reproduction, but also in brain
development.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not limited to just females,
it's also males.
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, estradiol plays a role in
the expression of FAAH, which is the key
[SPEAKER_03]: enzyme that modulates the endocannabinoid
tone in the body.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a primary actor in driving
endocannabinoid signaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we don't really know how
chronic exposure to THC or CBD affects
[SPEAKER_03]: this interesting intricate play between
estrogen and the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the things that we really
started to try to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to working with Cindy, I had been in
contact with some researchers in Canada to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at how, if we introduce products
vaginally, again, what the circulating
[SPEAKER_01]: blood levels would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we couldn't get those studies approved
because it would be one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wanted to see more evidence that
the products weren't harmful to begin
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we kind of started to do
this like maybe micro research,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could say, as we're looking at the
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because we can now say that the THC
isolate and CBD isolate, we're pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: confident that those do not affect the
healthy microbiota in the four bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are looking at, that that then
gives us a lead to do these deeper studies
[SPEAKER_01]: and to maybe get funding from larger
institutions like the NIH that are very
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I do think, and I think many of us
that have been on the adult use side of
[SPEAKER_01]: this believe that cannabis and
cannabinoids can have a very positive
[SPEAKER_01]: effect on the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just want to make sure we explore
and are knowing consumers of what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so winding down here, because I see
that our timer is counting down at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys can see that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I let you go, I want to give you
both a chance to tell the listeners about
[SPEAKER_00]: any additional resources that they can
look at to learn more about this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to put them in the show
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then additionally, if there's a way
that they can connect with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can make some more can med connections,
whether it's through social media or
[SPEAKER_00]: websites or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please plug away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pam, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the social.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go to apothecare.com,
which is our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a chart up there of some of the
some of the things that we have tested
[SPEAKER_01]: recently, and those contain both cannabis
and non-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we don't list any products there
because we are looking at the type of
[SPEAKER_01]: products that we're using right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually we will start to list
and name products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now we're just looking at the
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumer beware is what we're saying is be
be aware of what you're what you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are on Instagram at Apothecare and also
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this work is nascent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in the beginning phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we'd like to do is just raise
awareness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want people to kind of demand that
their products are tested for those that
[SPEAKER_01]: contain cannabis and those that aren't if
they're using them for intimate care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I would say is my my big
shout out is just to raise awareness,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, start asking questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big consumer advocacy component
to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would love to get the FDA's attention
and require testing of these products
[SPEAKER_03]: before they end up on the shelf to show
whether or not they're stripping out these
[SPEAKER_03]: and elective bacilli species.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd also like to plug that apothecare is
in the fam tech hub incubator round
[SPEAKER_03]: currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are actively fundraising.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be at the Women's Innovation
Forum, which is at the end of this month.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we hope to see Can Med include a panel
discussion on this very timely topic in
[SPEAKER_03]: their March twenty twenty three symposium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would like to see that as well and
hopefully that we can make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we'd love to have you you
on there leading that in participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and then for Massachusetts,
Florida looks really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm up in Massachusetts as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Florida and May, you can't put
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, Cindy and Pam, thanks again for
joining me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, with that in mind, I look forward
to seeing you down in Marco Island next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
