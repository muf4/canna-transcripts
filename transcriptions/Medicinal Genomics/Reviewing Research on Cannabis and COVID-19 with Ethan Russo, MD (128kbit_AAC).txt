[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you believe we are only three months
away from CanMed 2022?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, for one, cannot wait for CanMed 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you consider it's been 28 months
since our last event, I guess three months
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't that long to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean you should wait to
buy your ticket to the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head over to CanMedEvents.com now and get
your tickets today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three full days of world-class
cannabis educational content scheduled for
[SPEAKER_00]: May 3rd through 5th at the Pasadena
Convention Center in Pasadena,
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all starts on May 3rd with our full-day
medical practicum, led by Dr. Bonnie
[SPEAKER_00]: Goldstein, Dr. Dustin Sulak, Dr. Kevin
Spellman, and Eloise Thiessen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of them will share the latest medical
cannabis research, including information
[SPEAKER_00]: on dosing, drug interactions, and
different product types.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will also share their clinical
experience they have acquired treating
[SPEAKER_00]: patients with medical cannabis over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a must-attend event for any
healthcare professionals who are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in recommending medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not limited to those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who is interested in learning about
medical cannabis can and should join us
[SPEAKER_00]: for this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head over to CanMedEvents.com slash
practicum to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: As wonderful as that practicum is,
it's just the appetizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: May 4th and 5th is the main course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two full days of oral presentations,
panel discussions, poster presentations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and industry exhibitors covering the
latest advances in cannabis science,
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, cultivation, and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are really excited about this year's
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be our best yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at our keynote presenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Dr. Ethan Russo presenting
cannabis and psychiatry, Dr. Seth Crawford
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about innovations in hemp
breeding, Grace Bandong will talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: building a comprehensive analytical
testing program, and Dr. Bonnie Goldstein
[SPEAKER_00]: will discuss cannabis medicine for
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those presentations alone are worth the
price of admission, but please go to
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMedEvents.com to see the full schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want a preview of what you can
expect at CanMed 2022, check out our
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed archive, which is a searchable
video library of all the past CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: presentations and panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that at CanMedEvents.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which brings us to this episode's guest,
Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you just heard, Ethan is a CanMed 2022
keynote presenter, and Ethan is no
[SPEAKER_00]: stranger to CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an attendee at our early events at
Harvard Medical School, as well as a
[SPEAKER_00]: presenter at CanMed 2018 at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is one of the most experienced cannabis
researchers in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan is a board certified neurologist,
a psychopharmacology researcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: an author, a lecturer, a consultant,
the man does it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, he joins us to talk about the
research that has been done to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: whether cannabis can be used to treat
COVID-19 and or prevent infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: More specifically, we discuss what role
the endocannabinoid system plays in
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing and clearing a viral infection,
the different levels of clinical research,
[SPEAKER_00]: the importance of peer review,
and we also talk about some specific
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most notably, the University of Chicago
study that claims CBD inhibits SARS-CoV-2
[SPEAKER_00]: replication, the Oregon University study
that claims cannabinoid acids can prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID infection, animal models showing CBD
can calm the cytokine storm, a preprint
[SPEAKER_00]: study claiming CBD primes the innate
immune system, and we also look at claims
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis smokers have a greater risk
of COVID-19 infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Ethan, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Founded in 2010, Project CBD is the first
and longest running website dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: research and education on the benefits of
CBD, and it's the premier destination for
[SPEAKER_00]: both curious and committed CBD consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often the first to report on cutting edge
health issues, Project CBD's reporting
[SPEAKER_00]: reflects a deeper understanding of
developments in cannabinoid science and
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at ProjectCBD.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So throughout the pandemic, we've seen
headlines about cannabis as a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment for COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as is the case with most things these
days, it's hard to know what's real and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's being sensationalized for clicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, thank you for coming on to be a
trusted expert that can help us find the
[SPEAKER_00]: signal and all the noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll try.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this by saying that there's a big
difference between the way I would like
[SPEAKER_01]: things and the way that I think that they
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's issue that caveat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where I remind people that my
training is as a neurologist, not a
[SPEAKER_01]: virologist, but hopefully we can translate
some of the scientific jargon into things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it's best to start broadly and
then we can kind of get into discussing
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these specific studies and see
which ones have the most promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, given what we know about
cannabinoids, and the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system, is there potential for cannabis
medicine to be helpful in the fight
[SPEAKER_00]: against COVID-19?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is always more than one
consideration here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First would be, are there medicines that
help prevent infection or kill the virus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in the case of COVID, are there things
that help with the aftermath or preventing
[SPEAKER_01]: further damage?
[SPEAKER_01]: People are probably familiar at this point
with the idea of the cytokine storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This may have less to do with the virus
itself than it does with the body's
[SPEAKER_01]: overreaction to its presence, such that
it's attacking its own tissues,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these are branch points where
any medical intervention might help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question then becomes,
could cannabis or components help here,
[SPEAKER_01]: here, or here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these things need to be
considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing to consider,
at least when we're kind of looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: research that's being put out,
is sort of the different levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was hoping you could kind of help
explain that, again, to kind of set the
[SPEAKER_00]: table, because from what I can gather,
a lot of the work that's being done on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and COVID is very preliminary,
which means that the results that are seen
[SPEAKER_00]: there might not hold up when we start
working with actual patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, the first step is looking at
things in the lab, maybe at cells and
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they do things like use HEK
cells, which stands for human embryonic
[SPEAKER_01]: kidney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are used because they're easy to
hook on cell receptors to, so that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: test the hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's a long way from that to
saying that something's going to work in
[SPEAKER_01]: the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next echelon up is animal studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, do these translate well?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we'll see, sometimes they're
injecting very large doses into a rodent,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's not the same as what can be
achieved in a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third, and most important, would be human
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically these go through three
phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase one is only possible after you've
established to the satisfaction of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Food and Drug Administration that the
compound you're testing is safe and not
[SPEAKER_01]: toxic to a degree that is going to be
dangerous by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that steps past, phase one means
that you test your drug in normal
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or normal participants to see what its
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fancy way of saying how much gets
into the blood and what kind of reactions
[SPEAKER_01]: do people get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then phase two, you're actually studying
the disease process and how people are
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are called safety and efficacy
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the way, you also have to go through
chemistry manufacturing and control to
[SPEAKER_01]: show that your study drug is consistent
over time and is made to what are called
[SPEAKER_01]: good manufacturing practice standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, phase three is in large numbers
of people, again, looking at safety and
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pass all that, you get FDA
approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a process that often takes 10
to 12 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And upwards of a billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with a neutral product, there's a
possibility of it doing it in less time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Case in point would be Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there again, we were dealing with
decades of information regarding the
[SPEAKER_01]: relative safety of cannabidiol in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then getting it through clinical
trials for a very important set of
[SPEAKER_01]: disorders where basically conventional
medicine has fallen short.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was also under what's called an
orphan designation, meaning that less than
[SPEAKER_01]: 250,000 people in the US were affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a shortcut.
[SPEAKER_01]: With COVID, you wouldn't necessarily have
that shortcut, but you may have other
[SPEAKER_01]: shortcuts because of the severity and wide
reach of the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that's a long-winded answer to a
short question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least from what I gather in the
studies that I sort of put together for
[SPEAKER_00]: this conversation, I didn't see anything
getting beyond animal models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was on the Nuyan study that I just
read yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called cannabidiol inhibits
SARS-CoV-2 replication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through induction of the host ER stress
and in-eat immune responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did look at humans, but in a very
indirect way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could go into that detail if you like
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they did, and this is a little bit
hazy because in the methodology section,
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't go into this in a lot of
detail, but purportedly they looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: people who were on a high potency
cannabidiol preparation, which I assume
[SPEAKER_01]: was Epidiolex, because they described it,
and it's the only one I know of,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically 100 milligrams CBD per
milliliter in patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this must be Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they looked at the incidence of
SARS-CoV-2 in patients on that preparation
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to patients who were not on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And supposedly they were comparable in
demographics, but there weren't a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: detail there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why is this important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first, who gets Epidiolex?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is approved in three groups of
patients, those with Dravet syndrome,
[SPEAKER_01]: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and seizure
disorders associated with tuberous
[SPEAKER_01]: sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all generally children,
sometimes adults, with extremely severe
[SPEAKER_01]: seizure disorder syndromes and
developmental delays.
[SPEAKER_01]: One would have to think that in the era of
COVID, that these are patients that are
[SPEAKER_01]: really being sequestered by their family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not gonna be out and about,
and they're not gonna be eating in
[SPEAKER_01]: restaurants unmasked or this kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was there a benefit to them being on
this high potency cannabidiol preparation,
[SPEAKER_01]: or was it more that they've been isolated
and were getting less infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something you cannot answer
from the available evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there were statistically significant
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's intriguing, but it is very
preliminary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's true, but let's keep this in
context.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's suppose it is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concentration is very high,
and the doses required would be very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extrapolating from the studies they did in
rodents, this could be anywhere from 113
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of cannabidiol a day up to 450
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the patients where they're actually
describing use and reduce COVID incidence,
[SPEAKER_01]: generally the dosing on that is 15
milligrams per kilogram per day of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in an adult, this is gonna be upwards
of 1500 milligrams or 2000 milligrams a
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, even if available, is gonna be
prohibitively expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The projected average cost per patient of
Epidiolex in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is $32,500 a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're talking about something
that's given as a preventive, not as a
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment at the time, that's an enormous
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you could not bear across the large
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that would absolutely bankrupt the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have enough drugs that are bankrupting
the system right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, interesting is what I'd say.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer, absolutely not, and not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need a lot more work to see if
there's something there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hope it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we have to throw some cold
water on this as being anything more than
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit intriguing at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was looking at it using CBD as
a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: There would be a role for treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed that cannabidiol at least in
the animals could decrease replication and
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibit viral gene expression,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, this may be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I hope it's the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the animal studies they did also were
done by doing intraperitoneal injections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, they lift the skin of
the abdomen and inject this and it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: around the gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a highly vascular system and it
absorbs relatively well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big difference between that and
saying that an oral dose in humans is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be absorbed to a sufficient
degree to come anywhere near close to the
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue concentrations that were achieved
in the animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, in one of the other studies,
one that's been outlongering and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten a lot more play.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Van Bremen study about
cannabinoids blocking entry of SARS-CoV-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that one out of Oregon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cannabidiolic acid, CBDA,
and CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here, the problem is an even greater
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, again, this is a very
interesting study.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was good science involved,
but I fault this one, the way it was
[SPEAKER_01]: reported, I fault that to lack of adequate
peer review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be published in a peer-reviewed
journal, it means it's got to go through a
[SPEAKER_01]: panel of experts who critique the article
and suggest changes or corrections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that fell down somewhere
along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, with CBGA, cannabidiolic
acid, they described an inhibitory
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of 35 micrograms per
milliliter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the problem is that's not the way that
we usually report things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done in what's termed a tissue
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now converting that, we get a calculation
of 97 to 102 micromolar for CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Micromolar means millions of a mole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mole is the molecular weight in grams per
liter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this means is that a tremendous
concentration is needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, anything above 10 micromolars
is considered non-druggable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-druggable is a term of the industry,
meaning whether you can turn it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people who have experience in this
area will tell you that I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: totally impractical that you could create
these kinds of tissue concentrations by
[SPEAKER_01]: giving this orally to someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true that the cannabinoid acids have
sometimes been shown to have a greater
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailability, ability to get absorbed
and into the body than the neutral
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think this is achievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's possible you could do this on
a surface, like spraying it on the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to prepare, you can spray 70% ethanol
or rubbing alcohol in that concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: on the virus and you'll kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's what's called an envelope
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you knock out the envelope,
the virus can't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has led to the kind of misconceptions
like with President Trump at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: recommending people ingest bleach to kill
the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, not quite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not understand the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the article, and this is again where
I fault what I think is a lack of peer
[SPEAKER_01]: review, they felt that these kinds of
concentrations would be clinically
[SPEAKER_01]: achievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dissent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and again, I've talked to many of my
colleagues about this and we're in
[SPEAKER_01]: agreement that this is just not practical
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not even the fact that it would be
cost prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that it's just not achievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, not what I'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love for this to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there could be an ace in the hole
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a good response with both CBDA
and CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens with the two of them
together?
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't test that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there were some kind of synergy,
a boosting of effect of the two together,
[SPEAKER_01]: which often we see with botanical
mixtures, maybe they could get it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: range where it's more meaningful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, it's not even close.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, numbers that high,
you just don't see in a drug that goes to
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so we know that cannabinoids are or
phytocannabinoids are plant compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: mimic our endocannabinoids that our body
makes ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there some takeaway here or some
application here where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something to boost our our own
endocannabinoid production that can help,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, prevent an infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's take a little bit of leap of
faith here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that there's some signal here
that indicates that cannabidiol can
[SPEAKER_01]: influence the cytokine storms and could
reduce damage associated with the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that that's really
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I don't think that that's been
demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would require clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that overall the
endocannabinoid system is a homeostatic
[SPEAKER_01]: regulator or physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, it keeps things in
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a system is overactive, it brings it
down into the normal range.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's underactive, it brings it up into
the normal range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of this has to do with protective
influences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that CBD does is
inhibit the breakdown of anandamide,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, cannabidiol may well
increase the gain of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system and offer protective effects,
particularly against these sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: immunological battles that people go
through after a severe COVID infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's a maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the last thing I would want is
to say that none of this has any
[SPEAKER_01]: application or future viability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that a lot more research
needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would point out that, yeah,
it's really possible that compounds from
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or other natural products are
going to turn out to be part of the answer
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is all too soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know sort of just talking about
cannabis as as regulating your body's
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things is that depending on
the patient's situation, that cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: be an immune booster or it can be an
immune reducer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the preprint studies that came
out just this month was talking about CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: being used to potentially prime components
of the innate immune system, increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: readiness to respond to viral infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there some potential there as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'd say this about preprints.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I'm a Ginnit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in the past, you had to submit
your article for review in a journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went through peer review and then
hopefully was published.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there has developed this tendency to
put things online and they get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: press coverage before they've been through
peer review at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they never even make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it is a situation that is
fraught with pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, an earlier study in relation to
CBD and SARS-CoV-2 was a Kovalchuk study.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the idea that CBD was going to
interfere with binding to the spike
[SPEAKER_01]: protein of COVID that where it binds to
the ACE-2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with that study was that they
looked at different cannabis extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: different levels of CBD, and there was no
dose response effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, some work better than
others, but it really didn't relate to the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, again, there might be
something there, but it equally could be
[SPEAKER_01]: the case that it was another component of
the extracts that was really responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, really, it is absolutely
essential that people look at this very
[SPEAKER_01]: skeptically with a proverbial jaundiced
eye to try and find out what the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: line truth of the matter is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great point you make about
preprints, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, as you said, they haven't gone
through peer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't gone to the same scrutiny as
something that's published in a true
[SPEAKER_00]: journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a good thing to keep in
mind as people are looking into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've taken a stand that I wouldn't
do preprints on research that we've done,
[SPEAKER_01]: even when we think it's really exciting
and we'd like to get the word out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the internet age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, what I really don't like is
that these things get publicized and
[SPEAKER_01]: misinterpreted because of this exposure
without the proper degree of initial
[SPEAKER_01]: scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a double edged sword, though,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this being an ongoing pandemic and
there's really a need for information so
[SPEAKER_00]: that people can act appropriately,
that waiting to go through the full peer
[SPEAKER_00]: review process might not be prudent
always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it is our best defense against
junk science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a difficult spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we're sort of getting to the end
here, I did want to sort of bring up the
[SPEAKER_00]: question of is there a potential that
cannabis use could actually be detrimental
[SPEAKER_00]: to someone's experience with COVID?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could actually, you know, as we said,
cannabis can regulate your immune system
[SPEAKER_00]: in either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be that cannabis could actually
reduce your immune response and make you
[SPEAKER_00]: more vulnerable to COVID infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the main danger would relate to
smoking and the damage to the lung tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is simply inarguable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue of whether smoking is good for
the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true that smoking cannabis does not
lead to lung cancer epidemiologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it is absolutely clear that it
does lead to irritation, cough and phlegm,
[SPEAKER_01]: greater susceptibility to upper
respiratory infections, and perhaps even a
[SPEAKER_01]: greater susceptibility to COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this would not relate to
immunological damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dosing of THC, for example,
that is immunosuppressant is very high,
[SPEAKER_01]: previously estimated at 50 to 100 times
the psychoactive dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, various cannabis components can
be immunomodulatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, CB2 activity may be
helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's again, it depends on what's
in it and how it's administered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking, not good for the lungs and
certainly would be something to avoid at
[SPEAKER_01]: this juncture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less of an issue with vaporization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, oral administration is going to
be safer with any kind of lung issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, on the one hand, yeah, people should
avoid smoking in general, anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, it's unlikely that use of
cannabis-based medicines is going to cause
[SPEAKER_01]: harm in this instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger question is, can it help in any
respect?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer right now is maybe,
but it's got to be proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when you mentioned that the
amount of THC to kind of be
[SPEAKER_00]: immunosuppressive is really high,
it seems like this is sort of a common
[SPEAKER_00]: refrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout the conversation here is
that the dose is really what might be the
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting factor here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we covered most of the studies
that I had pulled out for us to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that you had that we
missed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I mean, I would just advise
people to, you know, if you read something
[SPEAKER_01]: about one of these studies and aren't
sure, try to talk to somebody that might
[SPEAKER_01]: be a little more familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be skeptical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good advice would be wait until higher
authorities say what seems to be helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: and what's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a moving target.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a situation now with some of the
antibody treatments that used to help
[SPEAKER_01]: don't work on Omicron.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's one left that does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's some oral agents that
work, you know, keep up with what the CDC
[SPEAKER_01]: and FDA might be saying now, not what they
were saying three months ago, because
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is in a state of flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny you said that about the
monoclonal antibodies, because that just
[SPEAKER_00]: the alert just came up on my phone before
I came in here to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's ever changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Ethan, well, thanks again for
coming on and talking with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put links to all these
studies in the notes so people can read up
[SPEAKER_00]: on it is, I guess, one final thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to share any websites or
social media or ways people can keep up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the work that you're doing,
please plug away.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, you know, our company is Credo
Science and that's Credo C-R-E-D-O dash
[SPEAKER_01]: science dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see what we're up to there on the
news front.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just last week released a diagnostic
screening test for cannabinoid hyperemesis
[SPEAKER_01]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Information on that can be found on what
is CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what dash is dash CHS dot com on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of useful information and
links there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had Alice Moon on the podcast
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about cannabinoid hyperemesis
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great that we're we're getting to
a point where we can start determining
[SPEAKER_00]: what's what's causing that, because it
seems to be quite the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we think we have an answer in
genetic susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, we showed five genes that were
statistically significantly different in
[SPEAKER_01]: CHS patients as compared to patients who
used high amounts of cannabis but didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we believe that there are some
underlying susceptibilities and this is,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, worth exploring further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to seeing you out in
Pasadena for CanMed 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get there.
