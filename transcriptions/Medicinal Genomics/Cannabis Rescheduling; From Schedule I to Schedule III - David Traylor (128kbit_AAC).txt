[SPEAKER_01]: of a lot of people's minds as we move into
2024 is this whole idea of the possibility
[SPEAKER_01]: of the DEA rescheduling cannabis from a
schedule one drug to a schedule three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interested to get your thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think that's going to happen,
when maybe you think that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen and what does that really mean for
investment in the, in the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, first off to say,
I think most people agree out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no crystal ball for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a hard industry to predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, I was looking through
some old emails over the holiday then and
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled up some material that we'd been
asked to put together for an ICD3 event,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is many people in the know or not in
the know, but they've been around the
[SPEAKER_00]: block in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in New York in 20, October,
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Al Foreman was part of this piece of
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of us were asked to kind of
provide our predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Zuber, Vika Desai, a number of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we came out
with looking at is trying to predict in
[SPEAKER_00]: five years what the sector is going to
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the first things we started off
with was how many medical states are there
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did some simple math,
but we essentially said that they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be 40 states and in DC, they're legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly speaking, if you look back at
it right now, and that was October,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018, five years ago, we didn't hit the
nail on the head, frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, again, there's no crystal ball,
but the other thing that we like to do at
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Eagle Partners is we're very
quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I have a degree in biochemistry and
degree in molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I have three US patents to my
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very analytical and quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many of you may have seen the piece
that we put out on LinkedIn mid-December
[SPEAKER_00]: on trying to actually apply some of the
data that the DEA, we looked at how many
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds had been scheduled, rescheduled,
or descheduled in the last five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually, the answer was 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at applied,
when do those actually happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: What quarter of each calendar year from
2018 on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we applied that analysis to when
we might think what this might happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's hard to predict,
but come of our analysis, we thought
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a 10% chance that there won't even
be a schedule three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a schedule two, but then if
it's a schedule three, then when might
[SPEAKER_00]: that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I thought was there's probably a 25%
chance that if they rescheduled to
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule three, it might not even have
before the election.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means, and again, this is just
kind of applied some trying to sense to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everybody had agreed listening
to this, that there's not a 100% chance
[SPEAKER_00]: that the DEA is gonna reschedule this
before the election.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, the 75% chance,
we applied that to the data that we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when these events happen, when the DEA
analysis is in the federal register and
[SPEAKER_00]: our analysis came up with the best chances
in Q2 that it will be rescheduled,
[SPEAKER_00]: 41% chance that it will happen in Q2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've also heard people thinking that
the DEA is gonna announce a rescheduling
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis on April 20th, 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't imagine that the DEA is gonna
play to the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, one of the points we
don't think they're gonna play to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing that during the
Benzinga podcast with Hunter Land,
[SPEAKER_00]: our thought is it's probably not gonna
happen before the election.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the data points that not many
people saw is, I think it was December
[SPEAKER_00]: 12th, just less than a month ago,
the DEA announced adding another six
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds to schedule one, and these are
cannabis mimetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're not naturally occurring
cannabinoids, and they're not even
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, they're cannabis mimetics,
but they do hit the CB1, CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it's out of the realm of
imagination to assume that the DEA was
[SPEAKER_00]: thumbing their nose at the cannabis sector
by throwing these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially again, to be clear,
Ben, the DEA put these six compounds on a
[SPEAKER_00]: temporary preliminary schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a year, if their findings come
to fruition, they will then keep it on or
[SPEAKER_00]: take it off schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guess is though that most people don't
realize that there are 43 cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis mimetic cannabinoid associated
compounds on schedule one right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now let's add to the 43 to the six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's 49, 43 was the number
before December, and now there's 49.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's so screwed up about
this whole thing that we wanna make really
[SPEAKER_00]: important is that there's over 500
compounds that are scheduled by the DEA on
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one through five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of those, there's only one of those is
not a compound, that's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is not a compound, cannabis is a
plant, it's a genus, as we mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole thing about trying to apply
analysis and logic to what the DEA is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do this is really hard to do because
again, the whole logic behind this,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, if you're applying the biochemistry
perspective on this, cannabis is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: compound, it's a collection of 500 plus
compounds or more than that probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having them reschedule or
de-schedule cannabis as itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's ridiculous.
So that's it for this video.
Thanks for watching.
