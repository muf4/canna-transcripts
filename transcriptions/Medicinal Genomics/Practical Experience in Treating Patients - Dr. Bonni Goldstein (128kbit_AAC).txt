[SPEAKER_00]: A warm welcome here in Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into the medical cannabis field
because of a friend who was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is pediatric emergency
medicine, which I did for about 13 years
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Los Angeles area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Busy hours, working at night, taking care
of pretty sick kids in the inner city and
[SPEAKER_00]: East LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had a small child at home,
and I was burned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I took time off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, you know, we all say
things happen for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine contacted me who was sick
and said, I want to use medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was utterly ignorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the college days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, I had no experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to do my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I had time on my hands,
I was able to read a lot of the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I'll help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I decided to go back to
practice, I decided to transition into the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really haven't looked back since
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take care of both adults and children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of my pediatric background,
I, in the past three years, and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that too, because of Dr. Sanjay
Gupta's documentary, have had a,
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible surge of pediatric patients
seeking care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, California has the
reputation of the Wild West.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that without regulations
there, it is kind of hard to practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm gonna tell everybody is that
my patients are getting medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: My patients are getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: My patients have better quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the rest of the country,
it is imperative that we follow,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the rest of the country follows
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of things that we can do
better there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we're working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government's now stepped in a little
bit to help regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people in the industry are
starting to recognize that they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: self-regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard Dr. Mishulam say yesterday,
medical and recreational need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: separated absolutely 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both need to be available in every
state in this great country of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to lead the way for the rest of
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a plant that has some
incredible properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a country where we allow people to
drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, we have to look at
ourselves and say, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, I'll just move on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just decided to make a list of
diagnoses of the patients that I see in my
[SPEAKER_00]: adult patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just some of the more common
diagnoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it spans just about
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one day's time, I can see patients with
10 different organ systems involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, going back to the
endocannabinoid system being involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these illnesses, that's why it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even my own attorney says, oh,
you think it cures everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to look at where the
cannabinoid receptors are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will help lead you to understand
what's going on with these illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: With pediatrics, as you can see,
it's just a handful of diagnoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: By far, it's the patients that I see with
treatment-resistant epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing a lot more patients with
autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think John did an excellent talk
about how this is such a devastating
[SPEAKER_00]: disease for families.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really impacts the quality of life for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about siblings who are living with
this, who struggle to just go to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a sibling at home that they're
terrified of.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that definitely needs to
be addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advanced cancer in pediatrics,
which is heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've been seeing a fair amount of
patients with severe psychiatric disorders
[SPEAKER_00]: and also pandas, which I'll go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a few patients with that,
but I've had very good success in just
[SPEAKER_00]: that handful of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rationale for cannabis use in
pediatrics is that over the past decade or
[SPEAKER_00]: so, with thanks to many of the researchers
that are looking at endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: dysfunction, there is some scientific
evidence showing that these patients are
[SPEAKER_00]: having manifestation of endocannabinoid
dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If their endocannabinoid system is not
working, we are seeing illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with cannabis, if you look back
throughout time, going back even to the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-1800s, there are reports looking at
the safety of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one that British researchers
went to India to look at the safety,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a really interesting report from
1894.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's been multiple reports
after that of the safety profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, with children, I like medical
supervision, but there's no question that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in general is quite well
tolerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly safer than most of the
medications that we're prescribing to
[SPEAKER_00]: children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality of life, of course, is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a child who's ill and the
parents in the audience who have an ill
[SPEAKER_00]: child can tell you quality of life is
terribly impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to some of the cancer
patients or some of the patients with
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy who have terminal genetic
disease, just compassionate care and end
[SPEAKER_00]: of life importance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no question that that helps
people get through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, of course, since 2012,
we've been able to test the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have a ways to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly after Kevin's talk,
I've learned a lot more about testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have the ability to test so that
patients can be somewhat assured that the
[SPEAKER_00]: medication that they're getting is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, research is still
desperately needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of research coming out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that we're all here today looking
at this is absolutely inspiring to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met so many people who are interested
and intrigued by this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of us need to really go out there
and spread the word and lead the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did with my practice,
since I don't have a lot of time today,
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided just to kind of collect my data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I looked at my patients who came to
me with treatment resistant epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to be on at least three months of
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them were even on oil a year
or even two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a whole plant oil extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to get results from 201
patients that responded to my emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the age range was five months to 18
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people always ask me, how many
patients do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have over probably 300 plus pediatric
patients using cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have over 200 patients using cannabis
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 201 responded to the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So average number of anti-epileptic drugs
tried prior to coming to my office was 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a range of two drugs all the
way up to 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average number of drugs that they were
taking at the same time as they started
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD was three with a range of zero to
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 15 patients in this group who
were not taking any other drugs at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time that they started CBD,
which definitely in my experience makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: easier because of the drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I listed the common
comorbidities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these patients have a lot of
challenges, global delay, CP, autism,
[SPEAKER_00]: cortical visual impairment, feeding
difficulties, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just one thing necessarily
that we're looking at counting seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking at are these other
issues being improved by cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the strains and the CBD to THC
ratios varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte's Web is a fairly common
medicine for patients to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about a 27 to one CBD to THC
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then various preparations of ACDC,
which is available in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you that I've been doing
this eight years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started, nobody even talked
about CBD and really until about 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013 is when we started talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally because of the push of
families to get access to this medication
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past year and a half, it went from
one product available to now at least
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 10 or 12 products available for
people to try that are clean and tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, fairly so far,
fairly safe for my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I made a chart of the results
that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, some patients did have
worsening seizures and we like to
[SPEAKER_00]: attribute that to drug interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two of these eight kids actually were
not on any medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no question that some of these
patients do not do well with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: No response in this particular group was
six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do know that I have a higher number
than that that did not respond to my
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to say necessarily that's the
exact number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that it's a little bit higher
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is that I had about 28
patients that responded who reported that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no reduction in number of
seizures, but they had a reduction in the
[SPEAKER_00]: severity and the duration with cognitive
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them report that because the
seizures aren't so bad, we don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the hospital as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not using rescue medicine as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, again, is an improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, these are people who are
living with seizures sometimes in dozens
[SPEAKER_00]: of seizures a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some even have hundreds of seizures a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are now saying we're having some
improvement in the quality of life because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not in the hospital every four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the disruption to family life
when you're in the hospital all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because one of these,
one of my patients is actually doing quite
[SPEAKER_00]: well when the family came back for a
recheck just recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, just tell me negatives,
positive, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing the father said is I
don't have to take care of the kids
[SPEAKER_00]: because my wife is sitting in the hospital
with a sick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was huge to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the number one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have five kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very hard when one parent
disappears for a week to go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you can see, the range are 25
to 49%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is based on parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked them to keep a log, to keep a
calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are very good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's hard to keep track of
every seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we have to trust the
families to be able to give us a
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do find that the families when it
doesn't work, they share that with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a costly medicine in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's not working, I hear about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do feel that it's somewhat reliable
data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see of the 27 seizure-free
patients, remember these are children who
[SPEAKER_00]: were told there is nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have nothing to offer you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 27 families that now have a child
that's seizure-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight are actually pharmaceutical-free as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest are still weaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 40% of my patients have been able to
wean one or more medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's only five milligrams of a
drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's 50% of the medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weaning of drugs takes a long time for
many of these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, you can be seizure-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you start messing with some of
the AEDs, what happens is then you start
[SPEAKER_00]: having seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the families have actually
chosen just to stay right where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: at, leave the drugs on board, and let
their child outgrow the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they just feel that they're in a
good place and they're terrified to lose
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of negative side effects,
the only two really that popped up in this
[SPEAKER_00]: were drowsiness and diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course the drowsiness may come from if
we're using very high doses or also I find
[SPEAKER_00]: certain medications like clobazam and
others increase the sedative effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you look at the positive side
effects, this is where parents on the
[SPEAKER_00]: survey really just kind of went nuts
writing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: More alert, better mood, better sleep,
more energy, better response to therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, and I put in quotes,
able to argue one parent actually
[SPEAKER_00]: complained to me that their child wasn't
as compliant because he was less drugged
[SPEAKER_00]: up and more with the program and now he
cared if you put his shoes on and gave you
[SPEAKER_00]: a hard time about putting his shoes on
when they left the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, that's called a normal child and
parenting is part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No ER visits, less need for rescue
medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my families actually measure,
they used to use rectal valium six times a
[SPEAKER_00]: month and now they've only used it once in
the last two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to them they can see that that's their
objective because sometimes it's hard
[SPEAKER_00]: again to count seizures or clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have two patients that also
have type 1 diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who also the parents reported that it
appeared that the glucose became more
[SPEAKER_00]: stable after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's unclear if it's a metabolic
issue or if the child's not seizing so
[SPEAKER_00]: much that you have better control of the
glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, each and every patient
is an individual and will respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody says what dose, what dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no one dose for every patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just like everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in medicine, it needs to be
personalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually start at about a half a
milligram per pound or one milligram per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilo per day every eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do find that in the beginning every
eight hours works better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some patients are able to go to every 12
hours if they've been successful and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been on the oil for quite some
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just increase slowly every
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stay in close contact with the patients
so that we can titrate up and find the
[SPEAKER_00]: dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because it's expensive oil,
I don't wanna leave them on a
[SPEAKER_00]: subtherapeutic dose for three months and
then check on them then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense to me to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just kind of start going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average dose, as you can see,
is between five and eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of patients under that that
do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some patients are over that that are doing
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on average, I would say the majority
of patients fall between that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, because there's many
different preparations, if it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: working, you can change strains,
you can change ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not found patients, once they find
their dose that seems to work,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't develop tolerance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears that they're able to stay at
that dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this interesting phenomenon has
come up and somebody asked a question to
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Moshulam yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: This terminology called CBD saturation has
come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appears that for some of the
patients, if they've been on the oil for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite some time, if the child starts
having more seizures out of the blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been doing well, all of a sudden
they start having seizures, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: sick, they haven't leaned medication,
it doesn't appear to be anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, somebody came up with this term
CBD saturation, but really the idea is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you maybe don't need so much and
we've been able to actually back down on
[SPEAKER_00]: dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happening is that the children
respond to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lowered dose in at least 25 patients
and everybody says, oh no, you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: lower the dose, what's gonna happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they actually do well and they stop
having the clusters of seizures that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of came out of the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we're using in California is
THCA, which is a non-psychoactive raw form
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really readily available until
about maybe one or one and a half years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a fair amount of patients get
seizure reduction, especially for drop
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to mention cost in California is
an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is out of pocket and the medication
can be expensive, especially if it's based
[SPEAKER_00]: on weight and you have a large sized
child, teenager or so, it can get very
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now John covered autism, so I'm not gonna
go over that too much, but I will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm getting some very good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one human study showing that
children with autism have increased
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid receptors and the question is,
is what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we translate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it appears that there is some
dysfunction in the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have probably 70 plus autistic patients
in my practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I again did a survey and I had 27
patients, parents who responded,
[SPEAKER_00]: children between the ages of three and 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have some patients with CBD,
they were overstimulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just became more aggressive,
more agitated, sleep was disrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: A handful of patients, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 17 out of these 27, the parents
did report some improvement with calmer
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior and really the big thing was
reduced aggression and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very important as John spoke about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for many of my patients, the
self-injurious behavior is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had patients come in with pillows
wrapped around, helmets, mouth guards,
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can get that reduced,
it would just mean such incredible quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of life improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do find that these patients don't need
very high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do anywhere from one to three
times a day dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listed the popular strains there and
again, high CBD can be stinging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stimulating, some of these patients really
respond very well to combination CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and different ratios, 10 to one,
five to one, one to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I often do is have a separate
bottle of CBD and a separate bottle of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and it allows the parents to personalize
the medicine for that child.
[SPEAKER_00]: For pediatric cancer, as you can see,
I've listed here a lot of the side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at cancer in two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is you're treating symptoms associated
with the cancer itself or the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I have some patients that
come to me who have exhausted every
[SPEAKER_00]: option.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've read on the internet that cannabis
may fight cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, because cannabis has been
available in California now 20 years as
[SPEAKER_00]: medical approval, many of these patients
are accessing high dose oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure somebody today is gonna talk
about this a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting about this is that
I've actually seen some really very good
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this slide I talk about,
I refer you to this one particular case
[SPEAKER_00]: report that was published in 2013 of this
cannabis extract for use in a 14 year old
[SPEAKER_00]: who had a terminal acute lymphoblastic
leukemia with terrible genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: She, after four years, was sent home
without any treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in Canada and the parents
obtained some cannabis oil, untested,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had no idea what they were giving
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the doctors were able to follow her
blood work and remember with leukemia you
[SPEAKER_00]: can draw blood and you can follow the
leukemia cells in the bloodstream and they
[SPEAKER_00]: basically did it every three to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they started, and if you go to
the study, you'll see that as the leukemia
[SPEAKER_00]: cells dropped, as the oil went up and it
was a clear cut dose response curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a case report but it did
clearly show two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, she wasn't on any other medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of her severe illness,
they cannot attribute this to spontaneous
[SPEAKER_00]: regression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was clear cut that the cannabis oil
was doing something for this patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a case report of a 16 year old who
came to me a year ago, April, with a stage
[SPEAKER_00]: four osteosarcoma, metastatic to lungs,
to lots of different areas of bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came in referred in by an
oncologist, so bravo to her for sending
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started very low dose CBD THC and
we went very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea about dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to under dose and cannabis is
fairly well tolerated and the parents were
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to kind of push the dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he started cannabis oil in April 2015
and in July 2015, he had PET scan,
[SPEAKER_00]: CT, MRI and a bone scan, all negative for
disease, which is really incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a repeat scans in November,
which were negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called his oncologist and I said,
what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, well, he should be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just saw him last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: His hair is growing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's off chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a little bit beat up from his three
years of chemotherapy, but he's back in
[SPEAKER_00]: school and he's doing really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is, he was on gemcitabine,
and I just put the study on here for about
[SPEAKER_00]: the first eight months of his treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on gemcitabine, which is in one
study synergistic with cannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase cancer killing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I am flying blind a little
bit in a lot of these patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it appears so far that we're getting
some good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never say cure with cancer because I
don't know, but I definitely say extension
[SPEAKER_00]: of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've been given the sign to get
off the stage here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just gonna real quick just say
cannabis treatment of pediatric
[SPEAKER_00]: psychiatric disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are usually very severe cases that
come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not too simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kid has anxiety and usually patients
have tried multiple things and it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start low dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to start high CBD to low THC
because again, developing brain and we
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of titrate up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have to, we add very tiny
amounts of THC just to play with it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and see what's tolerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen some very good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pandas, if you're not familiar,
is something that is still probably
[SPEAKER_00]: underdiagnosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric
disorder associated with strep infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens in some patients is they
get this strep infection that basically
[SPEAKER_00]: causes a dysfunction in the immune system
that creates a psychiatric condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And parents say my kid went crazy and
nobody relates it back to the strep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're starting to see that there's
this relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had three cases in my parents in
practice and I've had very good results,
[SPEAKER_00]: all responding well to CBD rich cannabis
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an N of three but it's a place
to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients, the parents report that they
feel like their child is coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who are making products
for children who want to be part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer to this predicament, we have with
cannabis in our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listed here the most important things
that I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis oil has to be concentrated for
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot give a child 300 milligrams
when it's got four milligrams in one
[SPEAKER_00]: teaspoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many teaspoons a day is that child
going to have to take?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to be concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency and strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a family finds a strain that works,
they don't want to go back next month and
[SPEAKER_00]: hear, oh gee, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't grow that one anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not an answer for a family who has
a very sick child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laboratory testing goes without saying,
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a reliable supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go back to your supplier and
they say, oh, we sold out of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you try something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to work for these
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the best slide of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all some of my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my patients went to Venice Beach
and put cannabis glasses on her child who
[SPEAKER_00]: is seizure free and pharmaceutical free
after 13 years of struggling with seizure
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say this is what keeps me
going is these kids right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever kind of get discouraged by
what's going on with the government or
[SPEAKER_00]: someone in your way, just try to focus on
these families and continue to move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
