[SPEAKER_01]: I am excited to be here today to the,
oh, it's like 30 of you left to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: THCV and some plants that we're developing
that are high THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Phylos is a crop science company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are developing new cultivars and also
seed grown plants that are uniform and can
[SPEAKER_01]: be planted out in a field or your
greenhouse, not phenohent seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but ones that will give you consistent
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've built this program off of
evaluations of tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have great relationships with some
legacy breeders and have enlicensed some
[SPEAKER_01]: of their varieties and pay royalties on
those varieties as we use them in
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to mention in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a pretty big focus on minor
cannabinoids and trying to bring those
[SPEAKER_01]: into the majors so that we can see high
levels of CBDV, THCV, and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a pretty serious focus on
customer support for new growers that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been growing all different kinds of plants
at their farms before and are ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: move into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're trying to bring them into the
world of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today I'm gonna talk about THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of you are probably very
familiar with this cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I wanna talk just a little bit about
what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC is on the left, very familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are only two carbon differences
between THC and THCV, so it's just got a
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter side chain than THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes a pretty big difference in how it
interacts in the body and what kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors it binds to and how it activates
those receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are very similar looking,
and you'll see in the pathway for creating
[SPEAKER_01]: these cannabinoids, they go through
exactly the same pathway, same enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this slide actually, I would say THCV
is a really promising cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's the most promising
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, CBDV is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw a talk about CBG today for
topicals and skin irritations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there are so many
cannabinoids, like ones that Daddy Mary is
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, that no one even knows
about that have potential, even at super
[SPEAKER_01]: low doses, for being important in medical
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So correct that slide and say that it's a
promising cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there have been a few clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a fair amount of pre-clinical
work in laboratory and rodent models to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the potential of THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a listing of papers or studies,
clinical trials that have shown positive
[SPEAKER_01]: responses for different diseases or
afflictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some that have negative results,
and I think that the conclusion that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: come to is that dosing is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need more studies, more doses,
really looking at what it takes to get an
[SPEAKER_01]: effect and where this cannabinoid is gonna
be useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that there's evidence for
anticonvulsant activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be useful for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a Hill et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: paper in 2010, a lot of people talk about
THCV as being a skin and kidney weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think the jury's still out a little
bit, but there definitely seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: better control for blood sugar,
some other markers of diabetes,
[SPEAKER_01]: insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance,
and then there is one study that shows
[SPEAKER_01]: that there are appetite suppressant
effects, although there are other studies
[SPEAKER_01]: that show that there is not an appetite
suppressant effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a study that shows that there may
be improved social and cognitive behaviors
[SPEAKER_01]: in the schizophrenia model, and then also
improvements in neuropathic pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: and finally, something that I think is
really incredible is that it's a potential
[SPEAKER_01]: for treatment of PD, but also for reducing
disease progression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not just symptoms, but possibly
important for slowing that disease down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like I said, these are a lot of
preclinical trials, very few clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the clinical trials have used very
small doses, and I think that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said before, dosing is very
important and we need to look at more
[SPEAKER_01]: doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing a clinical trial right now
just to look at safety and tolerance for
[SPEAKER_01]: up to 200-milligram doses, so that'll set
the stage for doing clinical trials with
[SPEAKER_01]: more levels, more arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then oftentimes in the rodent models
or in the cell-based systems, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using really high doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I list the Cascio paper,
and that's two milligrams per kilogram,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not super high for somebody like
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a 60-milligram dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's kind of high, but some of them
are like a 25-milligram per kilogram dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's like 1,500 milligrams of THC,
I'm not convinced that that's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: realistic in a human model, not human
model, in a human clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we need to do more
studies, more clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_01]: look at different doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there is a recreational
potential also for THCV, and we're doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: little observational study right now to
look at responses to being accurate or
[SPEAKER_01]: active or sedentary, to being interested
in food and what your appetite is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then looking kind of at just a sense
of joy and how you're enjoying a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular product with an even ratio,
one-to-one, of THC and THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing that, it's small,
but I think that we also need a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: observational studies to look at the
effects of THCV as a recreationally
[SPEAKER_01]: important cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the problem with THCV, though,
is that it's typically found in really low
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are reports of some cultivars having
up to about 7% THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we went out and looked at what was
out there, we were seeing, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously you see many varieties that have
zero, but for the ones that had them in
[SPEAKER_01]: some level, it was about a half a percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still pretty small amounts,
and so if you want to make a full-spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: extract and put it in something,
some kind of an edible or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you're still looking at having to
produce a lot of biomass to get to that
[SPEAKER_01]: level of extract that would be viable as a
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would like to bring this cannabinoid
into the majors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that it is important for medical
and recreational applications,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what do you need to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need the trait to be heritable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have natural variation for the
amount of THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do marker-assisted breeding,
but that's all on natural variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need it to not be phytotoxic when it goes
to higher levels, and we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that chemical pathway that goes
from the precursors all the way down to
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabinoids so that we know where to
look for genes that are important for
[SPEAKER_01]: making this cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start with the pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm starting at the top kind of,
and so you have these two precursor
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules, butanoic acid and hexanoic
acid, and those eventually get down all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way to the bottom, and you get your
either pentel cannabinoids, the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: we talk about a lot, THC, CBD,
CBC, or you get to the varins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they start either with the hexanoic
acid for the pentels or the butanoic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: to get down to the varins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next step, so they're using the same
enzymes to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have these different starter
molecules, and then they're using
[SPEAKER_01]: acyl-activating enzyme with the different
starter molecules to get to the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see already they have this
difference in this carbon tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right at the beginning, you've already
got the difference that you're gonna see
[SPEAKER_01]: in the end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you add another molecule,
two myelonyl CoAs, and you add two more
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're these same enzymes,
and so then you get to divarinolic acid or
[SPEAKER_01]: olivatolic acid, depending on which
starter molecule you had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Final step is GPP, on a pentel
transphrase, and taking those down to get
[SPEAKER_01]: to, I'd say, the mothers of all
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have CBGV and CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that final step is you're using
these same three enzymes, these same
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid enzymes, to get to the final
products, either the three varins or the
[SPEAKER_01]: three cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please, I know that I'm simplifying
this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably, what, 140,
160 different cannabinoids that we know of
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only talking about a few of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm just trying to illustrate
here is that we start with these two
[SPEAKER_01]: different molecules and then use all the
same components to get down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens to get to those first bits
that seem like they're the important
[SPEAKER_01]: determinants of the kinds of cannabinoids
that you're going to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have to go all the way back up to
the fatty acid elongation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to go through this whole
thing, but the important thing is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's starting at these really base
molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for butanoic acid, to get to the
varins, it only goes through the cycle one
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it only adds the two carbons on the
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to get to hexanoic acid, to get to
your standard cannabinoids, it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: through the cycle one more time,
just to add two more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time it goes through the cycle,
it adds two more carbons to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this part of the pathway, which sits on
top of what I just showed you,
[SPEAKER_01]: is what's really important for making
those precursor molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bottom right there, the understand the
chemical pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have a pretty good handle on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some really low-level stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important stuff for the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for these other things that are
really important for us to bring this
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid into the majors, we see
natural variation for THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen it all the way from a range
from zero to about 6%.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our hands, we only had zero to 4% to
start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see it as a heritable trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at a family, it segregates
in the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see some plants with none,
some with a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some with more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for phytotoxicity, we're making
some assumptions here, but we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: THC can go to 35 or more percent of the
plant by dry weight and is not phytotoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think that for THCV, we'll have no
problem getting that to a higher level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use marker-assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find genetic markers that are
associated with the trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can use that to grow a lot
more plants than we could by standard
[SPEAKER_01]: methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have these markers that are
associated with the trait, we can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny little seedlings in 0.2 square feet
per seedling plug instead of having 2
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet per mature plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can get 50 times more plants
processed in that way than if we had to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow them all to maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably telling you things you already
know, but it allows us to go faster
[SPEAKER_01]: because we can grow more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after we have tested them, then we're
able to select for those plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: predicted to have high levels of THCV,
grow them to maturity, and test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first part of this is discovery of
the genetic markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an example just with
photosensitive and day-neutral plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go through just really briefly
to kind of describe what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we take a plant that, say,
is photosensitive, one that's day-neutral,
[SPEAKER_01]: we cross those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The F1 plant there is heterozygous for
being photosensitive and day-neutral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you stealth that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the chromosomes get mixed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recombination happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look for plants that are
day-neutral and look at what genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: markers are associated with that trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can see here we've got these
two little day-neutral plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the little p little p's, and they both
share a marker on both of their
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes that allows them to be
day-neutral.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we're doing this with THCV,
crossing a no THCV plant with a plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes some THCV, and then selfing the F1,
and same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Letting genetics do its work to help us
identify this association between the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype and the genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so our first shot at this,
I feel like we got kind of lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a population of plants that
did not make very much THCV at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, that wasn't even the point of
doing this, of making this family.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we made this family, and it's
segregated for having no THCV versus
[SPEAKER_01]: having some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used QTL maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started mapping on this family,
first made a linkage map with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals, and then we had cannabinoid
data on 142 of those, so we were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a QTL map.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found one really strong peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shocked I can't, didn't expect for
this to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started taking a look at some
additional germplasm that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that for the QTL map,
you get, you know, with 142 individuals,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have this giant swath of a chromosome,
hard to pin down exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we needed to do was to go into
additional germplasm and look for,
[SPEAKER_01]: and use the plants recombination to mix up
all these, all the genetic information so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we could really see what's associated
with the trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had 302 accessions from 67
different seed lots, did nested
[SPEAKER_01]: association mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a combination kind of between
QTL mapping and genome-wide association
[SPEAKER_01]: studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's making use of family information,
but it's also making use of the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have lots of recombination between the
different families.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of those, they still had pretty low
levels of THCV, but we were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: confirm that spot in chromosome four and
could start to narrow down what gene was
[SPEAKER_01]: likely responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out it's a gene called KR or
FabG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is part of this fatty acid
elongation chain pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got really fortunate with our
populations, even low levels we were able
[SPEAKER_01]: to do this, low levels of THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were able to identify a gene
that is in the pathway, very likely to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the gene that is responsible for having
some production of THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should note that an Australian group
also reported on this at relatively the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time, and voila, they found KR as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two independent groups finding the same
gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do we know?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that in order to produce THCV or
CBDV or CBGV for that matter, all the same
[SPEAKER_01]: precursor, you need to have this
particular allele of the KR gene and that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have either one copy of it or two
copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had very low levels of varins,
but we know that they get much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what explains much higher levels
besides just making more cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it must be other genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew that we needed to do more work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we looked at additional small
families, same kind of process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had another F2 population and
evaluated those in the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also did have some African land race
seed lots that showed some segregation for
[SPEAKER_01]: varins, which is where we think that the
initial varins were located was in
[SPEAKER_01]: southern part of Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we required is that all of the
plants had the KR allele that would allow
[SPEAKER_01]: for production of varin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we first restricted to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew that every plant should produce
some THCV or CBDV, but what we wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: get at were additional genes that would
elevate that cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we found genetic markers in five
additional locations, chromosome one,
[SPEAKER_01]: four, six, and two markers on seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven is where we typically find the
cannabinoid synthase genes, although
[SPEAKER_01]: different location on the genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had in some of our crosses two
accessions that were positive for the
[SPEAKER_01]: markers that we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they contained between 10 and a half
and about 11 and a half percent varins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are continuing this cultivar
development of high THCV and CBDV plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done additional validation and
additional crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in our validation, we found that one
of the plants had all the markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked so positive, so prominent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it only made four and a half
percent THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another thing is that we had a
plant that made 14% THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it only had four of the markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very clearly, there's something else
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other genes that are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're continuing along this path and hope
to nail this down and be able to share
[SPEAKER_01]: more updates as we find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next steps, I kind of just
summarize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We expect six genes at least to be
involved in this pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that they're involved in that
sort of upper part of the pathway where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're making the precursors and it,
you know, makes different ratios of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hexanoic to butanoic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we also think maybe that there's
something in the cannabinoid pathways
[SPEAKER_01]: where some of those genes maybe have more
affinity to different numbers of carbons
[SPEAKER_01]: in the side chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot more to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an application that we,
that's published for the genetic markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're happy to discuss licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're continuing to develop plants that
have high levels of varin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just this last cycle, we got two more or
three more that have pretty high levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: varin, two more 14% plants, and another
one-to-one that's about 11%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the kind of cool thing is that even
though our varin levels aren't going
[SPEAKER_01]: higher, the flower quality is getting
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the varin plants that have
been out there have been tough to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sprawly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a lot of flower, but it's larpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's difficult to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're getting to plants that look
more like cannabis plants that you might
[SPEAKER_01]: want to produce from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give full credit to the team
that did all of this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see there with the long blonde hair
and the black shirt, that's Erica Bakker.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the computation, all of the
statistics, that's all her work.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's incredible and has really brought to
light all kinds of incredible findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's our senior director of gene
discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breeding team, the next three people
there, John, Jared, and Becca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jared's our director of breeding,
and John's our VP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're directing a lot of the work so
that we get the crosses done and making
[SPEAKER_01]: all those decisions using the markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Amy, on the far right,
leads the cultivation team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without a solid cultivation team,
none of this would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grateful for them every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great hearing all about
cultivation at this meeting and nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and just all kinds of the stuff that I
want to take back to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also want to mention Sarah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is our chemist and directs the lab and
has been incredible to work with on all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these different cannabinoids and terpenes
that we're studying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to give full credit without
this team.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just the person up here talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So happy to take questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for presenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that on the recreational slide
that you talked about, THCV, that it
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned the clear energizing focused
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the chemovars that's very well
known for having THCV, Durbin poison,
[SPEAKER_00]: in its terpene profile, its primary
terpene, is terpenolene, which also has
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same description of effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that result, was that including
terpenolene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was that THCV on its own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how did that come about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mention the dominant cannabinoids
in the plants that we've been looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, it's dominant in myrcine,
which is not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's terpenolene, limonene,
and myrcine are the three dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes for Durbin, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ours is myrcine and osmine and
beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would not think uplifting
energizing at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's another focus of the
program, is to put in those energizing
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
