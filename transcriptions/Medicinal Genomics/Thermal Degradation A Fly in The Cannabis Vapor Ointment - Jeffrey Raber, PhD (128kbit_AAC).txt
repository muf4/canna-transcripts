[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everyone, for showing up this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the organizers keeping the
place so cold so we all stay awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like folks don't like flies,
so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we scared a few of them off with the
title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Douglas is not here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He welcomed a new member of his family not
too long ago, so he's managing that little
[SPEAKER_00]: wrangling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of fun, those little ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's sorry he can't make it,
and hopefully I can carry things properly
[SPEAKER_00]: in his absence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, horrifying title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who let the flies in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we wanted to talk about, there were
some things that we think are coming down
[SPEAKER_00]: the pipeline in terms of concerns,
questions, and what else may be of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest to understanding the products
that we're using and understanding how to
[SPEAKER_00]: best utilize the compositions of interest
to ourselves and especially to medical
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not lost to anyone here,
especially in the case of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: arena about Ivali.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it actually did happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had concerns with products that were
being utilized for vaporization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where those products were at, what exactly
was in all of the compositions of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many of them actually persisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the pandemic certainly
curbed the CDC's reporting, kind of sucked
[SPEAKER_00]: up all the resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last update was February 25th of 2020,
actually, on the Ivali website on the
[SPEAKER_00]: CDC's homepage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do know it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know it can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we think about what happened,
what have we learned from it, and how do
[SPEAKER_00]: we best avoid it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big piece of that was we really need
to consider what we do for inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The molecules that we're going to inhale
are very different in terms of a
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicological profile than what else we've
used them for, whether it be topical use,
[SPEAKER_00]: even oral ingestion routes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our lungs and our route of ingestion
through inhalation is very different than
[SPEAKER_00]: if we are to consume them orally or apply
them topically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to consume them via inhalation,
we have to heat things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rule in chemistry is about every 10
degrees in Celsius, chemical reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: rates may double.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not a very big temperature
change when you start to think about how
[SPEAKER_00]: hot some of the handheld devices might
get, how hot a vaporizer might get,
[SPEAKER_00]: e-cigarette hardware, and especially when
you go all the way up to combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something to not overlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we definitely have to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to kind of pay attention to
what might be the molecular fate,
[SPEAKER_00]: what might these things decompose into,
how much of them might be around,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how do we actually concern ourselves
with this before we put products out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketplace so that we can avoid a
situation like we saw with the Ivali
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's presumed to be the major culprit
that formed Ivali is shown here,
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chemists believe that it is the
phenolic acetate function that caused that
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you heat that hot enough, you start to
see a breakdown into a molecule we call
[SPEAKER_00]: ketene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a highly reactive molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this molecule is most likely what was
causing the chemical burns and the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems inside the lungs and the airways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it forms when you really, really,
really heat compounds like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One current concern that I've got,
we heard it mentioned a little bit earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: today, THCO or THC acetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a phenolic acetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't think anyone's done thermal
degradation studies on it to see its
[SPEAKER_00]: propensity to form ketene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may or may not form ketene under
typical conditions in vape hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still a question that's out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we don't see other problems
like we saw with vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also interesting that vitamins in
vitamin E acetate may still be going
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody necessarily got the memo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it raises the question, is that
related to vitamin E acetate in specific
[SPEAKER_00]: hardware or was it only always just that
molecule?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what temperatures do things get to?
[SPEAKER_00]: How hot are these devices?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the molecule experience for
which period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: All important questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to highlight the point that
vitamin E acetate is grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is generally recognized as safe for
uses in foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not generally recognized as safe
for any and every use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly not for inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work presented here is work from the
Strongin Lab in Oregon State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were exploring cannabinoid
degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the fate of cannabinoids when I
heat them up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Via a vape cartridge or via dabbing where
the temperatures might be a little hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used both delta 9 THC and CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the volatile or
organic content actually comprises a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of different molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to highlight that there is
acetone seen on the top two as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll bring that up a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the basic takeaway from
this is it's not only THC all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start with THC, but if I heat it up,
it might decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls apart into other molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some which may be of interest,
some which may not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those things are really what's going
on when we're heating vape devices,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're utilizing those, and through
combustion processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had previously published,
we know how much is in a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go and combust that,
you do not find 100% of the THC going into
[SPEAKER_00]: the airway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, you can't find all of the
THC's fate because it breaks down to
[SPEAKER_00]: things like this, which are hard to
capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes, unfortunately, do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending upon which terpene you have,
and again, which temperatures you've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will see them start to degrade in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will see a different profile of
the other volatile substances that form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I'd also like to note that
acetone is a lot more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's a laser pointer on
this one or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, you know, the second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologize for the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one on the mercy one,
acetone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one on the limonene one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see certain amounts of acetone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'll bring that up a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beta-karyophylline forms predominantly
acetone, along with some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a little bit of a clue about
what might be going on when we start to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat these molecules under different
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it is very condition-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we produced pure terpenes, complex
blends from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to do a lot of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start to see testing laboratories
come back with residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, how does this start to
happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where is the solvent coming
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not OK to put any solvents
into these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shouldn't be around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if these materials are coming from
distillations, they should have no
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents such as acetone or the other
light volatiles in there either.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really wasn't a rational reason for
why these things might be showing up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part that we did was,
let's just take a vial, an empty vial,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it out there in the lab atmosphere,
and see if there's acetone floating around
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe showing up on some of the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these methodologies are very
sensitive and can detect these things at
[SPEAKER_00]: very low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Residual solvent analysis is done via head
space analysis with GCMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a sensitive technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see very small amounts of these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is possible that you've got a lot
of acetone in a lab or other solvents that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be confounding these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first block there is the empty vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't matter what happened in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a lot of acetone present in
the lab or even in the vials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we tested a series of other pure
terpenes and terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also mixed them all together one to one
to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made a complex formulation that
mimicked one of the cultivar profiles that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see each of them started to
show this general trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little hard to read,
perhaps because it's small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first data point on the left is
when we took the vial and purged it with
[SPEAKER_00]: argon to try and flush away as much of the
lab's atmosphere and impart a neutral,
[SPEAKER_00]: inert atmosphere of argon into the vial,
sealed it, and used that inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: injection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is just laboratory air that
was pushed in after we flushed with argon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to fill it up with air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third data point was when we added
something with a high oxygen content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So boost oxygen type stuff that we bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to put as much oxygen in there
and see if we start to see other
[SPEAKER_00]: degradations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly, we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that the lab atmosphere had a
certain amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you remove that atmosphere,
you don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's argon-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very low in numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you add oxygen, you see those
things go up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results were all statistically
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started to think, well,
I don't see it all going down to acetone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else might be happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also tells us that our sample
preparation is critical to analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big part of analytical chemistry is,
how do I know what I'm holding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do I get it to some sort of
detection method that has not altered
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what I'm holding in my hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of told us that these
residual solvent analyses probably need a
[SPEAKER_00]: little work in sample prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The injector temperatures in the GC,
the methodologies of getting those vials
[SPEAKER_00]: warmed up to put the volatiles in the
headspace, all of those might have an
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on the overall chemistry of what's
going on in the vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not necessarily representative
of what I'm holding in my hand or what's
[SPEAKER_00]: been placed in my vape cart or other
product composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look into degradation,
I don't know if everybody might have heard
[SPEAKER_00]: the talk earlier today about the
environmental chemistry that goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some pretty wild stuff that
actually happens to some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules over time under the right
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just a picture of some of the
pathways that go on in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air, oxygen, other types of things can
catalyze these reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain hardware inside of vape hardware
or metal catalysis might actually be a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to add a little bit of things to
accelerate some of this, and we didn't see
[SPEAKER_00]: any great accelerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think oxygen in the normal air was the
major culprit of these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's still a little bit more work
ongoing before we're actually going to
[SPEAKER_00]: publish all of the results in this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does tell us there weren't really
these solvents inside of the formulations
[SPEAKER_00]: that were produced or these pure terpenes
that we're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's predominantly coming from analytical
methodology, and I think that was an
[SPEAKER_00]: important piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully others will start to adopt
different analytical methodology towards
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding how to get good residual
solvent results from compliance tests as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made us start to think,
like, could we model potentially vape
[SPEAKER_00]: hardware, vape effluent streams,
utilizing gas chromatographs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it a really big, giant vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: In some sense, I've got a liquid that I'm
going to put into an injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to heat to a certain
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to try to aerosolize or
volatilize the molecules that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and then they're going to travel
down the path and we can detect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at a handheld e-cigarette,
it's pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a liquid in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to get hot to a certain
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air flows through it, and these molecules
go down an airway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens to go into our airways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those two things are pretty similar,
so I think there's, you know, a glimmer of
[SPEAKER_00]: hope that we might be able to model some
vape hardware in certain fashions or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least glean toxicological perspectives on
what types of molecules may be formed in
[SPEAKER_00]: which amounts from the breakdown of the
compositions that we're using inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: these e-cigarette hardware pieces or
concentrates, dabs, or even other
[SPEAKER_00]: inhalable products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to note, this is
probably a good picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad put this in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly vegan, so he made sure that we
showed the steak to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can all assess, you know,
different things change via time and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hotter I've had my steak on the
grill, the longer it's been there,
[SPEAKER_00]: the less rare it is, the different in
color it is, the different taste and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, and the different smells that I
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those are telling us there are
chemical transformations and chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: changes that are going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's the time and temperature
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to note that GC liquid
samples, what I place inside this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, auto sampler, isn't always what
the detector is going to be only looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: My injector temperature may change things,
and different chemistry may even happen
[SPEAKER_00]: before it goes all the way down the path
to the detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to consider that that's
also probably happening to some degree
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the vape hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my cannabis extract, my cannabis
formulation may be different than what's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually hitting my lungs, to which
extent, I think is a very, very difficult,
[SPEAKER_00]: complex, and technically challenging
problem to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to send alarm bells off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been seeing lots and lots and lots
of inhalation use for lots of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't see many, many acute
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the, you know, the number of the
valley cases up to February of 2020 was
[SPEAKER_00]: only around 2,800.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably tens of millions of
folks that vape almost every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to keep the number in relative
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one deserves any of that harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even one is an alarming case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not like we're seeing,
you know, tens of millions or hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands every day presenting with this
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a very different scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we kind of confound what's
going on with the chemical compositions
[SPEAKER_00]: and the profiles by playing the name game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we published early on 2015,
I believe, it was how your chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: profile on a flower might not represent
the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of folks will call something Blue
Dream or OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that every one of those
has the exact same Blue Dream or OG Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there is no nomenclature
that's fixed towards chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: compositions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes further when you even say that
this flower was what I used to do my
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it was diamond dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that flower was extracted,
I have a diamond dust concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for most of us, most general
consumers, the assumption is, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the molecules I wanted just perfectly
went exactly ever into the concentrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what I wanted them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemistry experience tells me the
molecules almost never do exactly what I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is a kind of a graphical
representation showing, yes, you pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them off, but they're now in
different ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have isomeric or oxidative
things that have happened throughout that
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are prevalent pieces like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what your extraction process is,
I do not have a perfect process to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: only cellulose or only amino acids and
leave behind just the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: just the terpenes exactly as the flower
produced them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hear a lot of talk, and recently
there's been a lot of talk in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the Department of Cannabis Control
just released some draft regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about which terpenes or terpene
types and ingredients might be useful for
[SPEAKER_00]: inhaled products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of folks thought that their
extraction for cannabis-derived terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: meant that it was exactly what the flower
presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is unfortunately not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably good that we've got
greater diversity, but something to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to and something to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say my Blue Dream flower
necessarily always drives the Blue Dream
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate effects, because those
compositions are very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are approaches that you can use
using individual molecules that will get
[SPEAKER_00]: you to replicate the flower's profile in a
much greater fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with far better precision and accuracy,
you can drive profiles that look exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: like the ones the flower produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, of course, have other flexibility
that goes along with that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that case, you can say this is far
greater representation of what was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that any one of them is
any better than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that this is an exact copy,
or as close to exact as we can get today,
[SPEAKER_00]: of what the flower produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we are trying to say, hey,
we understand these flowers, we understand
[SPEAKER_00]: their use, and the patient populations
that are benefiting from them,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's how we can put those profiles into
other products, such as inhalable products
[SPEAKER_00]: like vaporizers, other concentrate forms,
or infused products like tinctures,
[SPEAKER_00]: topicals, and edible products as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping those profiles consistent,
standardized, and highly scalable is what
[SPEAKER_00]: is really important to medical patients
and the medical population, and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: also to adults and adult brands that say,
look, I have a consistent product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consistency, as we heard from the
cultivation efforts earlier today,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very difficult to come up with the
exact same profiles every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I treat a molecule as a molecule
and replicate that in a standardized,
[SPEAKER_00]: scalable fashion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the individual components and
formulating them will lend towards that
[SPEAKER_00]: type of approach, and I think leads to
great scalability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a good representation of what
the flowers produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, we think it is kind of a good
collective time for all of us to start
[SPEAKER_00]: considering inhalation safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the large bulk of the
dispensary shelves today are inhalation
[SPEAKER_00]: products, whether they are flowers that
are being consumed, concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: or vape products, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things can comprise the significant
portion of cannabis products today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also some unique benefits that
are imparted by inhalation products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain medical patients and patient
populations really demand that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid response.
[SPEAKER_00]: They demand that type of effectiveness,
and they're not finding it from other
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inhalation does offer a unique route,
and I think it's kind of a critical part
[SPEAKER_00]: for us scientists to say, how can I
develop this in a very intelligent way to
[SPEAKER_00]: lend towards the lowest toxicology
perspective possible while delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized, consistent products for
patients to benefit from?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all got started, at least I got
started, because of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of California's forgotten the word of
medical of late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the West Coast, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are an important part of this
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are still driving a lot of the adult
use store sales and volumes, and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's important that they are never
forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important to keep a very good
quality product that is standardized and
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent so these patients can get that
benefit and relief that they deserve and
[SPEAKER_00]: that we all have been fighting for and
continue to fight for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I think, important upon us today to
say, let's come together and start to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about inhalation safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to educate regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see in different states that some
of them certainly don't know chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: very well or are not really understanding
some of the nuances that go with
[SPEAKER_00]: inhalation safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Food Extract Manufacturing Association
had this problem a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They convened their own panels,
they got together, and they said,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's start to understand how we can
assess the toxicological profile of these
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts that we're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know they'll be generally
recognized as safe for use in foods at
[SPEAKER_00]: which levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important, I think, that the
cannabis industry understands that and
[SPEAKER_00]: tries to model that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important that we do not let
happen anyone consider cannabis to be just
[SPEAKER_00]: like nicotine and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very, very, very different
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have very different uses,
very different chemical profiles for
[SPEAKER_00]: importance in use, and it would be remiss
to all of us if someone says, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just treat it like tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a problem, and we would
leave a lot of people in a bad position
[SPEAKER_00]: that are looking to cannabis for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good start might be, hey,
let's take the information in the body of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge that we know that was generated
by things like vitamin E acetate or things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've seen other studies with that
says, let's not use those for inhalation,
[SPEAKER_00]: or these are the things that are found in
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been inhaling and consuming them
even at combustion temperatures for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that those things are pretty
okay and start here because building this
[SPEAKER_00]: body of toxicological work is going to
take a considerable amount of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: money, and effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't have this answer next week,
even if we all decided to lock ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take a lot longer than that,
but we have to start somewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can't start with just some
regulator saying, I think this makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's gonna lend up to being much
more problematic, and really trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: unwind some of those things can be very,
very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the key points that I wanna
make sure everyone understands is the
[SPEAKER_00]: compositions change with all of your
process steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime I do anything, even if that's
setting up my analytical sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might see changes in the chemical
composition that I thought I was dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with or that I put inside of a formulation
or a specific device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraction changes them, and heat is the
major culprit, and heat accelerates
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation with oxygen, air, and other
things that are floating all around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important to get your analytical
methodology right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of current labs today don't
have the residual solvent methodologies
[SPEAKER_00]: super dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're seeing some of these
nuances, but we don't always see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: products fail for compliance testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a way to kind of tighten this
up in a simple fashion, make it easy and
[SPEAKER_00]: more robust, and we'll get more accurate
understanding of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think understanding aerosol testing,
like the work at a Strongin's lab and some
[SPEAKER_00]: others now that are kind of getting along
with this, that field is advancing and
[SPEAKER_00]: using gas chromatographs to kind of
understand what we might see in these
[SPEAKER_00]: heated effluent streams out of vape
devices or even via concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption and other inhalation means is
very important towards informing our
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicological perspective and
understanding of which molecules might be
[SPEAKER_00]: best on a permitted or prohibited list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the name game still persists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to solve this one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe someday in the shower we'll get a
good idea and we'll actually say this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complex problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hopefully will start to get less
problematic as things start to be
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized and more consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can start with consistent
cultivation, consistent processing
[SPEAKER_00]: methods, we should all be able to lead
towards more consistent products in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I described, there are a couple of
approaches that might really help us
[SPEAKER_00]: elucidate consistent formulations and
chemical profiles of those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was a little bit of a funny
one, but chemistry is definitely not to be
[SPEAKER_00]: feared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing in life should be feared as long
as you can understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought this was funny until I was
sitting there talking to a legislative
[SPEAKER_00]: aide and a staff member that were trying
to write rules and regulations around hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: and the novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing that I got after I was
introduced by an independent third party,
[SPEAKER_00]: they said, oh, I did terrible on chemistry
and failed on math.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told that there wouldn't be much of
that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, delta 8, delta 9,
delta 10, and all these other things I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start throwing at you are all
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other than give you copy paste
language, I don't know how we can help,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have to have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not impossible to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these things are what are important
when we're talking about what can patients
[SPEAKER_00]: and consumers access?
[SPEAKER_00]: What might we be putting into the public
sphere?
[SPEAKER_00]: What might cause harm or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do, unfortunately, not have a lot
of science-minded folks that are writing
[SPEAKER_00]: the rules, regulations, or legislation,
especially the legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them seem to be English or legal
majors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are fearful of the word chemistry and
math, I can assure you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to gently offer education and
always available for support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most of us scientists are
always happy to have the conversation and
[SPEAKER_00]: educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bad word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemistry is actually OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my little boy saying molecules
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's under three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But understanding the world around us and
what we can get from that is really the
[SPEAKER_00]: important piece of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you all for your time and
attention today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to take any questions.
Dustin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get this question a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you enable a patient with just a
minute or two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what's the best way to go about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do as much research as you can on the
producer and their consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find certificate of analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to be available in most
states by rules and regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be surprised how hard it is to
try and get those, even when they are
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be available by rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can if you are persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go find all the C of A's that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can probably pretty quickly assess
standardized product and process
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start seeing numbers with wide
ranges, if it's at the same lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: that lab is probably consistently doing
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be off the center of the
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a relative consistent analysis showing
me inconsistent profiles tells me there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of variability going on in the back
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try through experience and
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried different batches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, have that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have these been consistent for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough because we're all variable
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if I get the same products,
I might need a little more, a little less
[SPEAKER_00]: from day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But through certificate of analysis
research and then ask a testing lab or
[SPEAKER_00]: come back to the doctor and say,
I found these 10 things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably can assess pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or yes, that's the type of producer for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the best that we can do today so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm looking for an inhalable product
or a vape cart, how do I assess that from
[SPEAKER_00]: a patient or consumer perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet what's on the label?
[SPEAKER_00]: What else might be going into there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not fearful of synthetic or natural
labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural means safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ricin, belladonna, other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poison ivy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural, totally not safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What molecules are being used in them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any in there that might cause
concern?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I seen that from other states?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty complicated and difficult,
I think, for most of the general
[SPEAKER_00]: population to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But states are starting to require
disclosures on some of the molecules in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a problem with that where
you start to read some of these things and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, I can't even pronounce them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read a report, it might really be off
because that toxicology report might be on
[SPEAKER_00]: the pure substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at high concentrations in just that
molecule, it might be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a vape cart, it said a fraction of
a fraction of a percent, and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dose makes the poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say consistency of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing the same effects if you
used it from batch over batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's on the label and what do you
know about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask the producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're trying to answer in a very good
fashion, you could probably feel more
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable that they felt confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're ducking the question,
that's probably a flag to say they either
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know or they don't want you to know,
and you can probably move on to someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else that would be more transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our GC analysis on acetone was residual
headspace solvent analysis with GCMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are headspace files that were
captain sealed, placed in the headspace
[SPEAKER_00]: autosampler, warmed up to temperature,
injected, and then hit the MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could see acetone was one of
the major culprits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other things that you could
see, obviously, the ones that California's
[SPEAKER_00]: residual solvents on the list that they
look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't detect everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that big complex picture says there's
all sorts of other stuff that probably is
[SPEAKER_00]: present, but the lab's not tuned to look
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see a small amount of acetone,
yeah, that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that slide, it was at, I think,
6.7% or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what that break down into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it broke down to a lot of other stuff
that you're not detecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to try to see how much of
the actual terpene is left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little tricky experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how we got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we didn't do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if I inhaled and then exhaled,
what did I catch out here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what did I keep in my lungs and
bloodstream, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see maybe traces of some stuff,
but my concentrations go down,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it gets harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hook up e-cigarettes to devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strongin's lab's done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, I've trapped all of the vapor
stream coming out of an e-cigarette device
[SPEAKER_00]: or even a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I see this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a couple of technical
challenges with what did I trap?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I trap it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I sure I got it all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it stuck in a tube before I got there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I figure out the entire mass
balance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if I started with 100 molecules of
these and it broke into 30 things,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much of each of those equals that 100
molecules?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't always get there, and it's a
little frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's because I'd probably need five
different detection methods to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure I could fill out the whole
picture, and that's just too costly to do
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the live rosin, live resin,
hydrocarbon extract, sauce, batter,
[SPEAKER_00]: butter, whatever you want to call it these
days, CO2 extracts, any extract's
[SPEAKER_00]: composition is different than the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they any safer, better?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if we should use words
like safer or better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a lot of folks like, I think this
one's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I could try this one or the others,
and we'll see if I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not telling me anything other
than your personal opinion for what you
[SPEAKER_00]: think is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's best is what's right for the
consumer and the patient and what they get
[SPEAKER_00]: the best results with, which may be very
different than what that person thought
[SPEAKER_00]: was best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce different profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the live rosin or other things
might have higher contents of other
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules like fats and waxes,
depending upon how they actually go down
[SPEAKER_00]: the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not all those processes are exactly
standardized or exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two different producers, even doing a
live rosin type of process, may produce
[SPEAKER_00]: very different things from the same
plants, depending upon exactly how they do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think they're solvent-less,
so you haven't introduced anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a pretty good composition that
you're resulting to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, again, is different than what I
started with the flour, and there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: things that change terpene compositions in
that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's similar to heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've done any sorts of things that have
tried to touch these molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may oxidize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may isomerize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may come into different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some folks we know took, like,
cannabis-derived terpenes and threw them
[SPEAKER_00]: through the analysis, and you're like,
well, I can see about half of what's here,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I thought I saw a lot of this
stuff to start with on the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become a lot of other things that are
similar in structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're probably isomers or other
oxidated degradants from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are some of those allergens sensitizers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could they be irritating to folks?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know that some of these molecules
may become ones like that, but we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing everyone present with tons of
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do have some folks say,
I was irritated by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one bothered me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always know exactly why in a
molecular sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's hard to say better,
best, or what's good or bad, or which
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we can consistently produce it,
then we can start to understand what might
[SPEAKER_00]: be right for which types of consumers or
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great question, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So vitamin E acetate bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there others?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states have said MCT because of
lipoid pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know if you have, like, mineral oil
type ones, really long-chain fats and
[SPEAKER_00]: fatty acids, those might pool in the
lungs, and you can't clear those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should stay away from things of
that type.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is that carbon chain until you
get there is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: MCT, you know, if we're relatively
speaking, mineral oil is like C40,
[SPEAKER_00]: and MCT can be like 9 to 12 or 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that short enough to say it's okay,
or is it still too long to be a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the best approach is saying,
what's in the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I use these things that people have
been inhaling and consuming before and try
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep those in relative amounts that
are similar to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've seen that be okay over the
test of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding new things like that can be very,
very tricky, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's a good solution to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen other states take out squalane
and squalene because they were concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: with some cases of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I think it's going to be really
hard to say what's the best thing to put
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, other than what we've already
been seeing and could say, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could say vitamin E was fine,
and vitamin E acetate looks very close,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's not fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very slippery, delicate slope,
and I think it's really, really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: assess without a great toxicological
model, which we really don't have yet
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So staying close to the plant seems like
the best place to start.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opinion of what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so are Delta-8 products derived from
CBD safe or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with the caution of what the
word safe really means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Delta-8, I think, is a fantastic
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a ton of therapeutic benefits,
maybe even a wider therapeutic window than
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-9 because it has mitigated
psychoactivity for most folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yet it still has some, obviously,
or we wouldn't be talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you make that the right way and
you know all of your impurities in that
[SPEAKER_00]: process, it can be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it currently being produced like that
out there today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's many of that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be some, but I don't think
that people are watching what else is
[SPEAKER_00]: formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've screened a few of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of other cannabinoid-like
molecules that are like there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that you can have very good,
clean, safe Delta-8 products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I should be able to test them for
heavy metals, pesticides, residual
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents, and the gamut that we do for all
the Delta-9 products, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our folks actually doing that every time
is someone checking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of the Delta-8 space probably more
like 2012, 2010, California, where
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's kind of doing whatever they
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's really checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some laboratory efforts that say,
oh, I think I saw this, but there's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of reports of, well, this group said
there was no Delta-9, but another lab
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at it and there was a considerable
amount of Delta-9 because they were trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to say it was legal to let that go,
whereas it really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the analysis is probably not
really on par with all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, therefore, I'm not seeing all the
other cannabinoid derivatives that might
[SPEAKER_00]: be forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can do it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think there's a lot of that
going on yet today.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the terpene analysis, no, we only did
those in the head space samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we did not try and put a pure terpene
in like a vape cart or on a dab nail and
[SPEAKER_00]: try and see some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Strongin Lab did a little bit of that
with mercine and some other pure terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: or a model cannabinoid composition,
but we didn't do any of that work directly
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting a pure terpene in a vape cart is
actually a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The viscosity is wrong and it flies right
through it most of the time, so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not always built for that, so that's going
to be a little tricky, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a vape cart, does my chemical
composition that I actually have in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge change over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's very possible, right,
because I'm heating those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what temperature did I heat it to?
[SPEAKER_00]: How hot did it get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of us have probably
experienced the end of this one seems a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot different than the beginning of that
one, so you can taste it in some respects,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know that there are changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are all those changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did they become?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that there's been much of
any study on that just yet, but that is
[SPEAKER_00]: important work to do because the lifetime
of that being effective in terms of dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you're delivering to patients,
or am I forming bad compounds that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't want to be inhaling in that
respect?
[SPEAKER_00]: That certainly is a theory of theoretical
possibility, but I don't have any data or
[SPEAKER_00]: information to share specifically on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right question, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any terpenes present in cannabis
that if I heat them too much become
[SPEAKER_00]: carcinogenic compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've seen things become benzene,
that's a carcinogen, right, so known
[SPEAKER_00]: carcinogenic properties of some of those
degradants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, technically the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we see those at exceedingly large
amounts that they could cause cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: are they overwhelmed by the anti-cancer
properties of cannabis in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're seeing a lot of folks
get cancer, and Dr. Tashkin did a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: meta study that said we don't see lung
cell carcinomas in people that smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're seeing these in the smoke
stream, carcinogenic compounds that have
[SPEAKER_00]: formed via cannabinoids and terpenes being
thermally degraded, do we have a cause for
[SPEAKER_00]: alarm for causing cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we would have seen a lot of
chronic cannabis smokers having cancer of
[SPEAKER_00]: the airways, the lungs, and other things
like you see with tobacco, and we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they technically form, are they at
large enough concentrations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can certainly say the rat gets
cancer when I dunk it in a bucket of
[SPEAKER_00]: benzene, but if I have two molecules
floating around it every other day,
[SPEAKER_00]: does that cause cancer for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a matter of dose that we get to in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically they do, but are they cause
for cancer alarms?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll go with the last one,
and then I'll let Toby get up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I didn't hear the first part of the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably lost more sleep over this
question than any other cannabis question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I had infinite resources,
I was the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now I can dream, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would we do about the naming game?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'd all have to start tagging a
code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sort of large enough sequence of code
that it would be always unique,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like the blockchain, and say,
this is what I meant by that, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: capture it what we can in a snapshot in
time to say, well, what did you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And later, do I have any of it to kind of
fill in some of those gaps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would we see possible groupings that come
from that and say, cool, we can say that
[SPEAKER_00]: this has a little part of the code,
and then I can call it whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think today a good step would be
Bob's Blue Dream, the branded version of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I wanted to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to do away with all the
lineage and all the history that got us
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some nice elements of that,
and it can be very informative to folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't just scrap it and start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we may transition to a place 50 years
from now where no one really knew what
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream was or cared much, because now
we have new names that say, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get there with this bridge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's this brand's Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hey, when I had Bob's Blue Dream,
it was different than Bill's Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they both claim they started Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: They swear they got the clones from the
same guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they very well may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their production process and their
nutrients and their way they grew it and
[SPEAKER_00]: how they did it and how they brought it to
me in the store ended up causing two
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can brand and say, I'm doing this
consistently, and I call this my Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream, I think that's a pretty good place
to start today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we really said, that has to go
to the place that can test the daylights
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it, store it so that if we learn
how to test them later, we can add those
[SPEAKER_00]: things to that info, that might be a way
to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'd probably have to be the
government with large resources and the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to say, I can stockpile all this
cannabis for infinite times under cold
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good, fun question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
