[SPEAKER_02]: Our guest today is Michael Peterson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike has over 38 years of experience as a
researcher and mentor in both the private
[SPEAKER_02]: and public plant biotech space.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has over 50 issued patents and his work
in plant transformation and gene
[SPEAKER_02]: expression is a passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike has worked on many genetic
engineering and gene editing contracts
[SPEAKER_02]: with entities across the globe,
and now he focuses on innovative hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: At CanMed 25, Mike will share his team's
latest efforts to transform cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp plants using gene editing and genetic
engineering in a presentation titled,
[SPEAKER_02]: creation of novel traits through genetic
engineering and editing of cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene, and flavonoid pathways in
cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll also be participating in the CanMed
genomics workshop along with other experts
[SPEAKER_02]: in plant genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: During our conversation, we discussed the
differences between gene editing and
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic engineering, how gene editing and
genetic engineering methods have changed
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years, potential applications of
gene editing and genetic engineering in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and hemp, the benefits and
challenges versus traditional breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center's
gene editing service.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is available to researchers and
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation with
Mike, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, Canapedia.net.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canapedia.net is the world's most
comprehensive cannabis genomic library
[SPEAKER_02]: featuring more than 2,200 genomic reports
on cannabis and hemp varieties from around
[SPEAKER_02]: the globe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canapedia.net reports are easily
searchable and contain visualizations and
[SPEAKER_02]: variant tables that highlight high impact
variants in genes of interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, you can see a report for the
Badger G variety that Mike Peterson's team
[SPEAKER_02]: edited to break the CBD synthase gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you can actually see the dropout
in the CBD-A coverage chart on that
[SPEAKER_02]: report, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Visit Canapedia.net.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's K-A-N-N-A-P-E-D-I-A.net today to
learn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without any further ado, please enjoy my
conversation with Mike Peterson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're excited to talk with you today about
gene editing and genetic engineering in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was telling you before, it's an
exciting topic, a controversial topic,
[SPEAKER_02]: and probably a misunderstood topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really excited to have you on here to talk
through some of these things and really
[SPEAKER_02]: give a nice preview for the information
that you're going to be sharing this June
[SPEAKER_02]: in Puerto Rico as part of CanMed25,
where you're going to be sharing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the work that you and your team are doing
on this topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also going to be a part of our
genomics workshop talking about advanced
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're super excited about that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that we're keeping you busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get into the nitty-gritty here,
I want to give you an opportunity to share
[SPEAKER_02]: a bit about your background and how you
became interested in cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just first off, I really look forward for
CanMed25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year was my first year at CanMed,
and it was really exciting, really good
[SPEAKER_00]: conference, lots of good science,
lots of medical stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really looking forward to sharing what my
team's been doing in the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up here at Wisconsin Crop Innovation
Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the genetic engineering or
molecular biology all my career,
[SPEAKER_00]: so 35 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I graduated from the University of
Wisconsin-Madison with a bacteriology
[SPEAKER_00]: degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined a small startup right here in
Middleton, Wisconsin, just outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: Madison, where back in the early 80s,
we were basically really just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how we could genetically
engineer plants or put genes into plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to make new traits or to enhance traits
that were already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spent a number of years trying to figure
that out, and we invented what people call
[SPEAKER_00]: a gene gun that actually put genes into
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were off to the races then looking at
different traits, mostly in row crops at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soybean, corn, those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company was bought I think about 10
years after I joined it by a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for that company for 20 years
doing pretty much the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene engineering and editing came along
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then recently in 2017, the facility that I
work in, which I've been here since the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 80s, was donated to the University
of Wisconsin-Madison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came along with that to be the associate
director of the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it the Wisconsin Crop Innovation
Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We right there and then basically became
the largest public facility that offered
[SPEAKER_00]: both institutional people as well as
private companies access to put their
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite gene or their favorite trait into
whatever crop that they wanted to put it
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: For five years, I was the associate
director of the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it gets into why I got into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2018 when the farm bill or 2017-18
when the farm bill came to pass,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin farmers, a lot of them in 18
were going hot because of THC levels being
[SPEAKER_00]: too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to destroy their fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a big outcry to see if there was
anything we could do either in breeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering that could lower the THC
amounts in cannabis for growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers in Wisconsin, particularly,
and other states that were into CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wisconsin, the WCIC, since it could do
lots of other crops and was already doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, we decided to get our feet wet in
cannabis and give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortly after we started, luckily,
we were able to do it with similar
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols that we used for other species
like soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 2018 on, we've been offering this as
a service to others that want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: editing and gene engineering in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fascinated by the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never touched the cannabis plant until
probably 2017, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant just has so many interesting
qualities and potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: To hit so many different areas in our
economy, it's really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2021, I think, I semi-retired,
but I was so interested in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back part-time for two days a week
and my lab's been doing cannabis research
[SPEAKER_00]: since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like that first problem that you
were tasked with solving was either
[SPEAKER_02]: eliminating or turning off that THC A
synthase gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the ask by the growers in the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what was the springboard for
us to get into seeing if we could do it
[SPEAKER_00]: through engineering or editing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you mentioned a gene gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the 80s, there were some different
competing people trying to figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: to put genes into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone I believe at Cornell came up with
the idea of, hey, let's shoot genes
[SPEAKER_00]: through plant tissue and see if the genes
will recombine in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually devised almost like a
crossman air gun where they coated DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are genes, onto beads and they
actually shot them into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first official gene gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one we worked at here used electricity
to propel gold beads that were coated with
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, almost like a shotgun approach
to put genes into plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, at what stage of growth are the
plants when you're hitting them with these
[SPEAKER_02]: genes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine it's got to be pretty early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can vary widely depending on what crop
you're trying to put the genes into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants, you start out with very small
protoplasts, which are single cells that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting the gene into.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly easy to put the gene in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those protoplasts, like I said,
in some species, you can make grow into a
[SPEAKER_00]: full-size plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other species are what's called
recalcitrant to protoplast
[SPEAKER_00]: transformations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our group, anyway, starts out with a small
embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the embryo that's within a
mature seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You imbibe it overnight in water,
you soak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever soaked seeds in water,
you start seeing a little shoot coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's root radical and that's part of the
embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take that embryo and we can actually
either introduce the DNA with the gene gun
[SPEAKER_00]: into that embryo, and then that embryo
will grow into a plant like we do with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, or we use a different method
other than the gene gun, and this is our
[SPEAKER_00]: favored method.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a bacteria that in nature naturally
infects plants and delivers the DNA into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells called bacterium.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've hijacked the mechanism in that
bacteria to deliver this DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take out certain genes that the
bacteria would normally insert,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the plant and we put in whatever gene
we want to put in, whether it's a gene
[SPEAKER_00]: that affects yield or insect resistance or
whatever that may be, or a gene that could
[SPEAKER_00]: knock out THC, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what is the source of the gene that
you're injecting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it synthetically created or how does
that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: The sky's the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA is DNA, whether it's your DNA or a
bacteria DNA or a plant DNA, you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: an existing gene from another plant,
let's say, and put it into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a genetically modified plant
by definition because you're taking a gene
[SPEAKER_00]: that is from another plant that normally
wouldn't cross or wouldn't breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's considered a genetically modified
organism, GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in our case, if I again use the example
of our THC free line, we manipulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene that produces the THC and the CBD in
our case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We manipulate that, so we just turn it off
by taking a single base from the DNA out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the gene that makes the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we'll get into that,
but that's gene editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, we use a system called
CRISPR-Cas, which a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to hear about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That CRISPR method different from the one
you described earlier that uses the
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria to put the gene into the genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that you put the DNA into the
genome, is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either shoot it in with a gun or
you can have it delivered through
[SPEAKER_00]: agrobacterium transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a GMO case, you're just taking that
gene and inserting it into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and then it expresses or makes the
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the CRISPR method, you're introducing
the actual CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an enzyme that basically cuts DNA
like a scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a targeting piece of RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes in with the CRISPR enzyme
through agrobacterium transformation,
[SPEAKER_00]: goes into the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that guide RNA sits down on whatever
gene you're trying to edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits down on it and then the CRISPR
enzyme comes in and cuts it right at a
[SPEAKER_00]: precise location.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, we were targeting the CBD
synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the enzyme that actually makes a
little bit of THC in CBD in type 3
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were targeting that CBD enzyme with
that guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CRISPR came in and cut that CBD gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cut a gene and it doesn't come
back together exactly the same way,
[SPEAKER_00]: it shuts it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That enzyme is not active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't turn CBG into CBD or THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant that we made was basically
THC-free, CBD-free, but it had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG, which is the precursor cannabinoid to
both THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same delivery mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just instead of introducing a new
gene, you're introducing the enzymes and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that comes along with CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other delivery methods that
people use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I described with the gene gun and
the agrobacterium, those are the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you started to, and maybe you did
a good job, but maybe you wanted to just
[SPEAKER_02]: re-emphasize the different terms here and
defining them of what is genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: engineering, what is gene editing,
and clarify those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic engineering, I guess, is defined
as moving a gene from one species to
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, maybe if I give an example,
back in the mid to late 80s, the papaya
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was basically being decimated by a
virus called ringspot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the Hawaiian plantations were being
devastated at the time and they couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in a good resistant line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The University of Hawaii and Cornell,
I believe, identified a gene not from
[SPEAKER_00]: papaya, but a gene that would be resistant
to the papaya ringspot virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put that gene, and this was actually
with a gene gun, they put that gene into a
[SPEAKER_00]: papaya plant and found out that yes,
indeed, that plant was fully resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: the ringspot virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that gene didn't come from papaya,
that's an example of a GMO or a
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically modified organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you knew or most people
don't know that most of the papaya plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've been eating since the late 80s
are GMOs, but it's that one particular
[SPEAKER_00]: gene that gives it resistance to that
papaya disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example maybe is a purple tomato
that came out of recently last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out with a purple tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another genetically modified
tomato that was made through agrobacterium
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation, but it just put basically
in genes that were anthocyanin genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making purple tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side, gene editing is a little
different because now you're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: just removing a little bit of sequence or
adding sequence that's already there into
[SPEAKER_00]: the existing cannabis plant from its own
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not bringing in an external gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just either cutting it and deleting
a few bases or bringing in a gene that's
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis already to give it a different
trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the main distinction then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Engineering, introducing genes from a
different plant, editing is just editing
[SPEAKER_02]: the existing genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the FDA or USDA look at it is if
the plant can be made by normal breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: because through normal breeding,
when you take two plants, two cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants together and breed them,
there's going to be a lot of shuffling of
[SPEAKER_00]: different genes amongst their genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's something you can make through
normal breeding, which editing is because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just taking out or adding a few
bases of its own genome, then they
[SPEAKER_00]: consider that editing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point too in terms of
regular breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It mixes up all the genes and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've edited or engineered a new
plant, how do you go about propagating
[SPEAKER_02]: that plant to ensure that its progeny
inherit those traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really no different than traditional
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You insert either the gene through genetic
engineering or change it through editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you find out what the progeny look
like, what its children look like the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow those out in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequent generations, you grow out and
you look at what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You phenotype them, you genotype them
through sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just basically see, have you introduced
the trait that you think you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have and just take it out multiple
generational to see if it's stable,
[SPEAKER_00]: see if it doesn't change over time,
and then eventually bring it to market or
[SPEAKER_00]: launch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you mentioned before that you started
on different crops and then are applying
[SPEAKER_02]: it to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is cannabis any more or less difficult to
work with?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're doing editing or engineering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the word recalcitrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis falls into that definition
because we work in tissue culture either
[SPEAKER_00]: with protoplasts or with embryos in
stericulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a plant that if you start out
with a protoplast or start out with a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf, it's very difficult, extremely
difficult to take that leaf and grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't respond very well to different
hormones and things like that to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: grow into a full-blown plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately for us, at this center,
we focused on that embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the plants we work with,
we focus on that meristem or that embryo
[SPEAKER_00]: to do the work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately for us, cannabis, if you take
that embryo, that embryo can grow directly
[SPEAKER_00]: into a plant, be fertile and have progeny
and transmit its genetic makeup to the
[SPEAKER_00]: children.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of the groups are doing tissue
culture work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're struggling with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's been a lot of
breakthroughs in the last few years to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to make those recalcitrant
plants grow into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of progress there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it won't be too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will be able to do that with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything about the genome that
makes it any more or less difficult or is
[SPEAKER_00]: it all sort of ATCs and Gs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a fairly small genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people know to this date,
and maybe I'm wrong here, why certain
[SPEAKER_00]: plants just don't respond well to growing
up from a single cell start, growing up
[SPEAKER_00]: into a full plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use that tissue culture method when
you're trying to insert genes or to edit
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, sometimes that tissue culture
method only works on certain genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A certain cannabis genotype may respond
better in tissue culture than another
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our embryo system, we can basically do
any genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're not starting out with that
single cell, you're starting with embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can probably do, I would say,
most genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is that something that's maybe more
unique to cannabis and hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just sort of the variety of the
different cultivars that there are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There certainly are a ton of varieties out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an inbred plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much mix up of the genome and
most of the cannabis varieties you have
[SPEAKER_00]: now are very heterozygous in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not like corn or soybean where you
have inbreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cross these two inbreds and you get
this beautiful hybrid plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are really working hard in the
cannabis industry to get to that hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: By trying to make these inbreds,
but it'll come sooner or later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about cannabis is nobody's
really been working on it other than the
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that smoke it and whatever for 80
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been just no research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, in the last five or 10 years,
that's really starting to pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of things will change for
the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess briefly, can you explain some of
the benefits of genetic engineering and
[SPEAKER_02]: editing over traditional breeding
techniques and possibly some drawbacks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Benefits, I think it can be a faster way
to get to your endpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding takes many, many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, many years,
traditional breeders would go out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field and say, yes, I like that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's cross them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then molecular breeding came into play
where everybody knew genome sequences and
[SPEAKER_00]: they could pick out certain genes to put
together that they would postulate would
[SPEAKER_00]: work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That speeded breeding up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic engineering and editing,
you're targeting very specific genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not fiddling with much else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting to that final point can be much
quicker than traditional breeding because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not bringing two dissimilar plants
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: One may bring a lot of baggage with it and
then you've got to go through multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: generations to get rid of that baggage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through genetic engineering, you're just
targeting that single gene or that single
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to change and then see how it
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think speed is probably one of the big
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we know the genome sequence,
targeting those particular genes is
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there ever any unintended consequences
of changing or turning off a gene that
[SPEAKER_02]: affects something you weren't expecting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, I haven't had any plants walk away
at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everybody back in the day was
the frankenfood stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, there's always things that you don't
expect because it's research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may come up with the best plan in the
world and there are thousands and
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of genes that interact with each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by shutting down one gene, maybe you've
got different regulation going on and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not exactly what you would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you learn from that, you go forward,
and then you try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been lots of times where I
don't know if I'd say unintended,
[SPEAKER_00]: but things just don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think you have a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure why.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go back to the drawing board and try
to figure it out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but to your point, it must be much
quicker to iterate on some of those errors
[SPEAKER_02]: or misses rather than sort of going
through generations and generations of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding to finally figure out this didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking sort of big picture here,
how do you think gene editing will shape
[SPEAKER_02]: the future of the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, and I'm going to probably use
these both hand in hand, whether it's gene
[SPEAKER_00]: editing or whether it's genetically
modifying something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I think we can get to endpoints
quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can start thinking out of the
box as far as what we might be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, for 80 years, we haven't done
any research really or not much research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't say any because breeding
cannabis for THC was remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plants that are 30 plus THC
plants and that's all through breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: trial and error and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thinking about what the plant may not
do on its own very well, thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the rare cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw last year at CanMed, people were
interested in CBG, CBC, some of THCV or
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDVs, things that the plant doesn't make
very much of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be able to breed that,
might be able to through many years and
[SPEAKER_00]: many iterations of breeding get to that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think with all the information we
have, with the pan-genome out there now,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can really narrow down on how to make a
plant that's got 15 to 20% CBC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we don't have something like that
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think pharmaceutical companies would be
really interested to see what that could
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a plant that's disease resistant,
has disease resistance, PM is out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there ways we can quickly try to
change the plant so that it's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something it wouldn't normally do on its
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then not to speak of all the other
things I think that are outside the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical world, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The industrial hemp I think is getting
huge steam and it's all a matter of time
[SPEAKER_00]: before we're growing hemp just like we're
growing corn and soybeans I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you mentioned the service that you
offer there at the University of Wisconsin
[SPEAKER_02]: where you will actually do sort of gene
editing for companies or researchers or
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, if you can divulge,
what sort of traits are they interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: creating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do work for other people,
but we also have some internal work going
[SPEAKER_00]: on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'll be presenting at
CanMed this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hear a lot of people, like what I
just said, are interested in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rares or something that the plant just
doesn't produce very much of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard Ken Flavin's talked about quite
a bit, Ken Flavin A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant makes just a little bit of it,
but they've been implicated at a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different potentially cancer, cancer
research, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the rares as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inflammation, I hear a lot of that for
CBC, CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other interests might be
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds, hemp seeds, can we make them even
more nutritious than they are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we add certain amino acids that may
not be there for chickens, for instance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then industrial hemp, again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we make the hemp plant sequester heavy
metals more than it does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know it does somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we make it even better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Capturing carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is a wonderful, sustainable plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a huge root mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'd be a great target for
capturing carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of potential.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, well, winding down here before I let
you go, I wanted to give you the chance to
[SPEAKER_02]: share any links or resources that you
think that anyone listening or watching
[SPEAKER_02]: this might be interested in reading more
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to put the links in the show
description so that they can learn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please plug away.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for sure, I'll plug the Wisconsin
Crop Innovation Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I've been here a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a service that we provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably because I'm not a good
marketer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we provide this service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're one of the very few that
are able to actually edit and transform or
[SPEAKER_00]: engineer hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple others that are just
now saying they can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing it since 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do offer it as a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody can come to us and say,
hey, I want to make a powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's how I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take their gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, we have a group here that
does molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make the plasmid that we would put
into the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would deliver you plants out
the back end that you can do research on
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can give you that link to post on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people can reach out to me directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And definitely, if you're interested in
any of these topics, we invite everyone to
[SPEAKER_02]: come to CanMed this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only will you hear Mike give his oral
presentation, but like I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have the genomics workshop,
which is going to be a really great
[SPEAKER_02]: session.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have a lot of heavy hitters and
a lot of the leading minds in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really excited to have that and
excited to have you part of it,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to seeing you down in
Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
