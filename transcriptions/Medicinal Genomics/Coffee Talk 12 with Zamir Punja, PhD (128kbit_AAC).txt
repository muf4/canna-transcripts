episodes of the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: there as well, so it's a good page to
check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode's guest is plant pathology
expert Dr. Zameer Poonja of Simon Fraser
[SPEAKER_01]: University's Department of Biological
Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zameer's research investigates the causes
and management of plant diseases on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and hemp, including fusarium,
penicillium, powdery mildew, botrytis,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as other new and emerging plant
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: His CanMed 2018 presentation featured
several amazing images Zameer's team
[SPEAKER_01]: captured using an electron microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: The image of powdery mildew mycelia
wrapped around a cannabis trichome is one
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't soon forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure to check out the link to that
video in the show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to his work on plant diseases,
Zameer's team has used their electron
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope to investigate the structure of
cannabis trichomes and will present those
[SPEAKER_01]: findings at CanMed 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect we will see even more amazing
images during that presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Zameer gave us a few sneak peek
preview images that I've included in the
[SPEAKER_01]: show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topics discussed on the podcast include
how diseases infect and affect cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, which cultivation methods are more
prone to infection, how to breed for
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen resistance, which pathogens pose
a risk to consumers, and how each of the
[SPEAKER_01]: four observed cannabis trichome structures
differ and what each might be responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Zameer, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, the Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers Network is committed to providing
the highest quality cannabis content,
[SPEAKER_01]: education, and resources.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zameer Pooncha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Zameer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to be here and talk to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really excited to talk with you
today because I know you've done a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: research into plant pathogens and diseases
that affect the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And coincidentally, our team here at
Medicilogenomics has developed some qPCR
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA-based tests that can identify some of
the very same species you've worked on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So although I'm familiar with some of the
species and I've read about how they can
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the cannabis plant, we don't get to
work with any actual plants here in our
[SPEAKER_01]: lab like you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really interested in getting your
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I think maybe a great place
to start is with Fusarium because I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that your team recently published two
papers on that fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering, can you tell us a bit
about Fusarium and how it affects the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started working on these various
diseases about four years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first thing we did was conduct
surveys of a range of different producers
[SPEAKER_02]: out here, primarily in British Columbia,
although we did get a chance to get some
[SPEAKER_02]: samples from back East in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first disease that popped out,
the one that was the most visible was
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the plants, on flowering plants,
Fusarium will show up as sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: yellowing of the lower leaves,
which is then followed by, in many cases,
[SPEAKER_02]: a wilting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, if the disease progresses,
it'll kill the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in many other crops, it's referred to
as Fusarium yellows.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we saw in cannabis was more or
less a root infection and a crown
[SPEAKER_02]: infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you see a plant that's
yellowing, that's wilting, if you examine
[SPEAKER_02]: the roots, they're going to be brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them may be rotted off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you look at the crown,
you'll see sort of a pinkish orange,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe even a dark brown discoloration that
would indicate that it is a Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see it on those flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even more importantly, we found it on
vegetatively propagated cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the growers obviously start
their plants from cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Fusarium, we saw a lot of damping
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in other words, rather than the
cuttings going ahead and rooting,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were starting to literally fall over,
and they rotted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that came as a surprise to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we isolated from there,
we found a lot of Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And going back to your earlier point,
the main species is Fusarium oxysporum,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the Fusarium that causes a lot of
wilt in many other plants, like tomatoes
[SPEAKER_02]: and basil and lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, we found Fusarium solani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solani is the one that sort of causes more
of the damping off and the root rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third species that we found
just recently this past year was Fusarium
[SPEAKER_02]: proliferatum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one actually moves up the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually causes the crown infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you start seeing discoloration
pretty much all the way to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those three species, you can sort
of tell by looking whether it's a crown
[SPEAKER_02]: infection or root infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whether it's progressing off the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, as you mentioned,
the PCR diagnostic tests are going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the most accurate in telling which of
those three species are actually present
[SPEAKER_02]: in a crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you mentioned that in flowering,
it can kind of present as having yellowing
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there signs and symptoms that can be
visible sort of before that flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: stage?
[SPEAKER_02]: The only symptom I would say is a
stunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, your plants haven't
grown to the same height that they should
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't look like they're really happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you think it might be a fertilizer
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ends up that it's actually Fusarium
that's infected the roots and potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: started infecting the crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're saying that cuttings can
obviously take the, if a mother plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: infected, can kind of take it into the
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would the mother plants really be showing
any signs and symptoms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that sort of the problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where the problem actually
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mother plants tend to not show any
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we think the Fusarium originated,
I don't know, many years ago, even before
[SPEAKER_02]: we started sampling four years ago,
from mother plants or diseased plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: were maybe passed along from one grower to
another or from one friend to another,
[SPEAKER_02]: unknowingly, that they already had some
Fusarium probably in the roots or maybe in
[SPEAKER_02]: the crown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those mothers are grown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're really diseased,
you will get the mothers dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will collapse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously then you know it's time to
get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't see those symptoms and
you take cuts from them, you run the risk
[SPEAKER_02]: of actually transmitting Fusarium into the
next crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suppose, and you can correct me if
I'm wrong, but if you did have an
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise healthy mother plant that
develops the infection later on in life,
[SPEAKER_01]: you wouldn't really see that stunting on
the initial growing phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to tell when a mother is,
well, too old, if I can say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tend to recommend mother plants be
tossed out after six months to a year and
[SPEAKER_02]: not keep them for four or five years,
as some producers might be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that stage, I think you might start
seeing symptoms of yellowing and stunting,
[SPEAKER_02]: in which case you know it's time to get
rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that it's not uncommon for a
flowering plant to sort of have some
[SPEAKER_01]: yellowing leaves as it sort of directs
more nutrients into creating buds and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there more of a telltale sign of
what's kind of typical yellowing versus a
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium infection?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the infections that we do see
that are quite severe would probably be
[SPEAKER_02]: within the first two weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when the plant is producing,
trying to get a lot of its energy into the
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it puts a lot of stress on that
particular plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you start seeing the
yellowing and the wilting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in many cases, those plants actually
die before they get into full flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you've got a plant that's in full
flower, and it may be showing a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of yellowing here and there, that could
just be nutrition or environmental stress
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's Fusarium, it's probably going to
go down within the first three weeks of
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now is there anything you can do once
you've identified a Fusarium infection?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first place to start is with the
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know your mother plants are clean
or there's a way to test those,
[SPEAKER_02]: we actually haven't developed a testing
method yet to test the mothers to see if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're carrying Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of it is, you know, the plants
are large.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know what part to actually
sample for the analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you know the history of the mother
plant and you know it's a good source and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's clean, the first place to test would
be the cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cuttings start dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not rooting well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be Fusarium present there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at a number of biological
control agents that are registered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, trichoderma, glioclatium,
there's products out there that are quite
[SPEAKER_02]: effective in keeping the Fusarium on the
cuttings at bay, provided they're added
[SPEAKER_02]: early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, once the cuts are made,
the cuts could either be dipped in
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium, sorry, in the trichoderma or the
glioclatium, or you can apply a drench
[SPEAKER_02]: before the cuttings are actually rooted to
actually prevent the infection from
[SPEAKER_02]: getting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, so how big or widespread is the
Fusarium problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that's pretty common in
cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The short answer to that is the more we
look, the more we find.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I would have to say out of the 12
or 15 commercial producers I've sampled,
[SPEAKER_02]: every one of them had either very,
very trace amounts of Fusarium to Fusarium
[SPEAKER_02]: in about 30% of their plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's had a chance to sort of move around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on the variety or the
strain, depending on the growing
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions, it may or may not be a major
problem, or it could end up being a major
[SPEAKER_02]: problem in some grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you bring up an interesting
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do environmental conditions kind of
play a role in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that, for example, with powdery
mildew, if humidity is really high,
[SPEAKER_01]: that tends to breed more powdery mildew,
where if you have sort of your levels in
[SPEAKER_01]: check, it's less of an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a similar kind of environmental
trigger for Fusarium?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fusarium, it grows over a pretty wide
range, anyway, from 20 to 30 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: Celsius, or you're looking at 75 to 90
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say overall that as it gets
warmer, as you start hitting the 90 to 95
[SPEAKER_02]: degree range, Fusarium can be quite a bit
worse than it would be at lower
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also seems to like moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, that's kind of hard to
avoid because we tend to really water the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and make sure the cuts are well
watered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium will grow, and actually it'll
spread with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have spores moving from,
let's say, a propagation room where you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got cuttings into an adjoining room if the
water is being recirculated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually get Fusarium spores
moving from one location to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you mentioned that there could
be some treatments that you do to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cuttings after you take them from the
mother to sort of maybe prevent an
[SPEAKER_01]: infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say you already are a few weeks into
flowering and you're seeing those signs
[SPEAKER_01]: and it doesn't look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a lost cause at that point,
or is there anything you can do to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: salvage that plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go in and pull those plants out,
particularly the ones that are yellowing
[SPEAKER_02]: and starting to wilt.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a concern that as the
Fusarium develops on the roots and the
[SPEAKER_02]: crowns, it's going to produce a lot of
spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've got plants, let's say,
sitting on the same table or in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: growing area, you could have spread,
as I mentioned, in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But interestingly enough, it also moves in
the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got fans moving spores back
and forth, you could actually be moving
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculum from that diseased plant or
diseased plants into other areas in the
[SPEAKER_02]: growing room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my recommendation, plants look bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're yellowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab them, take them out, bag them,
and toss them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does that mean that spores could even
infect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if there were some plants that were
further in their development, they have
[SPEAKER_01]: full flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it actually infect the flowers
themselves?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good news, bad news story.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good news is that if the spores do
move around, they will not infect plants
[SPEAKER_02]: at flower or even at a younger stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: This Fusarium seems to like to get in
early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll get in with the cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might get in at the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you've sort of passed that,
the plants seem to be able to withstand
[SPEAKER_02]: the infection level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the plants have made it through at a
certain stage, you're probably not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to worry about Fusarium moving around too
much from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have found that if spores are
produced, let's say there's a plant dying
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's producing spores at the base,
at the crown, those spores once they get
[SPEAKER_02]: up into the air can actually infect
flowers of a neighboring plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got plants a little bit
further down, those spores can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: get up into the flower head and establish
themselves in the flower if the humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: is right, if it's really humid,
and if it's hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've seen what we call Fusarium
flower rot or Fusarium bud rot,
[SPEAKER_02]: which in many ways looks a lot like
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's only when you isolate and recover
that you actually find out it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: botrytis and it's actually Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, would that pose any health harm
or health risk to consumers if a flower
[SPEAKER_01]: was infected with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're probably familiar with Fusarium
head blight in cereals and Fusarium in
[SPEAKER_02]: corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know many of these species,
things like Fusarium oxysporum,
[SPEAKER_02]: can produce mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a risk that if you had severe
infections by Fusarium in the flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: that that could cause certain mycotoxins
to accumulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've only just published those
two papers in the last month or so,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the regulatory agencies and I
think in general, the community hasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: quite recognized that there is a potential
for Fusarium species to infect the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's not something that I would
necessarily raise a flag and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this is the end of the
cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to find a little bit
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say maybe one percent of the
flower could have Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's something that I think we need to
be aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, there should be screening
methods for detecting some of the specific
[SPEAKER_02]: mycotoxins produced by Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really interesting because I
went back and I rewatched your lecture
[SPEAKER_01]: from CanMed 2018 where you were talking
about a lot about Fusarium and some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other pathogens that can infect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that stood out to me is that
you were mentioning that Penicillium,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is another species that can infect
the plant, is sort of a similar thing
[SPEAKER_01]: where it can produce mycotoxins in the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that regulatory agencies aren't
specifically looking for Penicillium or
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be kind of covered under the total
yeast and mold umbrella.
[SPEAKER_01]: But much like with Aspergillus,
unless you're specifically looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: that, it can sort of get underneath that
total threshold and maybe actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: posing a risk to consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little concerning and maybe
something that regulatory agencies need to
[SPEAKER_01]: take another look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you guys at Medicinal
Genomics were the first to actually show
[SPEAKER_02]: that some of these Penicillium species
like Penicillium citronum and others are
[SPEAKER_02]: potential mycotoxin producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this was work that was published
three or four years ago by Kevin and so on
[SPEAKER_02]: and his group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sort of alerted me to the fact
that we should be testing our cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: flower for Penicillium as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, we found Penicillium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Penicillium is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's found in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's found on plant material that's
starting to decompose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's found in compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's found in people's homes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's not something that you
necessarily can kind of eliminate from the
[SPEAKER_02]: growing environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what tends to happen is when you've
got a lot of it building up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say you've got some plant
material that's decaying and producing a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of spores or the floors aren't
necessarily kept very clean or the
[SPEAKER_02]: filtering system or UV system isn't
collecting all the spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those Penicillium spores land on the
flowers and they can stay there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a while, they can start growing
and producing more spores, which in turn
[SPEAKER_02]: can then maybe lead to certain mycotoxins
that are produced by the Penicillium
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know Penicillium is a big component
of the overall yeast and mold count.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you mentioned, all they do is count
numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you're under a certain limit,
you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they could potentially be mycotoxins
building up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned sort of if you have
plant material collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it reminded me of that slide that you
had showed of a plate that you had left
[SPEAKER_01]: out in a trim room and just seeing the
sheer amount of molds and things that grew
[SPEAKER_01]: on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty shocking to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was shocked when I saw that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to clarify there, in the trim
room, those flowers and those stems are
[SPEAKER_02]: really being agitated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're either going through some
mechanical de-stemming process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that physical breakage of that plant
material I think is releasing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of the cloud effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those clouds are sort of moving up into
the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we put those plates out,
when the spores landed back down onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: plates and we had them out for about an
hour, they were just covered in
[SPEAKER_02]: penicillium spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're finding flowers that are
hang-dried and are not agitated to the
[SPEAKER_02]: same extent as buds that are pushed
through mechanical de-stemmers and
[SPEAKER_02]: trimmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That mechanical agitation is causing more
spores to build up on product than if you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually hand-dried those stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to imagine that if you're an
employee there, you're breathing all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that in unless you're wearing a mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure if they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that if you're not,
that's something that you definitely want
[SPEAKER_01]: to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the first recommendation we
made is let's get those workers to wear
[SPEAKER_02]: either N95 type masks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So masks that would have respiratory
abilities to take those spores out so that
[SPEAKER_02]: their lungs are not exposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just the spores, it's the
dust as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Masks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're becoming more and more common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't be surprised if folks
adopted that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that stood out from that
presentation was you actually looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: whether certain mediums were actually
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were finding that some coco coir
that you had looked at was coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was surprising to see as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so again, the coco coir is nothing
more than plant material, mostly fibrous
[SPEAKER_02]: plant material that's taken out of the
coco husk and dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some cases, it's sterilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's packaged in large box and
shipped over from overseas countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's always a chance that microbes
and mold and other things can be carried
[SPEAKER_02]: over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing in particular other than the
penicillium and the aspergillus and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you place that coco in a moist
environment, so you're wetting it up and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're adding fertilizer and you're using
it as a growing substrate, that allows the
[SPEAKER_02]: residual spores that are in there to start
with to all of a sudden start multiplying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we were seeing is that when
you had those coco substrates,
[SPEAKER_02]: spores were being produced that we were
catching on these petri dishes that we
[SPEAKER_02]: were laying out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the concern was simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: The similar to the physarium concern is
that once they get up into the air,
[SPEAKER_02]: they could then land on these flowers that
are maturing or getting ready to be
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're picking up the spores that
were building up as a result of the
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate that you were using to grow the
plants in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not to say that all microbes
are bad, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are certainly beneficial microbes
that may be present in sort of an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: medium like that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've actually sampled recently a
lot of organic substrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you mentioned, the organic growers
tend to use soil and soil is good in the
[SPEAKER_02]: sense that it has a much better buffering
capacity against pathogens than,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say, hydroponics or raku.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the positive side, we're seeing less
disease develop in roots and crowns of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that are grown in soil because
you've got so much of that buffering
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're finding more microbes in the air
in an organic production system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, going back to this idea that soil
has a lot of beneficials and other
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: More of them are getting into the air than
you would find perhaps in a hydroponic or
[SPEAKER_02]: a system that uses raku.
[SPEAKER_02]: The concern, the irony here is that even
these beneficial microbes, let's say
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out of organic systems,
if they do land on these flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: they would be rated again as a general
colony forming unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may actually cause a lot of the product
to fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a general rule, and this is just
sort of a broad statement, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic growers are having problems
passing their product more so than the
[SPEAKER_02]: guys that are using hydroponic or raku.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of that background level of
microbes, some of which are beneficial,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting onto the flower and causing the
plant, the product to be rejected because
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't discriminate right now between
the good and the bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we see on our
end too, because obviously we're involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in kind of testing the end product to make
sure it doesn't have that contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we see cultivators that are
using trichoderma, as you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, and these other beneficial
microbes that might be testing hot for
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these total count tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's great the work that you're
doing and others are doing to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: identify what are these harmful pathogens
that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can develop some species specific
type testing to make sure that it's clean
[SPEAKER_01]: of that and sort of let the beneficial
stuff go through, obviously, within
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the problem is it adds an
extra burden on the companies that are
[SPEAKER_02]: testing, because it's so much easier to
just say, oh, yeah, 10 to the four or 10
[SPEAKER_02]: to the three colony forming units when you
have to start distinguishing between them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need the PCR based type assays that
you guys are developing to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, it's a trichoderma or it's a
penicillium or it's an aspergillus or it's
[SPEAKER_02]: something in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's going to be really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I imagine that sort of the goal
would be eventually to maybe breed some
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that have resistance to some of
these pathogens, whether it be Fusarium or
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew or things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, how long does it take to
sort of do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, and then second,
do we even really have a full picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: all the pathogens that can potentially
infect the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with cannabis, I think breeding for
resistance is quite doable and a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Firstly, there's so much genetic diversity
that I think it's not so much can we can
[SPEAKER_02]: we find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how are we going to find it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the first step is going to be
developing methods for screening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether you're screening for Fusarium
or if you're screening for powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance, we have to have some really
good methods developed that are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: already developed in other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, in tomato again and in
cotton or basil, they've already developed
[SPEAKER_02]: methods for screening for Fusarium and
powdery mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to adapt those methods for for
cannabis and then go out and do a major
[SPEAKER_02]: collection and maybe collect about a
hundred of these different strains or
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes and then run these these methods
through and try to identify, let's say,
[SPEAKER_02]: five or ten.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shows some level of resistance to
either Fusarium or powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think it's a matter of making
crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you induce some male flowers,
collect the pollen, you know, make the
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses like most breeders or most growers
would collect that seed and then run the
[SPEAKER_02]: test again in the next generation to find
those plants that that may have picked up
[SPEAKER_02]: the resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, you know, after three or four
rounds of this testing, we could identify
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially certain strains or genotypes
that have resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then second part of that question,
do we even really have a full picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: the full breadth of pathogens that can
affect cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I go out to I go out to the
licensed growers about once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I go out on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my cannabis day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not and I'm not surprised where we
stumble across new diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to say there's like
hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say we're probably found maybe 10
or 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not to say that that's the
maximum number of diseases were found.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you talk to the hemp growers in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always finding new diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's diseases coming from a different
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's diseases coming from a different
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be diseases coming from a
windstorm or rainstorm that brings spores
[SPEAKER_02]: in from nearby areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point, we're going to max out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll probably have a full list of
diseases that are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think we've got the major
ones, the major ones being powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_02]: botrytis, Fusarium, Pythium, a number of
leaf spotting diseases that are found back
[SPEAKER_02]: east.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, a couple of virus
diseases that we haven't quite worked on
[SPEAKER_02]: yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're the list is getting
closer to being completed.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I hope it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add it to the list of things in the
cannabis industry that we don't quite have
[SPEAKER_01]: figured out yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did want to shift gears a little bit
because I know that your presentation at
[SPEAKER_01]: this year's CanMed isn't actually about
plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually about the development of
cannabis trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give you an opportunity to
talk a bit about that and give us a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a preview of what that's going to
be about.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry this didn't work out for you
guys this year to have the conference in
[SPEAKER_02]: Pasadena.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully next year when COVID gets a
little bit easier to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to talk about some of the work
we've done with trichome development and
[SPEAKER_02]: trichome analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've done is, you know,
there's a standard large piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment called a scanning electron
microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that allows you to do is actually
magnify the bracts and the other tissues
[SPEAKER_02]: surrounding a cannabis flower where you
can magnify, let's say, 10,000 times and
[SPEAKER_02]: really get in there and start looking at
these developing trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've found two or three really
interesting things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first would be that we've found four
different trichome types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I'll come back to that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's at least four different types.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that we're all familiar with,
of course, are the stopped glandular
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the ones that produce most of
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found the different types.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also found that there appears to be
changes in numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those four as the plant matures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, again, as you probably would
expect, more of the glandular stock
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes are being seen as the flowers
tend to mature because they're the ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're sort of the horsepower behind
producing all the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing we did see is
some differences between varieties or
[SPEAKER_02]: between genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the excitement there is that if you
could correlate those different trichome
[SPEAKER_02]: types or different trichome numbers to
final THC, CBD, and other cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: ratios, then that would be a really
powerful way to say, okay, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: use, well, maybe not a scanning
microscope, but I'm going to use a way to
[SPEAKER_02]: magnify those flowers and look at them and
see how many trichome types do I have and
[SPEAKER_02]: how many total numbers of trichomes do I
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that going to be a way for me to
tell whether I've got 12% THC or 20% THC
[SPEAKER_02]: or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of where we're going with
this study is trying to correlate what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're seeing visually with some
biochemical analysis of those flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible that the different trichome
types could actually be producing
[SPEAKER_01]: different cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me just tell you sort of what those
four types are.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first type is sort of the hair-like
projections, the stacoliths as we call
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which really don't produce any
cannabinoids at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a protective function.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones that, you know,
these humongous hair-like structures that
[SPEAKER_02]: if I was an insect and I stumbled into
them, it's going to be game over for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those definitely have a protective
role.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as I mentioned, there's the stalk
glandular trichomes, the ones that produce
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a shorter form of those,
which are what we call the sessile
[SPEAKER_02]: glandular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sessile are pretty much,
the same as the glandular except they have
[SPEAKER_02]: way lower levels of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, they're an immature form
of the stalk glandular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of the second type.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third type is what we call bulbous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bulbous are tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so small that you could never see
them even with a magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to have a high-power
microscope to see those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't know what those are doing
in terms of their function.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they producing cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they producing terpenes maybe?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the fourth type is what we call
the peltate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are sort of like half-moon
shaped.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the microscope, they're half-moon
shaped.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like saucers, upside-down saucers
sitting on the surface of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a stalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty large.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I don't know what the function
of those are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought reading through the
abstract, it looked like you had looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: two different types or two different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible that if you were to survey
more, you might even find other types of
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we picked those two because they
differed quite a bit in the THC content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one was like 10% and the other was like
around 18%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we saw that in the 18%,
the higher THC, CBD type strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: there were larger numbers of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stalks on those trichomes were
much longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, they were the type of
strain that you looked at with a hand
[SPEAKER_02]: lens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could see the trichomes really
clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could differentiate whether or not
they were sort of the milky type or
[SPEAKER_02]: whether they were the sort of the amber
colored type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least for those trichomes,
we think there's a correlation between the
[SPEAKER_02]: final THC content and the trichome
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I look forward to seeing those
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are anything like the photos that
you presented at CAM-Ed 2018 with the
[SPEAKER_01]: close up of powdery mildew and things like
that infecting the plant, that's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing stuff to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage anyone to go back and view the
video of Zamir's presentation at 2018
[SPEAKER_01]: because that was certainly a hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I tell you, Ben, these pictures are
way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was really, really excited next
year to try to present those because I
[SPEAKER_02]: look at them every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'm like, I'm in outer space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting on the moon somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these huge projectiles, because
they're massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the microscope, they're scanning.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just an amazing sight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great place to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again, Zamir, for taking the time
to talk with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to seeing you out in
Pasadena this spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate all the work you guys are
doing and hosting all these CAM-Ed
[SPEAKER_02]: conferences.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a great way to meet people,
a great way to socialize.
