[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Hunter Land.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Vice President of Research and
Development for BRC.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who don't know,
BRC, we're a schedule one research
[SPEAKER_01]: facility and manufacturing producer of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in research about 20 years,
12 has been focused on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I picked up a couple of disclosures
along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I've come to talk to you a little
bit about cannabinoids, aging,
[SPEAKER_01]: and potential effects on neurological
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: The start of this, it began with
conversations with the FDA around the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: laws and how to effectively determine a
safe dose of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: The FDA was very interested in,
you know, acutely we're not seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: anything toxic, but what happens when you
take this for long periods of time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially, you know, decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a, it's very difficult to do
that type of work in mammalian models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rodents take years and it's quite costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the models that is used for that
is the C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at CBD in this model,
which I'll tell you about those results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabigero in that model as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that brought us to, well,
if we're seeing this in healthy wild type,
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens in diseased models,
which brought us to the Tau model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans?
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have the best characterized
genetics of any animal that we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the metabolic signaling pathways
are conserved with humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have short lifespans, three to four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is high throughput.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at a bunch of different
compounds very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to track life movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do this with AI and machine
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as toxicity and safety goes,
it's as predictable as many mammalian
[SPEAKER_01]: models.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like the canary in the coal
mine approach just with nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This model is accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EPA likes this model.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't know exactly what's in,
let's say contaminated water, we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what to test for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can determine if it's toxic just by
utilizing the C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans model.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they die quicker, probably don't want
to spend much time in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You certainly don't want to drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same kind of application here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also been used by NASA and the
International Space Station to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: determine what are the effects at
atmosphere for long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first study we looked at,
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you don't see on this slide is the
initial study where we tried to determine
[SPEAKER_01]: what the therapeutic range was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's done through thermotolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we saw was the three doses or the
dose ranges were 10, 40, and 100
[SPEAKER_01]: micromolar, where we weren't seeing
toxicity and actually some potential
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction in stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the doses that we used for
this particular lifespan model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did ultimately see increased
lifespan in all three doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the 40 micromolar being the best and
an extension of approximately 18% in
[SPEAKER_01]: lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So positive, they didn't live forever,
but it's roughly consistent with what you
[SPEAKER_01]: would see with things like resveratrol or
metformin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, not compared in this specific
study, but looks positive and non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also looked at movement, which is a
indicator of health and good health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we again saw improvement in health
span characteristics, this activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was primarily in the 40 micromolar
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see if you look at day 12 to
day 15, the green being the 40 micromolar,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see that's almost consistent with what
you see in the normal healthy nematodes
[SPEAKER_01]: without CBD at day 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is a C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans model, but it would be great if,
you know, 80 year old humans acted more
[SPEAKER_01]: like 60 year old humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So exciting, but again, take it,
you know, in the confines of this model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely positive and potentially good
in the wellness sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you moved on to cannabigerum,
which has been an interest of mine as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as many others here for some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually found in the
thermotolerance test that it was much more
[SPEAKER_01]: well tolerated than CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you notice the dose range we have
here, 7.5, 75 and 375 micromolar higher
[SPEAKER_01]: than what we tested at CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because the initial toxicity
wasn't seen with cannabigerum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we see the middle dose,
the 75 micromolar extending mean lifespan
[SPEAKER_01]: by about 19%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, looks positive, doesn't look
toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: We of course shared this with FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure they cared much, but we did
share.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also looked at health span,
a bit more variable in this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, the middle dose at day 15,
we see increase locomotor activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, another positive cannabigerum
seems to extend lifespan, at least in
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes and health span characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brought us to, well, that's great
for the wellness category and for people
[SPEAKER_01]: that may want to utilize this as a
supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about in diseases?
[SPEAKER_01]: What disease model in C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans has been accepted?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we landed on the TAL model of C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many, for those of you that aren't
familiar with TAL, I imagine most of you
[SPEAKER_01]: are, but it is characterized by these
intercellular aggregates of this TAL
[SPEAKER_01]: protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is it disrupts
signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also affects mitochondrial motility.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many ramifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see this not just in Alzheimer's
dementia, but also traumatic brain injury,
[SPEAKER_01]: epilepsy, stroke, even cancer,
and some other specific diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in instance of concussion,
the movement between the gray matter and
[SPEAKER_01]: the white matter can stretch the neurons
resulting in increased TAL expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how much it causes disease
or it's a symptom, but it's definitely in
[SPEAKER_01]: this model, these nematodes don't live
nearly as long as their counterparts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we use this TAL strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's BR5270, and they have drastic
reductions in survival compared to wild
[SPEAKER_01]: type.
[SPEAKER_01]: The design was we had a vehicle control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just the BR5270, the TAL C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had positive control of the
40-micromolar CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep in mind, there's not really a
great positive control for TAL.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had that, we would probably treat a
lot more diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did know that it was effective in
wild type at life extension and health
[SPEAKER_01]: span improvements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've stuck with this kind of optimal
dose that we found in the previous study.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the exploratory test articles,
we looked at, we've been in partnership
[SPEAKER_01]: with Conerta, so thank you, Conerta,
for providing the Canflavins because those
[SPEAKER_01]: are difficult to produce and we don't have
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also for informing on study design as
far as dosing and concentrations are
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned as it relates to Canflavins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the goal here was to look at,
initially to look at Canflavins
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically at compared to CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those were matched 40, 20, and five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 40 being the exact dose of CBD,
and then 20 and five as reduced doses or
[SPEAKER_01]: exposures of Canflavins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we looked at a botanical drug
substance which contained at those
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 80-micromolar, that is CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that does not include the CBG component
and the THC component and the other minor
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that are in this botanical
drug substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can essentially do a direct
comparison at the 40-micromolar group of
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD isolate versus CBD BDS plus the other
constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at 20 would be roughly half the
CBD exposed as the control group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, we combined them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said, what happens when you combine
CBD, CBG, Delta 9 THC, the minors and
[SPEAKER_01]: Canflavins versus the isolate?
[SPEAKER_01]: So really trying to figure out,
is there some rational polypharmacy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there this entourage effect or is it
more of a non-terrage effect which you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see in some models and with some
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was completed in triplicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, we looked at the Canflavins and
you can see the separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the brown and the
orange, that's clearly separating from the
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green and then once more from the
purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see this nice trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they're not living forever,
but they don't live very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you move into the t-test,
you can see the control CBD at day 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at lower blue bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that's about 4% survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty poor outcome if you're a BR 5270
C elegans and you don't get anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, about double nice trend, but not as
good as what we see Canflavins alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we've got 40 micromolar
Canflavin looking superior to CBD alone
[SPEAKER_01]: and 20 micromolar Canflavin, again,
superior to CBD alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved on to look at the same group,
but with the botanical drug substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is CBD, CBG and Delta 9 THC versus
CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD versus control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this nice trend and kind of this
early bump in survival at day eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking very positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you move into survival and again,
back to the t-test, you see 22% survival
[SPEAKER_01]: and 19% at 80 and 40 micromolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, about double, a little bit more
than double in the 80 micromolar,
[SPEAKER_01]: but almost double at a match.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD dose and still once again,
even better at the 20 micromolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, positive, positive both at day
12 and day 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finally we looked at the Canflavin plus
the botanical drug substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We again see elevation early on day eight,
a little bit better than what we saw with
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD BDS on its own and certainly better
than CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that trend continues through
throughout the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we move into this overall, not seeing
at day 16, not seeing significantly better
[SPEAKER_01]: survival than we saw with just the
botanical drug substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we do see some improvements kind
of midlife.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at that day 12,
56% versus 39, pretty much across all dose
[SPEAKER_01]: groups, very positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, even the 20 micromolar dose at
14% survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than 10 and certainly better
than four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about three to four fold higher
survival levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing that we looked at was
activity levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite difficult to examine activity
levels because these nematodes were so
[SPEAKER_01]: entangled with TAL, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't really see very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that we saw in terms of
positive was at day eight with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canflavin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw a little bit increase,
a statistical increase in motility at day
[SPEAKER_01]: eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see it with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see it with any of the botanical
drug substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a positive note, we didn't see the
sedation or we didn't see lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: activity, which the cliche would be that
maybe stoned C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans don't move around as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't see toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see decreased activity and only
a slight increase with Canflavin at day
[SPEAKER_01]: eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, there's kind of a rule
of thumb that I've come up with working
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're schedule one DEA facility
and you're working with a partner that has
[SPEAKER_01]: a schedule one license and it should be
really easy to send 25 grams of THC to
[SPEAKER_01]: them, it still takes three months for the
DEA to add a protocol and for you to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to ship the product there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've shared today is preliminary
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking to see specifically if
there have been changes in the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: TAL and the C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have plans to do further research
with this data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that information's not available yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure one of the questions that come
up, these concentrations seem high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you provide a little translation for
us about whether these are achievable
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, say in a mammal or what the
comparative dosing might be?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a great question, even.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the concentrations are
actually delivering living environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're consuming essentially the
bacterium of the E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli that is exposed to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're consuming CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the actual intracellular levels are not
this high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much more consistent with what we
would get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about the 80 micromolar would be
consistent with exposure in the Epidiolex
[SPEAKER_01]: trial at 20 makes per kick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you go down, you have about half
that at 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, further reduced at 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not exact, but that is the best way
that we've been able to kind of come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with the correct physiologically relevant
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, not quite like oncology studies
where you're looking at these super high
[SPEAKER_01]: exposures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does tend to mimic more whole organism,
real life kind of situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
