[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Can Med Coffee Talk
podcast, where we talk with the leading
[SPEAKER_01]: minds in cannabis science, medicine,
cultivation, and safety testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: who will be part of the Can Med 2020
conference in Pasadena, California,
[SPEAKER_01]: this September 20th through 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this episode, we talk with our Can Med
2020 medicine keynote presenter,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Bonnie Goldstein of Canna Centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie is a Can Med state people.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, she has either presented at or
attended every Can Med event, going back
[SPEAKER_01]: to our very first at Harvard Medical
School.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has also been a very important part of
the Can Med advisory board, where she
[SPEAKER_01]: helps to shape the content of the
conference each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie has treated thousands of patients
with cannabis medicine, and as I learned
[SPEAKER_01]: from our conversation, her patients range
in age from just a few weeks to 90 plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a lot about how she goes about
evaluating patients, determining
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations, and dosing these patients in
our conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are excited to have Bonnie as a keynote
at Can Med 2020 this year, but that will
[SPEAKER_01]: not be the only way she's contributing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie is also leading a full day medical
practicum, along with Dr. Dustin Sulak,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Kevin Spillman, and Eloise Thiessen,
who is a board certified MP.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great opportunity for healthcare
professionals to learn about the latest
[SPEAKER_01]: research into cannabinoid therapies and
also tap into the deep clinical experience
[SPEAKER_01]: the instructors have to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you consider that most medical
schools don't teach the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system, courses like this are really the
only way healthcare providers can learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about how to properly administer
cannabinoid therapies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Attendees will walk away with practical
information about the different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: extractions and products that are on the
market and optimal dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn more at canmedevents.com slash
practicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The practicum kicks off this year's Can
Med 2020 on September 20th and will be
[SPEAKER_01]: followed by two full days of oral and
poster presentations about the latest
[SPEAKER_01]: research into cannabis science,
medicine, cultivation, and safety testing.

[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Bonnie, I want to thank this episode
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, the American Cannabis Nurses
Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ACNA is a national organization
dedicated to expanding the knowledge base
[SPEAKER_01]: of endocannabinoid therapeutics among
nurses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their mission is to advance excellence in
cannabis nursing practice through
[SPEAKER_01]: advocacy, collaboration, education,
research, and policy development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn more at cannabisnurses.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
here's my conversation with Dr. Bonnie
[SPEAKER_01]: Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, again, I want to thank you for
taking the time to join us today and what
[SPEAKER_01]: must be a hectic time for you and your
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: How has this pandemic affected your
practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've changed from in-person
appointments to all now via telemedicine
[SPEAKER_00]: or telephone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we certainly don't want to put
anybody who's sick at risk or even healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: people at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're following social distancing and
lockdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm encouraging all my patients to try as
much as they can to limit their exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, I take care of many sick
children who have epilepsy, autism,
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, all kinds of serious conditions,
and certainly coronavirus would not be
[SPEAKER_00]: something that would be a good thing for
them to get at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping everybody is staying home
and just hanging in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And has it been more difficult to access
cannabis and get their medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Apart from people just being fearful of
going out and having exposure,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really has not been.
[SPEAKER_00]: California has deemed cannabis medicated
medicine as essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have children, if they miss a dose of
oil, who will have a terrible seizure and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially end up in the hospital and
potentially it could be deadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not haphazard here and there
use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is medicine for so many of my
patients and so many Californians as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as in other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unfortunate that there are people
out there who think that this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary medicine, but there are people
who just obviously are still unenlightened
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as I can tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fortunately in California and here in
Massachusetts, where we're located too,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's great that cannabis has been deemed
as essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you would have expected
when you first began treating your
[SPEAKER_01]: patients with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, because remember, I'm on the
medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people who are usually in my office
as a last resort.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've sought every type of treatment and
they don't know why cannabis would help
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know the science behind it,
but they show up and ask, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to use this because somebody
told me it might help or I want to try it
[SPEAKER_00]: or can you tell me more about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I knew about the medicinal
properties because, you know, my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, but also reading the
scientific literature and following the
[SPEAKER_00]: research that is ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's this statement a
lot because there's not enough research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to read it and learn about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, look, there's three day
conferences about all the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just there's a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we are missing is the ability in
the United States to do human clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trials, but they are being done elsewhere
and they are certainly showing that even
[SPEAKER_00]: if we don't get to the primary endpoint
that we might be seeking, meaning,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, you know, everybody has pain relief or
whatever, we are certainly seeing that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is safe and well tolerated and there's
really no increased danger with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, one of the things I tell people
is over and over again, if you just go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the scientific literature and just
read the clinical trials in humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you will see is it says well
tolerated very minimal side effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless they go very, very high dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, with very high doses of
anything, you may push into the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects, but usually with cannabis
medicine, you don't need very high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, going back to this essential
medicine part of it, it's an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're calling it an essential medicine,
but yet California, where I practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: is charging medical patients ridiculous
taxes on their essential medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now have a little bit of a conflict
and maybe this can be something that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can use after the pandemic kind of settles
down and we have a handle on it to
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially protect medical patients using
cannabis from the tax burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, if you think about
somebody who's ill, they're not working,
[SPEAKER_00]: they might be on a fixed income and then
it's out of pocket, certainly not covered
[SPEAKER_00]: by insurance, and then the state is taxing
them on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, the big point here is that you
do not pay taxes on your other medications
[SPEAKER_00]: like your pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not taxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why they're taxing medical patients is
beyond me and I feel that it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: disingenuous to call it essential medicine
and then slap a whole bunch of taxes on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that that would be an
opportunity to get that changed,
[SPEAKER_01]: to say that, yeah, you're deeming it
essential in the time of a pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you deem it as essential after
the fact and remove that tax?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a great thing,
a great change to come out of all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to work on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did want to talk about the types of
patients that you see in your practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned that you're treating
children.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the typical ages?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's typically coming to see you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of age group, my youngest
patient is six weeks old when he
[SPEAKER_00]: presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a genetic syndrome that caused
terrible seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the physician taking care of the
patient was on board with cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: he had seen this syndrome before and knew
that the medications that are currently
[SPEAKER_00]: available for seizures in that particular
instance were not very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my oldest patient was about 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have colleagues who have patients who
are even older than that, 103,
[SPEAKER_00]: 105.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of age, we all have an
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really doesn't matter how old you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real contraindication in terms
of age to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly I do specialize in pediatrics
because that was my background as a
[SPEAKER_00]: pediatric trained physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did pediatric emergency medicine for
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm comfortable with sick children and
helping kids who have complex medical
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In children, I'd say the most common
conditions are treatment-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy, autism, cancer, GI disorders
like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,
[SPEAKER_00]: autoimmune disease, a lot of genetic
syndromes that have either medical or
[SPEAKER_00]: behavioral components to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really it runs the gamut in pediatrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in adults, obviously there's a
lot of conditions that we see,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the top three are chronic pain,
anxiety, depression, and then also
[SPEAKER_00]: insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, those three often run
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have chronic pain, you're probably
not sleeping great, and you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety and depression, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have anxiety and depression,
sometimes you'll have other medical
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions where pain plays a big role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sleep is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so many people struggling with
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sleep industry is multibillion dollars
in the United States between
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals and other treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do find that about 90% or even a
little bit more than that of patients that
[SPEAKER_00]: will try cannabis report and improvement
in sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few things I wanted to unpack
from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first being that I didn't realize you
had such a wide range of ages that you
[SPEAKER_01]: were treating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me curious, how does
endocannabinoid function change with age?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there sort of a time where it falls off
in older folks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in children, they have an immature,
like everything about a child's body and
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous system and brain is immature,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're babies, and then they're
growing in school age and then into
[SPEAKER_00]: teenage years, and they're constantly
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think about someone born yesterday
and 18 years from now, completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different human.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to understand that the
endocannabinoid system is present at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of life and through fetal
growth, and then is there during infancy
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on, and it goes through changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the levels of endocannabinoid and the
cannabinoid receptors are all changing and
[SPEAKER_00]: are somewhat different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find it's very counterintuitive,
but it appears from some research that
[SPEAKER_00]: children are less sensitive to the effects
of THC than adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would think, oh my gosh,
they're little, they would be more
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive, but they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be less sensitive to the
intoxicating effects, and that's because
[SPEAKER_00]: their endocannabinoid system is quite
immature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have probably less density of
cannabinoid type 1 receptors where THC
[SPEAKER_00]: interacts and causes the intoxicating
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as people age, their
endocannabinoid system, it's been shown,
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to, for lack of a better word,
atrophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think about somebody who's old,
how their muscles kind of, their muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: mass goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know brain starts to shrink as you get
older.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very similar, their endocannabinoid
system starts to deteriorate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's maybe a strong word for it,
but it does start to succumb to the aging
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly what we know our
endocannabinoid system to do is to play a
[SPEAKER_00]: very well-described protective role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as somebody ages, I really believe
that they should have support and
[SPEAKER_00]: augmentation of their endocannabinoid
system through using cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help continue the protective process as
they get older.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's interesting about children
being less sensitive to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the same with other cannabinoids
like CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, remember THC is the one that works
directly at the, THC has multiple targets,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, in the body, but it's the one
that binds directly to the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor, giving the well-known effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD has some action within the
endocannabinoid system, but it has many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many actions, what we call non-cannabinoid
system mechanisms of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it targets many other receptors and
many other locations, enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: transporters in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, I don't know that it's been
researched in terms of sensitivity to CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in a way you almost would not
necessarily be able to know because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't always see immediate effects from
CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give it and somebody says,
well, I don't feel anything, but
[SPEAKER_00]: meanwhile, it's doing something,
you know, it's anti-inflammatory,
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidant, neuroprotective,
anti-epilepsy, but they may say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I don't feel it, meaning the same as
most people who take THC will tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I feel it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be difficult to assess,
but I do find that young children who,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, going through cancer treatment,
or going through who have epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we give them THC that might,
the dose that might intoxicate an adult,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, you know, I stay in very close touch
with the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell them, there's what I call
the ceiling dose, and the ceiling dose of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is the dose at which you feel
intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though a child may not be able to
describe that, I will tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: parents know their children very well,
and they'll call me and say, my child's
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes are a little red, he looks a little
glassy, seems kind of mellow, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've probably hit the ceiling dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's surprising, though, in these
young children just what that dose is,
[SPEAKER_00]: because many of my adult patients may not
even be able to get to that dose,
[SPEAKER_00]: because their ceiling dose is so much
lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not everybody, and again, there's
always outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must understand that everybody's
endocannabinoid system is different,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically programmed and determined,
and how we react to cannabinoids is very
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's similarities, of course,
but you know, what I'm talking about with
[SPEAKER_00]: children is we can't just, you know,
like, and people will say, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what about all the overdoses that,
you know, all these hospitals may see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because if you leave your edible
that has 100 milligrams laying around,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, a child, if they ate 100
milligrams, they're gonna be intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about low medicinal doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so let's get into dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first, I wanted to ask you,
where do you sort of come down on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the debate or the divide between sort
of whole plant medicine versus like
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, as scientists and researchers,
we must know what isolated compounds do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know what does CBD do,
what is CBD responsible for?
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you can make any treatment plan
for somebody, you have to know how these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's important that people
understand that, yes, in research,
[SPEAKER_00]: we use isolated compounds to understand
the mechanisms of action and the
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic benefits or detriments of
phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a nice body of research that
shows that these compounds clearly work
[SPEAKER_00]: together, enhancing each other,
but also minimizing some of the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: unwanted effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, CBD can buffer a little,
you know, some of the high from THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost what we call antagonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have opposite effects at the
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so knowing that, we can use that to
our benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's important, hang on one second,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's important to understand about
that is that even though a study might
[SPEAKER_00]: show isolated CBD did X, Y, and Z in the
study, if we use whole plant, which I will
[SPEAKER_00]: share with you, I always encourage whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I remove medicinal compounds
from somebody's plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody will say, oh, it's medicine,
you should control it and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, there's a lot of companies now
that have very consistent medicine batch
[SPEAKER_00]: to batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I test the bottles batch to batch,
I see they're very similar, and I can use
[SPEAKER_00]: those as medicine because I'm following
the patients closely and I see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is doing for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to know what each cannabinoid
can do, and then you have to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what happens when they kind of
work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I had to kind
of come around to as a scientist was that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is always going to be some small
level of unknown when you're using whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that somebody might be sensitive to
something else that's in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it doesn't fit them or suit them,
we sometimes try different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we try to narrow in on maybe this
did work for you and this didn't work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this bottle have that this
bottle doesn't have?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you try to be scientific about it and
try to narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But studies show that whole plant seems to
have higher efficacy than isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I like that response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very diplomatic that, you know,
we know that that we get a lot of benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the whole plant, but there still is
very much a need to be studying the
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that is a nice balance between
the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I'm curious when in just in your
approach in treating patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there a certain sort of blend of
cannabinoids and terpenes that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: found?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be most effective or that you deploy in
certain situations?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you sort of go about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a loaded question, because like
I get a lot of families or people that ask
[SPEAKER_00]: me which what's the best CBG?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is the best medicine is the
one that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be different for you than it is
for me, even though we have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because what we're trying to do
is take a plant that has over 500
[SPEAKER_00]: different compounds i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: a very complex product of mother nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to match it to your
extremely complex physiology and a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, let's say, chemovar chemical
variety of plant, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, which I try not to use that word
because it's not really accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word is chemovar chemical variety of
plant that works for your arthritis may
[SPEAKER_00]: not work for my arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because again, your DNA is different
from my DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your response, your absorption,
the way you metabolize, the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: excrete chemicals from your body is very
different from the way that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever talked to someone who has
been successful using cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll tell you, I had to try a number of
products to really narrow down on what
[SPEAKER_00]: worked for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Parkinson's is a neurodegenerative
disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beginning of Parkinson's,
the course of illness, is different than
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle, than the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when somebody says to me, what do you
use for Parkinson's?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, where is the person in
their course, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they just diagnosed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they 10 years in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they 20 years in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are their most symptoms that they're
trying to address?
[SPEAKER_00]: How old are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they tolerate THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they not want THC in their mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much to determining what works
for somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you can't necessarily just
walk into a dispensary and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I have X disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I take?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody hands you and says,
oh, use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get lucky and it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it doesn't work, you must
understand that this is not cookie cutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ratio should my child be on for
epilepsy?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no one size fits all for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely ridiculous to think that
this complex plant and your complex
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology is going to be, you know,
as they say, one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just does not work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I imagine that's got to be
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there certain traits, certain markers
that you commonly see to know that,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I imagine that this person might
benefit from linalool or any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: particular terpenes or cannabinoids that
you've just sort of gathered in your
[SPEAKER_01]: experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a child with autism,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know autism is a condition where the
brain is overly excited, what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroexcitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brain is overly excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happening is you're getting
neurotransmitters, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemical messengers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neurotransmitters in your brain are
sending messages that aren't always
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive and correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're trying to tell those
neurotransmitters, you know, dial it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the analogy like someone who many of
the kids with autism are just a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: parents will acknowledge this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Ferrari flying down the freeway
with no brakes.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't want to stop the Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want is a Ferrari to go speed
limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to just balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, neuroexcitation is out of
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an out of balance message.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a bear is chasing you, yes,
you want your brain to be overexcited,
[SPEAKER_00]: fight or flight, but not in just everyday
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of those kids have been shown to
respond to the calming terpenes like
[SPEAKER_00]: linalool, the anti-inflammatory terpenes
like beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a terpene pinene, which can help
with focus and concentration and learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people find that to be very
helpful for their child with autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, ultimately, what we're trying to do
is take this really large amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: products that are out there and narrow
them down to fit that specific person that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're treating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can start with using our knowledge
about these compounds to say, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, this is what doctors are
doing all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you came in to my office, let's say if
I was a regular doctor practicing
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, I have a handful of tools in my
toolbox, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using my knowledge, my clinical
experience, the research, and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make the best educated guess
that I can make, let me pick this drug and
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I'm going to get lucky and
it's going to be the perfect match and the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to say, wow, my doctor
was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knew exactly what to give to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes, by the way, which has
happened to me, you take one dose and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no way in hell I'm taking another
dose of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you call your doctor and say,
oh, my gosh, you know, like I'm thinking I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to go to the ER after I took that
pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on the end of that once in my
life and that once was enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember calling the doctor and the
doctor on call was not my doctor who said,
[SPEAKER_00]: gee, I wonder why he started with that
one, which did not instill any confidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you're you're making
the best guess you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until somebody takes something,
you just do not know how they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of cannabis is that you're not
going to be harmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it's got a lot of THC and you have
an unpleasant like, you know, THC overdose
[SPEAKER_00]: experience where you get too intoxicated
and you get paranoid and anxious and freak
[SPEAKER_00]: out a little, you still won't die from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're probably not going to end up in
an ER if you get some reassurance that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be fine and it's going to
wear off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is cannabis is
extremely safe to trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for many of my patients, the reason
I'm able to help them is they're willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to hang in there with me as we
methodically approach a trial and error
[SPEAKER_00]: way of doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, again, look, there was a study
out of Israel that took 60 kids with
[SPEAKER_00]: severe behavioral issues as part of their
autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 50 percent of them responded,
basically 50 percent responded to a 20 to
[SPEAKER_00]: one ratio CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what about the other 50 percent?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a crap shoot,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other the other 50 percent,
about half of them, a little slightly more
[SPEAKER_00]: than half responded to adding in a little
more THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often that's the approach is let's
start with this and then we can add
[SPEAKER_00]: something in if your child looks like it's
not going to your child's not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that's in that responder category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody using cannabis for a serious
illness has to kind of accept the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell everybody, you must be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must understand that probably for the
first three to six months, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may get very lucky and the first
product out of the out of the gate helps
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes that's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hanging in there and just getting
some good advice and trialing things is is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's par for the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what about delivery method?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you saying bottles a lot is a lot
of oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tinctures that you're recommending.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons is because you can
really control the dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you buy an edible, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say the edible has got 10
milligrams and you cut it into,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, a little piece of, I don't
know, a chocolate and you cut it into four
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces, you can go as low as two point
five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe you could cut that piece
again in half and get a low dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with oils, I can measure out a half a
milligram of THC, which can be medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to titrate what we
call titrate dosing, to be able to start
[SPEAKER_00]: with very tiny doses and go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you bought THC capsules and they
only come in 25 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your dose, you figured out somehow
that your dose is 15 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the capsule comes as 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you taking 15?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find that especially initially,
again, if we can get the dose right,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can look at what products allow
for that dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, inhaling is not something
that we do a lot with pediatric patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some parents using like a type
of vaporizer where it has a bag and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you can put a little mask over the child's
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for some kids who have severe rage and
aggression as part of their syndrome or
[SPEAKER_00]: part of autism or whatever it is they
have, they are using that vape in those
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really medicating by that
because the other thing with children is
[SPEAKER_00]: that children grow and you have to be able
to increase the dose based on their weight
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't want them to outgrow the
dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very typical for any medicine and
pediatrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most medicines are based on weight in the
pediatric world.
[SPEAKER_00]: For adults, though, I find that having
liquids that you can titrate a quarter of
[SPEAKER_00]: a dropper to a half a dropper,
for instance, 0.25 milligrams to 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: If 0.5 is too much and 0.25 is not enough,
you can use a little syringe to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: out 0.3 or 0.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just allows you to kind of really
narrow in on dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everybody need that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just some people need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody needs it, but I do like
tinctures for that particular reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing with tinctures is that you
can hide the flavor in food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually buy empty capsules and
make your own capsules so that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't find the dose you're looking for,
you can make your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just allows for a lot of it's very
easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, edibles are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vaporizers, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all in board with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also encourage people to use topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no, again, no delivery method
that is better than any other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think as a physician who's trying
to dial in dosing for people and to find
[SPEAKER_00]: that sweet spot, especially in a
population of children who are growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: changing who sometimes they're non-verbal
and you don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to make changes
simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're coming up on the end here,
but I did want to ask you, do you have any
[SPEAKER_01]: idea how many physicians out there are
like you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not like you because there's no one
like you, Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but pediatric clinicians who are
actually treating children with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: are there a lot of them out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does one find one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of cannabis doctors that
will treat children who may not have had
[SPEAKER_00]: specific training with pediatrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that because cannabis is so
safe that they're not going to harm
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whether or not they understand the
nuances of treating a child, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: after working with children for so many
years, there's definitely some nuances
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not just a small adult,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's probably less than 10
of us in the whole country that are
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically pediatric trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of a handful on the East Coast or a
few on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of a doctor in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a couple in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there may be others and not
to discount them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's really not very
many of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of it is that it's still
considered controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently gave grand rounds at a local
children's hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the doctor who introduced me said,
you know, this is very controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, I've been doing this for so
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, it's not controversial at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Children have an endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some understanding that there's
dysregulation or deficiency within that
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system for sure with
epilepsy, autism, maybe with ADHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That research is being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other countries, and you would never
leave a child with a deficiency of any
[SPEAKER_00]: other necessary chemical in their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you would like what do we call
insulin deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like type one diabetes is an insulin
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we give those people?
[SPEAKER_00]: We give them insulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a thyroid deficiency,
you have what's called hypothyroidism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now know that children with autism
based on two studies, one out of Stanford
[SPEAKER_00]: University and one out of his real show
that children with autism have low levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of their natural, what we call
endocannabinoid, their inner cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, which serve a protective role
of regulating the brain chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here now we have a population of kids
who have dysregulated behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their brain chemistry, not
balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't we fix the imbalance right
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying more research isn't needed,
but I've treated so many patients and when
[SPEAKER_00]: parents say my child can go back to
school, the aggression is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are no longer living in fear of our 10
year old.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at downside, I always
say, I point to the patients, ask the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will tell you whether or not they're
seeing side effects and all of that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, it's not controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, this is again, just another
tool in the toolbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are smart enough to understand
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're smart enough to do the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we should continue to move
forward till we understand more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not, you know, there's why,
and many people say, why is there a ban on
[SPEAKER_00]: research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, ultimately it comes down to money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason cannabis is being kept as
a schedule one is because it can replace
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that doesn't help the
pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point being that what is everybody
afraid of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just do the research so we can
finally know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when somebody comes to me and says,
is cannabis going to help my child with
[SPEAKER_00]: this rare syndrome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it be nice if I could tell them
whether or not they should spend their
[SPEAKER_00]: money on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't realize the number of
pediatric clinicians using cannabis was so
[SPEAKER_01]: low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is your advice to parents who
maybe have a child they think could
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't have access to to one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do they start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so some of us do educational
consults where we're just educating the
[SPEAKER_00]: parent on kind of where to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some resources online.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a website that it's a nonprofit
that I work with them on their advisory
[SPEAKER_00]: board called Whole Plan Access for Autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's WPA4A.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a project CBD.org that's a
nonprofit that people can turn to to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a referral or, you know,
find a doctor that's cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, we're moving in the right
direction and there are more doctors that
[SPEAKER_00]: are learning about this and are starting
to incorporate it into their practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least we're moving in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you may have to seek out somebody
who's able to do a telemedicine
[SPEAKER_00]: consultation if you can't find somebody in
your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, you should always just
take a look online and see if you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure what your state allows for so that
you're not getting into trouble,
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that you are following the
rules, because certainly we don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody's child getting taken away for
trying cannabis or using cannabis when the
[SPEAKER_00]: state laws don't allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we should have a federal leadership
on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, it's state by state what
you're allowed to give your child.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for those resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely put some links in the show
notes so people can check those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know we're coming up on the end here,
and I did want to talk about CanMed,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what brought us here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And correct me if I'm wrong, but you've
been at all the CanMeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been with us each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're so happy to have you as a
keynote presenter at this year's event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you might want to give
us a little preview of what you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be presenting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm just sharing my findings and
kind of going over what the latest
[SPEAKER_00]: research is in terms of pediatrics and how
my patients are responding to various
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's focused on THC and CBD,
and certainly I focus on those two,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's other cannabinoids that we are
using, CBG, THCA, CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now just coming out on the market in
California are THCV,
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrahydrocannabivarin, and CBDV,
cannabidivarin, which all have,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, their own medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important for people to
understand that there is not just one way
[SPEAKER_00]: or one ratio or one product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different compounds that we
can use therapeutically to address
[SPEAKER_00]: illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this goes back to, right,
if you're not a big responder to just CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC combination, is there something else
that the plant offers that you can try?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for every patient of mine that does
well on CBD or THC, there's those that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even take those cannabinoids and
they're using other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'll be talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten the talk together yet,
so sometimes it takes you to other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly what's fascinating too is
that between now, April and September,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the conference is, there's new data
and new research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes I'm literally putting
together something a week before that is
[SPEAKER_00]: new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very exciting time to be in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the person on the team who usually
has to put the slides together and get
[SPEAKER_01]: everything ready for the production team,
you're not the only one who waits until
[SPEAKER_01]: you get your presentation together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do try to get it in early, but you get
sometimes these wonderful cases or good
[SPEAKER_00]: results or even groundbreaking research
that just gets published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to include it because you
want to keep people on the, you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting edge and leading edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to, in this crazy world of
cannabis, I joke around that like one year
[SPEAKER_00]: is equal to like seven dog years,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's so much that you,
so many things change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's such an active area
research all around the world that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to really stay on top of it in order
to be able to have the latest and
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we love having this event
every year so we can get the latest and
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest and get everyone together to
share their information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we love having you a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we go, is there any other,
any other information you want to share in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of how people can either get in
touch with you or follow what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, whether it be website, social
media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Kana Centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you can look for Kana hyphen
centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have an Instagram, which is
Bonnie Goldstein MD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't over post.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to put things on Facebook that
are good articles that I come across in
[SPEAKER_00]: the scientific literature that I think
should get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's this finding that it
takes 17 years for article scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: information to trickle down to doctors,
which is like blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, but remember, if you're a busy
practice, you're taking care of patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're taking care of your business and
you're, you're, you know, you're deep in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very hard to keep up with the
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try really hard to make sure I post
articles that are again, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: latest information that can be helpful to
people and it's meaningful to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on Instagram, I just often share
stories of my patients or reposts of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who are getting success because
people, we are fighting also propaganda
[SPEAKER_00]: and fear of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what people need to realize is that
under medical supervision, cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I joke around that I'm a chicken inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I am a very conservative doctor
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me to be able to feel comfortable
with cannabis, I will tell you it is
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: My elderly parents take cannabis for their
conditions and I would never let them take
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that I would think would harm
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly wouldn't recommend
cannabis to children if it wasn't safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think people need to realize
that this kind of party line we were dealt
[SPEAKER_00]: with, we were handed a long time ago that,
oh, it's dangerous and it kills brain
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and it's going to do all these
terrible things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just baloney.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great way to close it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining us, Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoy my conversation with
Bonnie Goldstein.

one of the largest testing labs in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We discuss the importance of safety
testing, challenges that come with
[SPEAKER_01]: navigating regulations, the recent vaping
crisis, and more.
