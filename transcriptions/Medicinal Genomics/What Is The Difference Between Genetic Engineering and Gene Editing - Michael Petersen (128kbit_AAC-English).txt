[SPEAKER_00]: of like, what is genetic engineering?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is gene editing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of, you know, clarify those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so genetic engineering is,
I guess, is kind of defined as moving a
[SPEAKER_01]: gene from one species to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, maybe if I give an
example, so back in the mid to late 80s,
[SPEAKER_01]: the papaya plant, was basically being
decimated by a virus called ringspot,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the Hawaiian plantations were being
devastated at the time, and they couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: breed in a good resistant or bring in a
good resistant line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the University of Hawaii and Cornell,
I believe, identified a gene not from
[SPEAKER_01]: papaya, but a gene that would be resistant
to the papaya plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The papaya ringspot virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they put that gene, and this was
actually with a gene gun, they put that
[SPEAKER_01]: gene into a papaya plant and found out
that yes, indeed, that plant was
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant, fully resistant to the ringspot
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, since that gene didn't come from
papaya, that's an example of a GMO or a
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically modified organism,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, you know, I don't know if you,
you knew or people, most people don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, most of the papaya plants
that we've been eating since the late 80s
[SPEAKER_01]: are GMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, you know, that one particular
gene that gives it resistance to that
[SPEAKER_01]: papaya disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another example, maybe, you know,
is a purple tomato that came out recently
[SPEAKER_01]: last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came out with a purple tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another genetically modified
tomato that was made through agrobacterium
[SPEAKER_01]: transformation, but it just put basically
in genes that were anthocyanin genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're making purple tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the flip side, gene editing is a
little different because now you're
[SPEAKER_01]: basically just removing a little bit of
sequence or adding sequence that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: there into the existing cannabis plant
from its own genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not bringing in an external
gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just either, you know, cutting it
and deleting a few bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or bringing in a gene that's in cannabis
already to give it a different trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the main distinction then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Engineering, introducing genes from a
different plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Editing is just editing the existing
genome in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess a way to look at it is the way
that I guess the FDA or USDA look at it is
[SPEAKER_01]: if the plant can be made by normal
breeding, because through normal breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when you take two plants,
two cannabis plants together and breed
[SPEAKER_01]: them, there's going to be a lot of
shuffling of different genes and amongst,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, amongst their genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's, if it's something you can make
through normal breeding, which editing is
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're just, you know,
taking out or adding a few bases of its
[SPEAKER_01]: own genome, then they consider that
editing and yeah.
Okay.
