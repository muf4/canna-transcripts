[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my name is Iney Afia,
Chief Science Officer at CannaSafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we'll be talking a little bit about
DCC standardization and how to prepare for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really tailored towards
analytical labs, but it does affect
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in October of 2021, California
Senate passed SB 544 that was essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: about standardization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me see, my eyesight's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much what SB 544 was meant to
implement provisions of the Marijuana Act
[SPEAKER_00]: that required the DCC on or before January
1st of next year to implement some
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized test methods that the labs
can use in order to test the potency of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposed to be one or more and it
should be, it can be developed through a
[SPEAKER_00]: reference test lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we'll talk about what that really
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the bill, there's six cannabinoids
listed, THC, CHCBD, CBG, CBDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, I should probably stick around
here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to wander a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it talks about about six cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concern for some of folks is what does
this really mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is standardization?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that the bill only lists six
cannabinoids, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we gonna be restricted to only testing
six cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: And question is, will they really involve
reference labs or the current California
[SPEAKER_00]: testing labs?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, there are over 40,
46, I believe, or more of them currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it involve some NIST studies?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of labs here, if labs here,
you'll know that there were a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: studies performed through NIST,
about three of them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the question can be asked since,
is standardization really a fool's errand,
[SPEAKER_00]: given the inherent variability of testing
or cannabinoids in the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that your potency can differ from
different flowers from different parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, from the top larger buds to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, what are we standardizing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it stifle innovation?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a free market, and currently,
each lab validates and tests its own test
[SPEAKER_00]: method for potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case anybody asks what is a test
method, when you take your sample to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, they stick it on an instrument,
usually an HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them to be able to run it,
they have to develop and test a method,
[SPEAKER_00]: and validate a method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a test method I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The method that they use to essentially
provide your THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that validation, they essentially are
able to address certain things,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain parameters that the DCC set forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, we need clarification of that bill
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: What exactly is to be standardized?
[SPEAKER_00]: DCC says you have to validate your method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're validating and looking for
accuracy, linearity, range, reproducibly,
[SPEAKER_00]: robustness, LOD, LOQs, which are a big
topic, and specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What exactly is to be standardized?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about, is it the instrument
method, as I just mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: The instrument method essentially is what
is run on the instrument you're generally
[SPEAKER_00]: using, which is an HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you standardize the mobile phases that
are being used, the detector type that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being used?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask me later if you have questions
about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: What those really mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the column that's being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important, the sample prep method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that sample even gets on an
instrument, how do you prepare it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you dissolve it in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What solvents do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the homogenization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably most importantly, the
homogenization.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you really homogenize that sample
you're using that you're about to test?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not just about flour,
or even oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And homogenization essentially means
mixing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think I need to explain
homogenization, but what are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: A cryomill, as in terms of liquid
nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you simply blending the products?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the matrix considerations?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry is one of those
industries where you can essentially test
[SPEAKER_00]: anything in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen so much that every day I used to
be amazed in terms of I've tested
[SPEAKER_00]: toothpicks, candles, even whole
mattresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks are making mattresses infused with
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: How useful that is, I don't know,
but it's pretty exciting and pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sample matrix considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, I just talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this myriad of products that are
infused with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you really standardize testing
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that what we need to focus on in
terms of standardization rather than the
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument test method?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a thought about the use of
compendium methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know folks like AOAC, AACM,
USP are working on, or do have currently
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized test methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we follow one of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should the DC think about going through
one of those rather than developing a new
[SPEAKER_00]: test method that is required of the lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: This question is, does it create
monopolies for instrument or consumable
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Valid concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, when you're creating a test
method, I think when you're standardizing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, there's the general thought that you
are not designating specific vendor part
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, for instance, a column,
you wouldn't say, oh, the test method must
[SPEAKER_00]: only use a Restec C18 Raptor column.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, there's nomenclature like a USP
L1 column that designates a C18 column.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume things like that will be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what happens when there
is no standardization.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really why this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally the slippery slope of lab
shopping, which I'll show some data about.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I noted, what happens when a lot of
things are happening around lab shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is is a client has a batch of
flour, and obviously, they want to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell it for the highest value that they
can sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 48 or so labs in California,
and you're going to use as many of them as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to see how they compare,
who's giving you the appropriate or
[SPEAKER_00]: desired value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not accusing anybody of doing
anything unscrupulous here, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to want to get your best result.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking it to different labs,
and they're giving you different numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you generally will go with the highest
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's not done on a compliance
COA, because you can only run that one
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get an R&D test, and then you like
them, you rerun it as a compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that happens, essentially,
the consumer loses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not necessarily that all labs are
falsifying results, but if they happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, you're giving a falsely high
potency value, for instance, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer loses because they go to
dispensary, and they're paying much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: for a product that may not necessarily be
the number that is stated that it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even more importantly, false negative
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only focusing on potency,
but think about the contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be paying for something that
should have failed for mold and yeast or
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into health concerns and the
general public that the buyers and
[SPEAKER_00]: distributors lose because they may pay
more for potentially inflated results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many times I've seen this
where distributor buys batch of product
[SPEAKER_00]: from someone and retests at my lab,
and the value is drastically different,
[SPEAKER_00]: generally lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would ask, well, what happened here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, sometimes it's higher,
but we'll get into why that may be the
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a loss for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulators lose control.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you have labs just giving all sorts of
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, arguments can be made around
why these are different, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about flour, but when we're
talking about a more homogenized matrix
[SPEAKER_00]: like an oil, a vape product, it should be
a little more stable in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the labs lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: With inflation happening, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty much the only industry where
everything's going up, but our prices are
[SPEAKER_00]: going down because of the competition
fighting amongst ourselves to get
[SPEAKER_00]: clientele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your vegetables at the supermarket are
going up, but yet our test costs are going
[SPEAKER_00]: down, and the consumables that we're
buying are going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you keep up with consumable prices
going up or your test costs going down?
[SPEAKER_00]: This explains why labs are going out of
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Employees end up losing when this happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs shut down and they end up maybe on
unemployment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxpayers lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Employment increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to note the timer is not going,
so in case I do go over my time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at some comparative form data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of data around that we've
gathered, but I chose to go off of this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice set just to give you a little
glimpse into what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the most recent NIST results that
came out, the variability amongst it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is comparative data from a client
that sent samples to labs, about eight
[SPEAKER_00]: labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a well-done study where you have a
nice, homogenized set of flour in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, and when I say clean, it's generally
there were no contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on potency on this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They send this clean, homogenized flour,
essentially ground up finely, to about
[SPEAKER_00]: eight labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see, starting with TERPs,
just look at the relative standard
[SPEAKER_00]: deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there was one lab that had a
TERP content of 3.78%, which is quite rare
[SPEAKER_00]: in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an outlier, kind of sticks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: On a ground flour that was sent to you,
you still got 3.78%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that result is false.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see the congruency amongst the
other lab data and total THC, about 21%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture was relatively stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go for under 10% RSD,
but that wasn't the case here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparatively, this was a whole set of
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was ground up, and the other was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole buds were sent, and it was
determined or it was set that the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes were generally about the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can discount the thought that,
well, it could have been different bud
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes and what not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice what happens here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the increase in total THC,
the mean value of the same cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: from 21.6 to about 28.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite the jump from the same flour,
same products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture stayed relatively the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total TERPs increased a little bit,
relatively the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice how there was about a 32% increase
in that mean potency value, but
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically lab seven had a 13 point
jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 59% increase in their total THC
from the flour that was homogenized,
[SPEAKER_00]: one that was not of the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody generally went up when the flour
was not homogenized and it was sent to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, you'll see that even the
non-homogenized flour, the RSD,
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually lower than the homogenized
one, about 11%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was around the same,
but much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where things get a little
tricky here when labs are doing their own
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can note that homogenization is
usually the key here to these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you think, as a distributor,
you get a lot more money for a second data
[SPEAKER_00]: set, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at contaminants this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same vendor or client sent the same
thing again, focusing on contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, she spiked it with aspergillus
for the same lab sets to do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contaminated homogenized flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not focus on the potency,
but you could see TERPs again,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of funky all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture, and now the labs knew a little
bit more what was happening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's coming from the same vendor
and you can see that the potency is
[SPEAKER_00]: generally higher when they know what the
client expects, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But look how many labs sort of failed or I
should say were accurate for detecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus, which was well done again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was well spiked and it was made
homogenously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sent in by a microbiologist,
so she knew what she was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a 62% accuracy in detecting
aspergillus, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you'll see what's happening
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you look at a 62% accuracy in
detecting aspergillus, that's concerning,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So product that's out there, does it have
the same rate of accuracy in detecting
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus?
[SPEAKER_00]: When the flour was not homogenized,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Only two labs got it right, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it was well done, but this time it
was not ground up flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not homogenized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that how it would
normally be sent to the lab would be not
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenized, you know, whole but.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now only two labs got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really interesting and really,
really scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forget about the potency lab shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we talk about public health,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Public safety and contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to know that some of these
labs, I think at least one, use a plate to
[SPEAKER_00]: plate for aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a whole lot that could
go down a rabbit hole around why that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't probably appropriate, but that was
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may note that one lab noted two
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there could be some cross
hybridization things happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the point is that they detected and
failed the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: But only two labs got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, my lab's one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a solution to all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, you know, there are solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Need to increase oversight of cannabis
testing labs and their methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I implore DCC to really step up their game
in the oversight, especially in knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what to look for when they're
auditing laboratories and the test methods
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should perform on scheduled blind round
robins.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, you'll note that if a
state or some kind of regulator wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: send a blind round robin through a lab,
everybody knows what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, the numbers will be congruent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, hey, what's the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do on schedule where they don't
know that it's sent by the state or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot, you'll see maybe a little bit of
truth around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all labs are required to perform
proficiency testing and they all do and
[SPEAKER_00]: they all pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, they wouldn't keep their
license or be able to test for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, when you are taking a
proficiency test, you know exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing and you're going to do things
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's thought of maybe the producers and
cultivators should test in-house,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, as a lab, I don't necessarily
want that, but I don't necessarily mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, there's a lot to be
considered when you're trying to have them
[SPEAKER_00]: test in-house and knowing what to be
expected before they send it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a cultivator or distributor says,
why is this 30%?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were testing in-house and they
already know that's not 30%, they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: blame the lab for not reaching that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They would at least know what they're
starting out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly is to solidify the category
one pesticide limits of detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, the state essentially allows
labs to set their own LODs, especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: category one, based on their method and
instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cap, right, 0.1 ppm,
but the labs are able to push that limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the instruments can detect a lot
lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to see from 2018,
starting out here in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the labs, their LODs, everybody was going
for as low as possible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be able to catch everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the years go by, you keep on seeing
people's COAs creeping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, we used to go at 0.0,
0.01 to 0.008, and it just keeps creeping
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now everybody's pushing 0.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hey, the state allows it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not take advantage of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can push the limit of the limit of
detection, essentially not failing as many
[SPEAKER_00]: people for those category one
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, those category one
contaminants are ones that you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, they're banned, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a residue limit that is
expected for labs to be able to reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could place limits on THC content,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So recent Mississippi rules is now placing
limits on, well, if it sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the initial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making flowers fell at 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's thought about how much can
the flower really, how much THC can the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower really produce biologically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it really make 30% of its use?
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% of its mass is only THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about all the other compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're getting above 30%,
is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's considerations like
we're testing by dry weight, meaning if
[SPEAKER_00]: you test flower, you test as is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a 20% flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dry it down, and it's really 10%
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially adding, it's not apples for
apples, but essentially you're adding 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: more to that final number, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20% becomes like a 22 or so,
because you have to test by dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, if you're in Mississippi,
well, forget about growing anything good,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at 27, 30, you're off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're adding in all the THC variants
into the total THC calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's thought, should we place
limits on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also doing 60% for tinctures and
oils and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should that be the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that this should be the
case at all, but it's to be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, eventually there'll be
federal oversight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that will really mitigate some
of this unscrupulous activities that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens when you have federal oversight of
these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been in the pharmaceutical
industry for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to nutraceutical and
finally cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of interesting to see the shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, when I came into the cannabis
industry and at local site, I had to I was
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in with the pharmaceutical mindset
of really strict regulations and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that didn't really apply in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to step back and relax myself and go
with the actual rules, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't implement rules that are not being
regulated by the regulatory body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when there's federal oversight,
you better believe there's gonna be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: stricter rules around this and all these,
you know, lab shopping will essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: cease to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there will always be folks out there
that can do what they want, but I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll cease to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can labs really prepare for
standardization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, luckily, SB 544 now allows DCC
authority to set regulations for the list
[SPEAKER_00]: of contaminants and their respective
action levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as much as we'd like them to change
things, some things can not be changed
[SPEAKER_00]: that easily because you have to go through
the regulatory red tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has signed off, the governor,
all of the above, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that the Department of Cannabis
Control will have that authority,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be able to hopefully make
effective change a lot more quickly as to
[SPEAKER_00]: the contaminant list, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there'll be a talk here about
increasing those contaminant lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, where were all you guys before?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll be able to set that contaminant
list and it'll make things a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to speak directly to them
and hopefully we'll be able to see
[SPEAKER_00]: effective change when they're able to have
that power to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you should ensure that your
instruments meet the sensitivity
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements that will probably change,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So labs set up with different instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was speaking of somebody using plates
for aspergillus, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that will cease to exist because
unless you have the appropriate staff and
[SPEAKER_00]: the appropriate methodologies to really
speciate aspergillus on plates,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably shouldn't be using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be molecular methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should start validating to compendium
methods, AOAC, SMPR, ACM, USP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start validating to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your validation is robust so
that whatever the state does come up with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll probably meet it to begin with,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting because I doubt the state
will really force anybody into a method,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, just speculating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still learning what they're gonna do
or what we're waiting to know what exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: they will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should run proficiency tests in the
cannabis matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is important for the
proficiency PT providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the industry has really grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, everything used to be
insolvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can take anything insolvent,
shoot it, it looks great forever until you
[SPEAKER_00]: run it in matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, the initial data that used to
come from some of the industry folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was all insolvent and that you'd run it
day to day in your instrument,
[SPEAKER_00]: on your column and find out it's not
robust, it doesn't last because this
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't done in matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do this in matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say enough how complicated and
complex the cannabis matrix is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It throws a lot of curve balls when you're
trying to validate in matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make sure that you're doing things
right, you should run your proficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: tests in matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means it should be supplied in a
cannabis matrix or at least a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: similar matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you know that your methods are
robust and you're actually getting
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate values.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should evaluate your homogenization
methods for consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got a key point here for
folks who are taking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, homogenization is key to some of
these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking at gummies and you
get, you know, 10 packs of 20 count
[SPEAKER_00]: gummies, so you have a couple hundred of
them and you're supposed to homogenize
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you really do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the rules kind of leave it open,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say, oh, open all the bags and
throw them together, shake them up,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's homogenization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, others melt it down,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's homogenized, others cryo-grind it
with liquid nitrogen to find powder,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's homogenized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this needs to be standardized in order
to be able to effectively make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evaluate the CRM vendors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certified reference material vendors and
stability of mixed components.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say how much, many times I've been
able to kind of prove CRM vendors wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: that their mixture was not stable,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not trying to boast out there,
but there are, when you're trying to put
[SPEAKER_00]: all these components into one vial and
say, oh, this will last for two years,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, generally, they found that it
doesn't, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the industry has matured and they
found they need to separate some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds as they do not mix well and
remain stable in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ready to run and maintain multiple
methods and instrument methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: because chances are, a lot of you are
already doing it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of labs are already running and
maintaining multiple methods, so just,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the DCC does require that you will be
using that, you're probably going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to run multiple methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, right on time, I'd like to
take some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm short here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much and thank you for the
hard work that you do with DCC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of questions for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is, my understanding is that DCC
requires laboratories to be ISO
[SPEAKER_02]: accredited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How familiar is DCC with ISO 17025?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, honestly, a lot of the
regulators, the members of the DCC did
[SPEAKER_00]: come from environmental side and
pharmaceutical, so they should be very
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with it and they do require that
accreditation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly, whenever an audit
happens, usually they're not touching on
[SPEAKER_00]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would expect them to touch more on
that side of that accreditation,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the required accreditation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made a couple of comments that I'm
hoping you can clarify for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is you said all methods need to be
validated.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, you said that all in-house methods
for potency are in-house methods that the
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory has to validate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later in your presentation,
you mentioned that a standard test method
[SPEAKER_02]: could be used, a compendial method such as
AOAC, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering and help me understand
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a laboratory is using a standardized
compendial method, let's say something
[SPEAKER_02]: from, I think you quoted USP or AOAC,
whatever, do you allow the laboratories in
[SPEAKER_02]: California to verify their ability to meet
the standard compendial method
[SPEAKER_02]: requirements or do you which is required
by ISO 17-025?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you require the laboratories to
ignore that part of 17-025 and require
[SPEAKER_02]: them to validate even a standardized
compendial test method?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part one of my question and part
two of my question is if at some point
[SPEAKER_02]: they make a minor change to one of their
methods, let's say they're moving from a
[SPEAKER_02]: 20-gram or 20-milligram sample size to a
18-milligram sample size, do you require
[SPEAKER_02]: them to go through the whole validation
process all over again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not the DCC, but very important and
a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, this really revolves around
standard operating procedures,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're running a compendial method,
you should at minimum verify that in your
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory on your instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not required to do a full validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I say that because the DCC has done it
several ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where in the microbial section,
they require full validation regardless,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring it in-house, you do a full
validation, but on the more chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: methods, it's been at minimum
verification.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important in your SOPs because per
ISO regulations, I mean, ISO is really
[SPEAKER_00]: about doing what you say you're doing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you write in your SOPs that I will
only be verifying compendial methods for
[SPEAKER_00]: these certain parameters, you should do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really how it should be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be really no need to
revalidate in its entirety a compendial
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since a lot of that work was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, yeah, it would be based on your SOP
and you should revalidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should do that based on your SOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do change a parameter of the
method, that's a compendial method,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, those parameters could be based on
your SOPs, but we all know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you should revalidate the entire
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the method calls for a certain column,
a C18, 45 millimeter length or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you change it to, I don't know,
hydrophilic column, that's a whole new,
[SPEAKER_00]: revalidation because you're not following
the compendial method.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question, if I may.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is around your CRMs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So certified reference material,
I believe those are accredited also to an
[SPEAKER_02]: ISO standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the DCC require the laboratory to
establish the shelf life of those
[SPEAKER_02]: standards once they've been cracked open?
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really should, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vendors, yeah, they do validate
this, but they haven't done any shelf life
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, at least long term anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're starting to now or they
some have already, but generally I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not testing stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I've seen them do it in the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They introduce a product out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good when produced and then they're
doing a study concurrently.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few months later you get this amendment
of a COA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we found out that this is no longer
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to get the product out there
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the difference is that the CRM
comes with an expiration date on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could be for five years or two
years or whatever, but that expiration
[SPEAKER_02]: date is null and voided as soon as the
vial is cracked open.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I get a standard today and it
expires in five years, let's say it
[SPEAKER_02]: expires in 2027, as soon as I open it,
the CRM provider has absolutely no way to
[SPEAKER_02]: develop or know what that shelf life is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That ownership is on the laboratory,
not on the vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is on the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these things that happen that
you may suspect is unscrupulous is really
[SPEAKER_00]: just negligence, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're calibrating and you have some
old THC standard that's mixed and open,
[SPEAKER_00]: stored in your freezer, that THC is
converting to THC over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're inflating your THC value
and deflating your THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how that can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, the onus is on the lab to make
sure that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that responsibility shifts to the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not on the CRM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do expect that the CRM vendor will
at least make some sort of, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there'd be some responsibility for at
least limiting that, knowing that this
[SPEAKER_00]: will be open and used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it should be a shared
responsibility, but that's just my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a question on the RPD that's allowed
by the state for every single method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's plus or minus 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At part per trillion levels, that's
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: At percent levels, it's a disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody that's plus or minus 30% on
their potency numbers is well within the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations of the DCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, if they are going to
be coming up with certified or reference
[SPEAKER_01]: methods, could that be tightened to in any
way?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would you see as an acceptable
RPD for potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic question, Art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the RPD is super wide,
you know, 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you don't know the expected
results of the generally potency ones,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's in a PT, yeah, PT are even
wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could pass them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could drive a truck through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have to tighten that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the lab, I expect around 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I guess you work around
measurement uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know what your measurement
uncertainty for your analytes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, those do need to be tightened
because you can't have 30% that wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just, you know, it could be
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody will pass regardless,
you know, between 15% to 30% of expected
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That still passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I expect that will be tightened as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
