[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering if you could kind of
just like take me through the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: creating a new strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like are you selecting the plants with a
specific trait in mind or are you just
[SPEAKER_01]: taking two plants crossing them and kind
of seeing what comes out and then
[SPEAKER_01]: following the trail from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, each strain is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought back a cut from AK-47 from a
family farm in Durango, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it back and got it initiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then crossed it with a very popular
Michigan strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard of it, Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to create our new strain, which we
called Cream 47, we had to take the Oreos,
[SPEAKER_00]: get it to an F3, and then we took our
AK-47, which we knew is a land race
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, and we did that initial upfront
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do that cross, when creating Cream
47, we had a list of markers we wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to hit high trichome density.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted the bag peel to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted some of that creamy kind of Oreo
flavor to come over from the Oreos in that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, it's doing a stem rub on
the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, we're looking at internodal
spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do we want an indica dominant
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want a sativa dominant plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want a true hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also implementing,
like I said before, which genotypes and
[SPEAKER_00]: which plants are most resistant towards
certain plant pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, it's hard to give a breeder a
rundown of an exact formula for what our
[SPEAKER_00]: targets are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for each strain, we have a
different goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just developed a strain push OG,
which our goal for that was to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: drought resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very drought resistant and to be a
light feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, it's hard to nail down
exactly what we're looking for for each
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bag appeal, because of the way the
market is right now and the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are trending in the industry, bag appeal
is always a box that we have to check
[SPEAKER_00]: because at the end of the day,
the grower needs to like what they see in
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy and the consumer needs to like
what they see in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when you were talking about doing
the initial cross with I think it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: F3 and then the land race and then so how
many different seeds are you popping?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many plants are you sort of evaluating
and sort of how does it scale from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, if we're doing if we're
hunting through seed, we're doing about
[SPEAKER_00]: 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I told you before, we're a small indoor
craft sealed facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in an indoor sealed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, we don't have any worries of any
cross contamination or foreign pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in that we're unaware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for what we were just speaking about,
the F3 and then you're taking the land
[SPEAKER_00]: race AK-47.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we make that cross, we will hunt out
about from maybe 200 seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do that because of the stability
with both lines we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we need is about 200 seed to find that
genotype that we want to then sterilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we use axillary node culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually doing a micro splice
taking that node.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sterilizing it and then getting it into
vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then depending on how quick we need to
make seed for our new line, it might stay
[SPEAKER_00]: there for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might stay there for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're pulling it out when we need
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that upfront stabilization before you
were putting it into tissue culture makes
[SPEAKER_01]: it so you don't have to hunt as many.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
All right.
