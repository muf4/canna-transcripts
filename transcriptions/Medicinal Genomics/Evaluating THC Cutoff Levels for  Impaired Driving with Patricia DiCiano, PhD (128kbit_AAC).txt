[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, just a few reminders before I
introduce this episode's guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, in honor of the holiday season,
we have extended the early bird deadline
[SPEAKER_00]: for CanMed 24 through December 31st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't miss this chance to save hundreds on
your full summit package, which includes
[SPEAKER_00]: access to the medical practicum,
industry workshops, oral presentations,
[SPEAKER_00]: poster presentations, networking events,
meals, and a three-night stay at the JW
[SPEAKER_00]: Marriott Marco Island Resort with all the
associated amenities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, head over to CanMedEvents.com now to
register, and I hope to see you in Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: this May.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to mention that we have
added details about the CanMed 24 full-day
[SPEAKER_00]: medical practicum on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we are thrilled to welcome Dr.
Ethan Rousseau to the practicum faculty,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we look forward to him sharing his
extensive knowledge and experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will be joined by fellow instructors
Dr. Bonnie Goldstein, Dr. Dustin Sulak,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Eloise Thiessen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you aren't familiar with those names,
I invite you to read about them on
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMedEvents.com, and if you are familiar,
then you already know that you can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: any better instructors than this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, go to CanMedEvents.com now to learn
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, I spoke with Dr. Patricia
DiCiano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patricia is a scientist with the Institute
of Mental Health and Policy Research at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Center for Addiction and Mental
Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is also an assistant professor in the
Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology
[SPEAKER_00]: at the University of Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patricia has a multidisciplinary
background, and her general research area
[SPEAKER_00]: is clinical trials and regulated studies
into the safety of cannabis and other
[SPEAKER_00]: substances of abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier this year, she co-authored a study
that evaluated the utility of THC cutoff
[SPEAKER_00]: levels in blood and saliva for the
detection of impaired driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discussed the
different allowable limits for THC levels
[SPEAKER_00]: in drivers, the relationship between THC
levels and impaired driving, the best
[SPEAKER_00]: fluid to test for THC levels, the additive
effects of combining alcohol and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: on driving impairment, the differences in
how alcohol and cannabis affect driving
[SPEAKER_00]: performance, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Patricia, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Trusted Canna Nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trusted Canna Nurse was founded by Megan
Bang and Ariane Williams, two nurses who
[SPEAKER_00]: are dedicated to bridging the gap between
traditional medicine and the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They specialize in creating evidence-based
treatment plans for all ages that address
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic illness, treatment-resistant
conditions, mental health, autism,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at trustedcannanurse.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patricia DiCiano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Patricia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to talk with you today
about cannabis and driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seems to be a topic that comes up
quite often as different jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_00]: loosen their restrictions on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the major concerns from lawmakers,
law enforcement, and the general public is
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we keep impaired drivers off the
road?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times the question is,
is there an equivalent breathalyzer test
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we all know it turns out that
it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you and your team recently published a
new study that looks at this problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm eager to dive into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I'd like to start broadly and
ask, is there data that shows that
[SPEAKER_00]: incidents of impaired driving increase in
states or countries that legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the data, as most things in the field,
is not 100% clear one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say that most of the research has
been done up till a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mostly done in the U.S.,
so looking at states that legalized
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, either for medical reasons a
number of years ago, or more recently for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational purposes, and compare pre and
post, or they compared legal versus
[SPEAKER_01]: non-legal states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are two different ways to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some studies found that the incidence
of impaired driving after cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: driving under the influence of cannabis
went up with legalization, and others
[SPEAKER_01]: found that it went down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others found that it stayed the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually not that clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may ask, why would it go down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would driving under the influence of
cannabis go down after legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three possible explanations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that people with increased access
to cannabis seem to be switching from
[SPEAKER_01]: using alcohol to using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that although cannabis is bad
for driving, it does impair driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as bad as alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps we're seeing fewer arrests
because the driving is still impaired,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not as impaired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there could be more increased
enforcement of driving under the influence
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis in legal states than non-legal
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're picking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more enforcement of it in those
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're joining us from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I understand it, there are
established limits for THC concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: for driving in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those?
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on your research or your
knowledge in the area, do you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that too low, too high?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the legal limits vary by jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some don't have limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others have limits of blood THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC being a psychoactive component of
cannabis that's thought to impair driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5 nanograms per mil seems to be the limit
that most people sort of talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Canada, we have two different
limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is 2 nanograms per mil, which is sort
of the lower level of offense,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then 5 nanograms per mil, which is a
higher level of offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the jurisdictions vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some have a zero tolerance, which has a
zero nanogram per mil threshold,
[SPEAKER_01]: and others have two, others have five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the paper that you have mentioned,
what we looked at was whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a relationship of THC in the blood
to impair driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, one way to deter driving after
the use of cannabis is to look at blood
[SPEAKER_01]: THC and see what the level of blood THC
levels are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a police officer suspects somebody
of being impaired after cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can pull them over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can do a number of roadside tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they can take them back to a lab to
have blood drawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found, which is coming out of
the literature more and more, although
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not, again, it's not 100% one way or
the other, is that as blood THC goes up,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't necessarily see an exact
relationship to changes in driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look at weaving, which is the amount
of departure from a lane, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: measure that's very consistently affected
by cannabis and other drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just how much you deviate when you're
moving in your lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call it weaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scientific term is standard deviation
of lateral position.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at that and tried to see how
that relates to blood THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't see that there was a clear
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as blood THC levels went up,
we didn't necessarily see an exact
[SPEAKER_01]: correspondence of changes in driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people were impaired at higher levels
of blood THC, others weren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't an exact relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we sort of broke it down by the
five nanogram per mil threshold and looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at those who were above versus those who
were below, we found that those two groups
[SPEAKER_01]: were different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there seems to be some merit in those
limits that we do seem to be detecting
[SPEAKER_01]: some measure of impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I have to put the caveat in there
that that was just for smoked cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: we may see differences with edibles or
other routes of administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the concentration goes up,
you don't necessarily see additional
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment, but that five nanogram per mil
or what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Five nanogram per mil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of a clear cutoff that
you're most likely going to be impaired if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now how does that compare with
something that people are probably more
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with, like alcohol?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there more of a linear relationship
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: With blood alcohol, it's more
straightforward because you're measuring
[SPEAKER_01]: more directly sort of vapors that come off
the breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a more clear relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis, you're measuring blood THC,
which gets acted on by enzymes more in a
[SPEAKER_01]: more different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not quite clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That what's in the blood is necessarily
reflecting what's in the brain and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: working in terms of impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: With alcohol, there's more of a clear
relationship between what comes off the
[SPEAKER_01]: breath and what is found in driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a challenge with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to kind of dig into that
because I think there's a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different challenges if I understand
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them being that there's a
number of different fluids that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that your paper kind of looked
at this kind of saliva versus urine versus
[SPEAKER_00]: blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is sort of the best one to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now at the roadside, what
happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in Canada, for sure, I think it's
similar in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is if an officer is suspect somebody of
being impaired, they pull them over and
[SPEAKER_01]: they do a standardized field sobriety
test, which is touching your nose and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the stagness and your ability
to walk in the one leg stand, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your balance and things like that,
which we've all seen on TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we're a little bit familiar with
what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're also able to do at the
roadside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know in Canada, we use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a saliva test that measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you a reading that says positive
or negative if you're above a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: level or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the blood, which they can
take you back to the lab and they can look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Levels of THC as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's urine, of course,
which is a bit of a different beast,
[SPEAKER_01]: because with urine, you're measuring the
breakdown products of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're measuring what it comes off the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with saliva and blood,
you're measuring THC directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for that reason, urine probably isn't a
great indicator of recent use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, as we know, the these breakdown
products of cannabis of THC can last in
[SPEAKER_01]: the urine for days, weeks, a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a great indicator of very
recent use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just says that somebody has used in the
past few days or potentially longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the lava tells you more of a short
time window in the past 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And blood can give you a more definitive
timeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if somebody has very high levels
of blood THC, then you know they've used
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly recently or smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barely recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they are lower than they would have
used at some point in the past day or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's more of an accurate time window
for blood and saliva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is it fairly easy to kind of look
at the concentrations in the blood or
[SPEAKER_00]: saliva and sort of trace backwards how
much cannabis the person could have
[SPEAKER_00]: ingested?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep kind of doing the
comparison to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you're at like a point
eight alcohol level, you can kind of kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of go back and be like, OK, they've
probably had a few a few drinks,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in the past hour or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do a similar thing with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really to estimate the last time of
use and the exact amount of use is quite
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging with cannabis because the
amount of THC in blood and urine is really
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on a lot of factors,
including age, sex, how often you use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, what form of cannabis you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that smoked and baked cannabis
produce very much higher levels very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly in blood and saliva than with
edibles, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But edibles last very a lot longer than
smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: With smoked or baked, it's gone in five
hours with edibles that can last much
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody comes up with 10 nanograms
per mil of THC, it's really hard to know
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of cannabis they used and when
they last used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, people who use frequently the
cannabis might stick around longer in the
[SPEAKER_01]: blood, urine than people who use
infrequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tell you've used recently,
but we don't know exactly how much or when
[SPEAKER_01]: that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dig into the study you did more
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please explain kind of what is it that
you looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of what makes this study maybe
different or more unique than the other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that have been done kind of more
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did differently was we compared
what the standard approach is to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships of blood THC to driving
versus what we thought might be
[SPEAKER_01]: informative in terms of what the legal
limits mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So traditionally, what people do is they
do that correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to go correlation, they look for
one to one mapping of blood THC to changes
[SPEAKER_01]: in driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the person who has the highest level of
blood THC would also have the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: level of change in driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the person with the lowest blood THC
would have the lowest change in driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone in the middle would sort of
map out, you know, correspondingly,
[SPEAKER_01]: incrementally within that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we find is that correlation is
not necessarily so straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people find there is a
correlation, others don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ask, are the legal limits somehow
informative as opposed to just trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: find a simple relationship between blood
THC and driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So given that the you know, we have these
legal limits in Canada and other
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions, can they help us detect who
is not capable or not fit to drive at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the conclusion was that those who were
above the higher, the more greater offense
[SPEAKER_01]: of blood THC, where we're definitely more
impaired than those who are below that
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our conclusion was that these limits
may have some utility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we did have, you know,
our caveats in there is just for smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we don't know all of the roots
of administration, we don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in frequency of use,
how that would affect it, but just
[SPEAKER_01]: basically that the limits may have some
utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'm curious, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you sort of look at the difference
in time from when they actually used and
[SPEAKER_00]: when the test was administered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it like quickly after?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you kind of give them time to maybe
sober up a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how did that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were all invited to the lab for
standard test sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were four test sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a part of a larger study
looking at the effects of alcohol and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you take alcohol and cannabis
together, does it make driving a lot worse
[SPEAKER_01]: than just alcohol or cannabis on their
own?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much worse is it combining the
two?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had four conditions, one in which
they just drank alcohol to a breath
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the target was 0.08, which is the
legal limit in Canada, which is about
[SPEAKER_01]: three about three drinks, I think,
depending on the size of the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other condition, they smoked
cannabis, twelve point five percent THC
[SPEAKER_01]: joint they were given.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other condition, they had the two
combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fourth test session, it was just a
placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just a fake alcohol,
fake cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't know what they were
getting at each test session.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were just given a drink and it
could have had vodka or could have just
[SPEAKER_01]: had lime juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly with the cannabis cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't know what they were given
on a certain day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did was they came in and they
went to our what we call our bar lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lab which looks like a bar,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they drank a drink of vodka,
a vodka drink, which doesn't smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't has very little taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could mask it quite easily with the
non alcohol condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then about half an hour later,
they were invited to our smoking lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: negative pressure room where they were
asked to smoke the cannabis to the usual
[SPEAKER_01]: level of intoxication and to stop if they
felt sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then about half an hour later,
they drove the simulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was very controlled for each person
was more or less the same interval between
[SPEAKER_01]: each each event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you said that you evaluated
whether the combination of alcohol and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis would be worse than either of
those alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the results there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, yeah, so there's just to give you
some background, there's a lot of sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: debate in the literature as to whether
combining alcohol and cannabis produce
[SPEAKER_01]: what's called additive effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just it's, you know, if you weave
or let's use the example of speed,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably easier to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your speed goes up by two miles an
hour under cannabis and two miles an hour
[SPEAKER_01]: under alcohol, if it's additive,
then taking the two would increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: speed by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's interactive or synergistic,
then it will be more than four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be eight or ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two actually work to make each
other a lot worse than just the sum of
[SPEAKER_01]: their parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some debate in the literature
as to whether the effects would be
[SPEAKER_01]: additive or synergistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that it was we believe it was
additive based on our data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't do the full analysis on that,
but we believe looking at the numbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was additive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their weaving doubled, so to speak,
without combining alcohol and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you just added the numbers up
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we published a review a couple of
years ago where we looked at combining
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol and cannabis on driving cognition,
so learning and memory and also the level
[SPEAKER_01]: of intoxication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most papers seem to show that it's an
additive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is like summing the parts and
combining the two is worse than either one
[SPEAKER_01]: alone, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how about cannabis versus
alcohol?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who did worse?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found they did similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that one study, the impairments were
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found that cannabis increased
weaving, which is a consistent finding
[SPEAKER_01]: across almost all the studies done with
cannabis and driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And alcohol also increased weaving,
which is also very consistent with
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much a hallmark of alcohol and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that's usually
impaired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were impaired to more or less the
same degree after alcohol and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then taking them together just doubled
it, doubled each one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, what's generally found with cannabis
is that cannabis also slows your time to
[SPEAKER_01]: react to events on the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't find that, but a lot of studies
do find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also alters your ability to
maintain a distance, proper distance with
[SPEAKER_01]: the car in front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also slows people down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're driving more carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who use cannabis say they're aware
that they're intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they slow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with alcohol, they drive faster
generally than slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting talking about the
differences between alcohol and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: yet again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are the impairing effects of
alcohol and cannabis different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think anyone who's used both
knows that they are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speak a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with respect to driving, cannabis
increases weaving, as does alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they're different mostly is that one
of the big findings that we get from
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that seems to come out in a lot
of papers, not all of them, is that it
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to slow people down because they
know they're impaired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're more cautious on the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean they're a better driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means that they know that they're
impaired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with alcohol, they speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're much more reckless drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the beginning of the interview,
we talked about what the effect
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization had on driving under the
influence of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned that in some
jurisdictions, the rate of driving under
[SPEAKER_01]: the influence of cannabis went down after
legalization or with legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because people think that
they're switching from alcohol to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So alcohol is much worse because maybe
they're not aware that they're as impaired
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're driving faster and they're
weaving on the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with cannabis, they're aware and
they're slowing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're compensating for their impairment,
but they're still impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's an interesting point,
too, because that might actually keep
[SPEAKER_00]: impaired drivers off the road,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they know that they're impaired and
maybe shouldn't be driving, maybe they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just choose not to drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think we have data on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly from talking to the
participants, in my studies, they
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely say that they don't drive after
they use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're aware that they're not driving
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very cautious about driving
after using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that tends to be what we get a lot in
self-report is people say that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we do know that about 25% of
people who use cannabis do drive after
[SPEAKER_01]: using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially with respect to medical
cannabis, people believe that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: affect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: After using cannabis for medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of measuring the
concentrations in the blood, it's my
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, too, that THC can be
detected in the blood for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: after use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we sort of control for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC in the blood can be detected in the
blood for a number of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen papers where it's above one
or two nanograms per mil, which is some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cutoffs for weeks, potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's generally in people who use cannabis
frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every day or more than once a day that
we see that these levels continue and they
[SPEAKER_01]: persist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a challenge, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's unknown is the degree of impairment
of people the day after they've used
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unknown right now if frequent users
are not good drivers the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some studies have found that they are
impaired, even though they haven't used
[SPEAKER_01]: that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some studies looking at
blood THC, which have found that people
[SPEAKER_01]: are more impaired as the blood THC goes up
the day after using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very relevant to medical users
and very frequent users who might have
[SPEAKER_01]: residual blood THC the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a question that still needs to
be explored, I think, more fully in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of what the long term effects are of using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just recently spoke with a
researcher in Australia, Danielle
[SPEAKER_00]: McCartney, who did a review of a lot of
these studies that are looking at next day
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, one of her conclusions was
that we need more studies because they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't all of really great quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully she's going to do some more
investigation into that and we can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: more definitive answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you did mention frequent users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to ask you, too, of the
participants in your study, were there
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis naive users or more frequent
users?
[SPEAKER_00]: And was there sort of a difference in
their performance?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the study that we have talking
about, the participants were required to
[SPEAKER_01]: use cannabis at least once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our studies need to get approval by
an ethics board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to make sure that our studies
are ethical and we're not putting our
[SPEAKER_01]: participants at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the criteria that
ethics boards, in my experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually have is that people who use
cannabis in a research study have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not potentially causing them
illness or something, an adverse event in
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we generally recruit people who use
cannabis at least once a week to ensure
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although that does vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will use more frequent users
and some people will recruit people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are less frequent users than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not break it down in our study by
frequency of use in terms of the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have looked at that and they have
looked at occasional sort of once a month
[SPEAKER_01]: users versus frequent users.
[SPEAKER_01]: So daily users are four times a week or
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, as a lot of things,
the findings are inconclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe of the three or four studies
done, roughly half find that frequent
[SPEAKER_01]: users are more impaired and half find that
they're less impaired than the occasional
[SPEAKER_01]: users.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking at doing a study or we're
gearing up to do a study where we look at
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency of use as a moderating variable
and also age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potentially the age of the participant
might interact with how frequency of use
[SPEAKER_01]: influences driving after using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was going to be my next question
is sort of where do we go from here and
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you looking at next?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you just answered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's other things that you're
investigating, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think age is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just finished a study looking at older
adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over 65 people over 65 are the fastest
or fastest growing population of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: users.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number of people over 65 who use
cannabis has grown exponentially in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past number of years compared to the
number of younger users who are increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: the compared to how many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the increase in prevalence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And younger adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet they're generally overlooked in
research studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know very little about how cannabis
affects older adults over 65 in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: how it affects memory, attention and other
cognitive measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly memory and attention are affected
by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also don't know very much about how it
affects their driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We finished a study and we just finished a
study where we showed that people over 65
[SPEAKER_01]: do show impairments in driving,
but it's unclear as to whether the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of change in driving was less than younger
adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe they're less sensitive to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know much about how blood THC
works in older adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that older adults have more body
fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have changes in metabolism,
so they're slower to metabolize drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potentially blood THC could break down
differently in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have very little information on
older adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Patricia, I do want to be very mindful
of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've kept you for the half hour
that I promised.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I let you go, I wanted to give
you an opportunity to share any other
[SPEAKER_00]: additional resources on this topic that
might be helpful for the listeners or the
[SPEAKER_00]: viewers to read more about, or if there's
a website or any way to get in touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: you if they have any additional questions
or just want to connect, please plug away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one resource that I use a lot,
which is it's a Canadian source,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it might be interesting to Americans
in other countries as well, just in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of general statistics on cannabis use and
how many people drive after using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, what age groups use cannabis,
what kinds of cannabis do people use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they use cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the Canadian Cannabis Survey,
and it's conducted by the sort of at the
[SPEAKER_01]: national level, and it's updated every
year in about November.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just Google Canadian Cannabis
Survey, you can see all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: statistics regarding cannabis use,
the impact of legalization, all those
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of questions people have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's Canadian source, but I'm sure
that it's not that very different across
[SPEAKER_01]: different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put a link to that in the show
description so people can find it.
