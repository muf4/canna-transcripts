[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met with Kyle Turley over lunch and we
decided we're gonna try and pass some
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation about mic height limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ADA issue for all those of us who
are taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel it would be only fair to have mics
that reach where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a, am I loud enough out
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to take a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a, I'm gonna steal a play
from Dr. Mishulam's playbook from his
[SPEAKER_00]: comments last night at dinner because I
think there is a similarity between those
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking immediately after lunch and those
speaking immediately after dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do have some formal comments to
make but I also, I will be telling a story
[SPEAKER_00]: because I thought his story last night was
absolutely wonderful for those of you who
[SPEAKER_00]: got to hear it and I think it's actually
part of the the documentary that was done
[SPEAKER_00]: about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story in particular about how he,
and he relayed some of it this morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: went to the police to essentially take
cannabis that was confiscated and use it
[SPEAKER_00]: for science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just a fantastic story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to echo also something that was
said earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, I believe, truly will when we look
back in a decade from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this day today in this auditorium
will be considered a milestone event and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a real
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just so honored to be part of it and I
do, I will say I do feel a little bit like
[SPEAKER_00]: an undergrad student at a graduate lecture
so I hope you'll bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my story, my story is, and some of you
have heard it so for those of you who've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard it I apologize for repeating but my
story is about these two little girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Addie and Cassie when they were
little kids and in 2005 and today they're
[SPEAKER_00]: 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in this picture they were give or
take a little over a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hell bent to be movie stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running around, you know, around age
three, age four we began to see a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of notice of wobble in their gait,
a little bit of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mental delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a perfect life at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my wife Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's sitting in the audience with a
different style of hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately we ended up in the hospital for
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually was initially diagnosed by
their pediatric doctor, Dr. Sorensen,
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered that they both had enlarged
spleens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was initially diagnosed as
mononucleosis which commonly manifests
[SPEAKER_00]: itself in enlarged spleens but we quickly
realized that that was far more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through a battery of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diagnosis, the odyssey of diagnosis
took well in excess of 18 months including
[SPEAKER_00]: what you see here which is the beginning
of the EEG process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately they were diagnosed with a
really horrible and largely fatal,
[SPEAKER_00]: untreatable cholesterol disorder called
Neumann-Pick type C.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lysosomal storage disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It manifests itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those little red dots on that
chromosome sequence are known genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: defects of that particular chromosome,
the MPC gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my kids have what's called MPC type C
which means that they do not process
[SPEAKER_00]: cholesterol either in or out of their
cells well, particularly their organ cells
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why they got enlarged spleens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly and most deadly is
the death that happens to their brain
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very severe neurodegenerative
disease from the onset of symptoms which
[SPEAKER_00]: in my children took place in around their
third year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their life expectancy is somewhere between
four and five years beyond that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an autorecessive gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't dive into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my undergraduate work and it'll
bore most of you to tears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up at the Mayo Clinic as many
folks do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Met with a doctor at the Mayo Clinic who
specializes in Neumann-Pick C.
[SPEAKER_00]: He essentially told us that there was one
experimental drug that was improved in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, not approved in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could convince our insurance company
to spend $100,000 a year per kid to put
[SPEAKER_00]: them on it, we could use it as treatment
for our children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only expected to make a 10%
difference in the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't a good diagnosis and certainly
wasn't a good prediction of outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then ended up at the NIH in Bethesda.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a natural history study underway
sponsored by the NIH and thank God it was
[SPEAKER_00]: underway because it became the basis in
some ways for what we ultimately achieved
[SPEAKER_00]: as parents to find a drug for our kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I immediately formed a
research foundation, raised a few million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars and started putting it to work,
piggybacking off then already existing
[SPEAKER_00]: research in the NPC community from very,
very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very fine researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly we entered into the ecosystem
of NPC at a very fortunate time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kids went through a full week of
testing at the NIH and our life changed
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: We became citizen scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I have technology and public
relations backgrounds predominantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met at Netscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent my early part of my career at
Apple and other technology companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We became scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we discovered along the way very
quickly was a compound called
[SPEAKER_00]: cyclodextrin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cyclodextrin is a grass compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used as an incipient, as a
solubilizer in many, many products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the basis for the product Febreze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in almost every single Procter &
Gamble product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used in mayonnaise to enhance flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used in soft drinks, chewing gum,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're surrounded by cyclodextrin almost
anywhere you go in our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that cyclodextrin is an
active ingredient and is now in phase two,
[SPEAKER_00]: three clinical research at the NIH to
treat my children's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the first, my kids were the first
to see this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already talked a little bit about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we became drug developers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that the drug was only
available in pharmaceutical grade as part
[SPEAKER_00]: of another drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was manufactured by Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of J&J.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reached out to J&J and said,
hey, how'd you like to share your drug
[SPEAKER_00]: master file and your manufacturing
technology so that we can make this drug
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty much what they said in
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my wife, being who she is,
those of you who know, know what I'm about
[SPEAKER_00]: to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't take no for an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she immediately wrote a blog that
said, effectively, does J&J care about
[SPEAKER_00]: children?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer was, yes, we care about
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, by the way, we've rethought our
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will not only share your our drug
master file for the use of cyclodextrin as
[SPEAKER_00]: an active ingredient in your drug,
we will actually set up a manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and make this drug not only for
your children, but for all the children in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world that can get a compassionate use
IND approved by the FDA, by their doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And subsequently now I think about 100
kids around the world are on this amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And effectively what we're talking about
is translational medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about repurposing an
existing compound in this case it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: known as an active ingredient,
has subsequently become so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're repurposing it in the
translational medical science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that took filings with the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the pink binders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are unique colors to our children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my wife chose them so that they would
get attention at the FDA and ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: get our approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in less than 18 months after our
diagnosis, ultimately the diagnosis took
[SPEAKER_00]: place out of testing from Stanford.
[SPEAKER_00]: But within 18 months out of the testing,
we had submitted and gotten approval to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat our children with cyclodextrin
intravenously.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, we had tried it through the
gut initially only to find out that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't pass through into the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, once we started
treating our children intravenously,
[SPEAKER_00]: we discovered through follow-up research
that we had sponsored that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really pass the blood-brain barrier very
well either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only did we file an IND for
intravenous treatment of cyclodextrin with
[SPEAKER_00]: our children, we then subsequently filed
another compassionate use IND with the FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: to get our kids treated intrathecally.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, a spinal tap straight into
their spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the last four and a half,
five years, they have been receiving,
[SPEAKER_00]: every other week they receive either an
intravenous infusion, which turns out does
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in small quantities pass the
blood-brain, the BBB.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also turns out it helps their
systems, their organs and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: clear cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the off week, we take them to the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fully anesthetized and they
receive a spinal tap to receive this drug
[SPEAKER_00]: into their CSF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has, we believe, extended their
life by quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the initial installation of their
ports for the intravenous infusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get a mainline port infusion every
other week on Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the very first compounds that
we made.
[SPEAKER_00]: These compounds were actually made at our
at the pharmacy in our local hospital in
[SPEAKER_00]: Reno, Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were compounded by this wonderful man
on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Adam Porath.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a little known pharmacist,
hospital pharmacist, who I think is part
[SPEAKER_00]: of an amazing story that is now saving
other children's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the first one to figure out how to
do all the osmolarity testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the necessary sterilization,
because we were actually receiving the
[SPEAKER_00]: compound in a powder form and it had to be
turned into a drug that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable to the FDA to be not only
infused into the bloodstream, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: into the past the blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the kids receiving their
infusions at the infusion center at Reno.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 400 plus, I think it's now more than
500 IV infusions later.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get mega doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we started down the path.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, Walgreens has been
unbelievable in this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually helped us work through a
third IND, which got us approval to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: our children at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we no longer have to take them to the
hospital for this treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little pump that we treat them
at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cyclodextrin, then the whole effort
took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we worked with the NIH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NIH ultimately licensed or
sub-licensed all of the data that we
[SPEAKER_00]: collected as IND patients, plus a whole
bunch of data they created in-house
[SPEAKER_00]: through a small, I think, N of six phase
one sort of safety clinical study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now in phase two dash three on the
fast track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase study supported by a company called
Vitess who licensed all the technology and
[SPEAKER_00]: is taking over the drug as a manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our dream was a sterile solution that
was, you know, available for both IV and
[SPEAKER_00]: IT, and it's now happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is, manufactured by Janssen,
available in sterile bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say, we just don't do this
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give public credit to Janssen J
&J for stepping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was risky on their part, and they were
just amazing, amazing partners in this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the twins are still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had their 12th birthday last January.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's amazing in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: After all these treatments, we've seen no
toxicity creeping in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their plasma oxytero biomarkers have
really improved, and especially their
[SPEAKER_00]: seven-keto cholesterol levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tau and A beta levels are dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all the signs of neurological
stress, inflammation, or degradation are
[SPEAKER_00]: improving as a result of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out, and we've already talked a
little bit about mechanism of action and
[SPEAKER_00]: the mysteries of mechanism of action,
it turns out during this entire process,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the scientists involved had any
idea how cyclodextrin was working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The assumption is that it was working
similar to the way that cholesterol,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that odors are kept captured by
Febreze, turns out that that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just this last week, a seminal paper
was published about cyclodextrin and its
[SPEAKER_00]: use in the treatment of atherosclerosis,
which elucidated its mechanism of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we sort of stabilized our
children with a drug through the FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: process, became aware of what's involved
in doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really respect those of you who are
involved in that process, because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: daunting and involved and expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And time-consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't helpful for my kids'
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our kids began suffering several years ago
from nowhere near the Dravet kids' sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of seizures, but still a disturbing
level of seizure activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did like every other parent does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to treat it with pharmaceutical
meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically just turned our kids into
zombies, had horrible side effects for
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and decided to chase cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that Dr. Gupta's story,
you know, the weed one about the Stanleys
[SPEAKER_00]: and Charlotte's Web and so forth was just
coming out, or, you know, about six months
[SPEAKER_00]: after we started looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, Sanjay had already been
covering our story about cyclodextrin in
[SPEAKER_00]: our kids, so we had been interacting with
him, and he had mentioned to us,
[SPEAKER_00]: as had others, about trying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually a picture of one of
the very first bottles of oil that we used
[SPEAKER_00]: when we treated our kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started this treatment several years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bottle is approximately an 18 to 1
CBD to THC ratio suspended in a safflower
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we discovered in the process of
treating our kids with essentially what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would largely say is a very sophisticated
home-grown oil was that the supply of this
[SPEAKER_00]: oil and its safety was of paramount
importance to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took what we had learned in our
process of, you know, working with
[SPEAKER_00]: cyclodextrin and building a drug through
the FDA and formed a company that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: Stern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stern is a very well-known manufacturer of
cannabis-based products in oil form and in
[SPEAKER_00]: other routes of administration,
as possible by state regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we embarked and have just recently
announced $8 million in funding to launch
[SPEAKER_00]: our product development, or more
importantly, our product manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts in the state of Colorado,
Washington state, and Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have facilities built and ready to
produce products in Seattle, Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: and soon to finish in Reno as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of the machine that we
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 70-liter CO2 extraction machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one part of a complex process of
making these oils to the highest grade
[SPEAKER_00]: standards that we know how to make,
and I think to what the industry is making
[SPEAKER_00]: at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make a multi-ratio product,
20 to 1, 1 to 20, and 1 to 1 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from these three products,
a parent or a patient could come up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio of their own design, obviously
capped by 20 to 1 at the high end on the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to talk a little bit about,
so that's our story, that's my story,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's, I know that the title of my
talk for today was about rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of necessity, I have become a
little bit of a cannabis policy wonk
[SPEAKER_00]: because it worries me as a business person
to take my investors' money without a
[SPEAKER_00]: clear path for how they're going to get
their returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make these medicines under the
belief that we can actually get them out
[SPEAKER_00]: to lots and lots of people, and
ultimately, as I think we all know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to require some form of
rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that rescheduling is the
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that if I could wave my magic
wand and convince the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should hold our ground and
insist on a descheduling or the creation
[SPEAKER_00]: of a...
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we, or better yet, the creation of
a parallel path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's face it, tobacco and alcohol are on
a parallel path.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not on schedule anything,
although they arguably should be,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly if cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to see, there's already a
movement afoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The states have already said we're going
to authorize the creation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let the federal government embrace
that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let the states regulate the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's layer on top of that federal
regulation, which really focuses on the
[SPEAKER_00]: GMP process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our facilities are designed to GMP CFR
111, which is the nutraceutical or dietary
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's the minimum standard
that should be established.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see the federal government
insist that the states enforce that
[SPEAKER_00]: standard, just as they insist that the
states enforce things like diversion or
[SPEAKER_00]: proximity to schools and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways to regulate this product
without putting it into the drug schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: and certainly, most importantly,
without putting it into the crosshairs of
[SPEAKER_00]: the FDA for the full monty on drug
approval process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many incarnations of this
drug that can be delivered as a dietary
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement, and that should be allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just hope that we can figure out as
a society how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, one more soap box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis belongs to mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis does not belong to one company,
one brand, one method of action,
[SPEAKER_00]: one process technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It belongs to all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a world that pretty much
embraced open source technology in the
[SPEAKER_00]: software community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open source as a concept has become
further and more recognized as a viable
[SPEAKER_00]: capital endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to suggest that we as a community
make a pact with each other to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as a shared asset and not to lock
it up, not to put it behind the pharma
[SPEAKER_00]: fence, not to put it in a cage where
people can't make it unless they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: patent on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my, as a parent and as a
patient advocate, one of my worst
[SPEAKER_00]: nightmares is that we will not learn from
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, somewhat in honor of Dr.
Mishulam, certainly, but in honor of my
[SPEAKER_00]: children and all the patients out there
who need more understanding Dr. Goldstein
[SPEAKER_00]: this morning talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everyone has talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need far more research, especially
human clinical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the spirit of not having enough to
do, my wife and I got together and we
[SPEAKER_00]: asked the IRS to give us approval to
create a research foundation called
[SPEAKER_00]: PeopleCan.
[SPEAKER_00]: PeopleCan is now approved as a 501C3
specifically to fund, organize,
[SPEAKER_00]: and orchestrate human clinical research in
cannabis worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually just, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually just got approval and we just
hired an executive director.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like Jason to stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just getting started and the
first task is to raise a little money to
[SPEAKER_00]: build out the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am of the opinion, informed I hope,
opinion that it is possible to do clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: research on cannabis in the United States
without the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the FDA's approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without even the FDA's approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product is a dietary supplement in
many of its forms and we can research it
[SPEAKER_00]: as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we intend to work with the IRB
community, figure out a way to get this
[SPEAKER_00]: done, and embrace the rest of you in that
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you'll engage with us in that
process on many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
