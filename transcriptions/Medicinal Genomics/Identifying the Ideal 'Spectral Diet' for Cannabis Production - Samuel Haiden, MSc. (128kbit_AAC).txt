[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm here to bring you guys back to the
world of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Sam Hayden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for the Agricultural Biotechnology
Lab at the University of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank CanMed for inviting me
and of course my PI Dr. Gerald Berkowitz
[SPEAKER_00]: for funding me for this wonderful
adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first I'd like to just go over a little
bit about what we do in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our lab mostly deals with the regulation
of gene expression in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we also study gene function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're seeing here is some work
that we've done characterizing
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factors that induce trichome
morphogenesis in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these is a MIB transcription factor
called Mixta, which is the focus of my
[SPEAKER_00]: master's thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top left here you're seeing a
transient expression study in Nicosiana,
[SPEAKER_00]: Benthamiana, where we showed the nuclear
localization of this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right you're seeing QPCR results
for the expression pattern of this gene
[SPEAKER_00]: over seven weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that it's peaking right about
the time the cannabinoid biosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to ramp up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the bottom two photos you're
seeing are scanning electron micrographs
[SPEAKER_00]: of trichomes of Nicosiana tobacco leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the left you're seeing a wild type
leaf with a normal distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes and normal branching in the
trichomes more importantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the right you're seeing
tobacco leaf that is stably transformed
[SPEAKER_00]: and over expressing this cannabis protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing is a significantly
increased number of trichomes and also
[SPEAKER_00]: increased trichome branching, which I
think is a more important find there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically this is an example of
just what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do expression and heterologous systems
to identify gene function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use a lot of QPCR to determine how
these genes are regulated, how their
[SPEAKER_00]: expression is regulated, and what their
expression patterns are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also interested in enzymes involved
in cannabinoid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Lauren Sands, she's also from our
lab, gave a presentation on PT4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interesting to note too is that all of
these genes are coordinated in this
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful symphony and that cannabinoid
biosynthesis isn't actually just as simple
[SPEAKER_00]: as the biosynthetic enzymes, because those
enzymes themselves are controlled by
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome genes, which are controlled by
flowering genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really a complex system here
and that's more or less what we study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is made by Peter Apicella.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a student in our lab and he
utilized some of my data to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation matrix, which shows how this
mixta gene, it's labeled here as TFY,
[SPEAKER_00]: is tightly correlated with very important
genes in cannabinoid biosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: namely being geranyl pyrophosphate
synthase and olivatolic acid cyclase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you here probably know that those
are the precursors for CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the expression of this
mixta gene was actually tightly correlated
[SPEAKER_00]: with the expression of those two genes,
which to me was interesting, because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen from other research that cannabinoids
aren't really produced until the trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: produces a stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually interested in seeing what
trichome genes are initiating the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of the stalk, which may be
also thereby activating cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just a good way to illustrate
the symphony, again, of all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different enzymes and products that are
working in coordination to generate these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that we love so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on from what we do, I'm gonna
talk about, I'm gonna get into this
[SPEAKER_00]: spectral diet question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned genetic expression,
the regulation of gene expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: because how we're looking at spectral diet
is a means of manipulating gene expression
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to accomplish crop steering
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hear this buzzword a lot,
achieving full genetic expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to achieve the full expression of
the genetic potential of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: People throw that term around a lot,
and I don't think that they fully
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what that means, but we're
gonna get to the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I look at it and the way many
people look at it is that your breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and genotype selection is where you
determine the roof, the potential that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can hope to live up to, and the way to do
that is by removing limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So limiting factors being par,
nutrition, transpiration rates via VPD,
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure your CO2 levels are all
adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So theoretically, by removing these
limiting factors, we're allowing the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to achieve its fullest potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you've removed all of these
limiting factors, what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, we're talking about crop
steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about actually pushing that
roof and increasing the potential that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can hope to live up to by modifying the
way that the plant grows with
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental signals and cues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these cues deal with genetic
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spectral diet is a method of crop
steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: AROIA defines this as being the strategic
adjustment of the environment to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to grow in a specific pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're trying to control these
growth patterns by controlling gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression because gene expression is at
the base of so much of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rapidity at which a plant starts to
flower is often determined by the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression levels of certain genes at
certain times and how they're regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first examples I ever saw of
this was back in my medical growing days
[SPEAKER_00]: when my gurus back then would insist that
we swap out every other HPS with a CMH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was really common, and it
produced better flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really knew why, but we all
presumed that it was because of the wider
[SPEAKER_00]: spectral range that you see in the metal
halide spectrograph there as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS, which is mostly yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't really data behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just did it because it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what we're finding is
there's actually maybe some data to
[SPEAKER_00]: support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the left picture here,
you're seeing a greenhouse being
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementally lit by red and far-red
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a strategy that's taken up by
ornamental growers, lots of growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: because red to far-red ratios affect the
expression of genes downstream of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome, which is something I'm gonna
start talking about in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these strategies have been taken up by
other industries, not only in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: what spectrum of the spectral diet to give
the plant at a consistent rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also ways that we can give little
shots of different wavelengths to elicit a
[SPEAKER_00]: different response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very complex, wide-reaching
subject, DLI, photoperiod, fluence rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're focused on in this study,
reductive, of course, is blue to red
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios and red to far-red ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ratios are known to affect two
signaling molecules in the plant known as
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome and cryptochrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out, as it happens, I think that
cryptochrome may actually be the more
[SPEAKER_00]: important signaling molecule in activating
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we originally were pursuing
red-far-red ratios and phytochrome
[SPEAKER_00]: activity because it's very well studied
and because it has been shown to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: origin of the shade avoidance response.
[SPEAKER_00]: If many of you have heard of that,
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, the shade avoidance
response is when the plant registers that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's under shaded light because of the
increased ratio of far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far-red having a lower energy and a longer
wavelength is able to penetrate deep into
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy, and red light is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant has evolved to know that when
it gets a lot of far-red, that it's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this phytochrome molecule becomes
inactivated, and that results in what's
[SPEAKER_00]: known as the shade avoidance response,
where the stem elongates and it attempts
[SPEAKER_00]: to escape that poor light to get to the
good light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that that was happening,
we thought that this might be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate to target for manipulation to
see if we can affect gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, on the right, you're seeing a
diagram of the current model for flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation in Arabidopsis, which is a
long-day plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's interesting to note because
most of what we know about these signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways has been studied in Arabidopsis,
which has a different mechanism of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering than short-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short-day plants or cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, short-day flowering is
much less well understood, much less well
[SPEAKER_00]: studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, rice is a very good model species
that we can use to understand that because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also a short-day plant and a model
species that has been heavily studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that data, from that literature,
we know that Constans and FT are two genes
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream of both phytochrome and
cryptochrome, which initiate flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two genes, we've actually gone
ahead and studied those in further
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, the point is that these two
genes, although they're present in
[SPEAKER_00]: short-day plants like cannabis or rice,
they have a slightly different signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology, a different signaling
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that creates a lot of good
opportunities for research because in
[SPEAKER_00]: studying cannabis, flowering, we can learn
more about how short-day plants flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are we doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hasn't this already been done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't Bruce Bugbee already cover all of
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question I have to ask myself is
why bother?
[SPEAKER_00]: What have previous studies lacked?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is actually kind of
glaring like a big problem because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed that most studies done on light
wavelengths are done using different
[SPEAKER_00]: fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're comparing HPS to metal halide to
different LED arrays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, there's a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not just testing one variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: These spectral diets vary in many,
many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, this is an example of a
popular study which made the conclusion
[SPEAKER_00]: that, sorry, I say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three graphs you see at the bottom are
a study that was done which implied that
[SPEAKER_00]: the increasing blue photon fraction
decreases yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take a look at these graphs,
you'll see that from left to right,
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue photon fraction increases,
but the red photon fraction actually
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering how we're able to make
conclusions absolutely about blue photon
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction when there are other variables
that are also changing which have a
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not confident in these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not confident that decreasing blue
photon or increasing blue photon fraction
[SPEAKER_00]: will decrease yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for instance, we didn't keep the
red light constant in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red light decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the blue to red ratio is actually
decreasing in each of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So theoretically, if you wanted to,
you could possibly say that the decreasing
[SPEAKER_00]: blue to red ratio is what's causing these
yield losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to shout out to adaptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we're getting around this is
that adaptive grow technologies has
[SPEAKER_00]: donated these lights to us which enable us
to use the exact same fixture with the
[SPEAKER_00]: same diode arrays, but then to either turn
on or off different diodes in those
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can control all of the different
spectral ratios except for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the advantage we have at ABL
over other labs that are trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's ironic that I say that because I
handed this off to a student who was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to pick up the project and didn't,
and I asked them to set this up to study
[SPEAKER_00]: high red ratios versus low red ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they did not control for
the blue to red ratio which is exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: issue we've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here there's a low,
in T1, the top figure, there's a low red
[SPEAKER_00]: to far red ratio meaning there's a lot of
far red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a high blue to red ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm almost happy he did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it ended up showing us something
that's worth knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because basically there's two variables,
low red to far red, high blue to red in
[SPEAKER_00]: the top figure compared to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results of this were interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very exciting because we
actually saw a pretty significant increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf surface area is a phenotypic change
which is maybe not as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a significant and large increase in
flower biomass was the result of this
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question becomes which of the
two variables is responsible for this
[SPEAKER_00]: change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the low red to far red which is the
opposite of what we expected?
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that the low red to far red
would decrease yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it the blue to red?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is what we need to study now
and that's what we've continued to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a new experiment where I picked
this up and I controlled for the blue to
[SPEAKER_00]: red ratio and I manipulated only the red
to far red ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those are the two that we consider
to be biologically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the result of this was absolutely no
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the let down, not very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what we found is that red to
far red ratios are having no considerable
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that also leads us to some other
interesting conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did also do is we studied the
cannabinoids and we found that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that was present was the CBGA,
THCA, and CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found no change in CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, by week six, in the high red to
far red treatment, we actually saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically significant increase in
CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting because it indicates
there might be some gene expression
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also interesting because we see
that although there's an increase in CBGA,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no increase in CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are concerned with what's the rate
limiting step in cannabinoid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of gives us some information
to chew on to think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is the same data,
but this is on the composite dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of with the fresh flower,
we just took the terminal flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this composite measurement,
we took each plant dried and milled the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant together and measured that
composite sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still find that there's actually an
even greater increase in CBGA in the
[SPEAKER_00]: composite sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, no change in anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, not that exciting,
but there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned these flowering genes that
are downstream of cryptochrome and
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are also very interesting
targets for breeding and for potential
[SPEAKER_00]: biotechnological work because these genes
are what signal the plant to start
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was interesting because,
like I said, we are trying to manipulate
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression using spectrums,
not only to understand how to better
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate the plant, but potentially to
better understand how the plant functions
[SPEAKER_00]: and what genes are doing and how they're
activating these flowering cascades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so interestingly enough, we found that
constants and FT expression were changed
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly from this light treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, this is the first
time that anybody's actually characterized
[SPEAKER_00]: the expression patterns of these genes in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty excited to say that the
expression patterns of these genes so far
[SPEAKER_00]: line up quite well with the rice model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like we could actually use
the rice model to try and understand which
[SPEAKER_00]: genes are actually important for flowering
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is evidence to suggest that that
would actually be a good comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Florigen is a critical night length gated
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that before flowering,
at day zero, its expression was basically
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it increases to 6,000 and 12,000
fold in the first week of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that indicates that these genes are
probably important.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I will say that the sad thing is
that although we saw the change in
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of these genes, we saw no
change in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of commercial value,
maybe we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's interesting to note that
although these genes' expression were
[SPEAKER_00]: changed, they had no effect on yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so coming to the end of the talk here,
this is what we're doing right now as we
[SPEAKER_00]: speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this will be our best
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the first experiment,
we had two variables in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second experiment, we reduced that
to one variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this experiment, we're testing the
other variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw an effect in the first one,
no effect in the second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect we'll see some change here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to the other study that I
mentioned, I believe that in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: the increasing blue photon fraction will
actually increase yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that we've kept
the red constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're looking at, rather than the
total fluence at any different wavelength,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually looking at the ratio of one
wavelength to another, which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: the more biologically significant factor
to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to turn out great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a photo of that happening
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our grow tents, you can see on the
right, you've got a much bluer sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: looking spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the left, you've got this white to
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a little bit more like what an
HPS would because that's actually more
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to what an HPS spectrum actually
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, in conclusion, red to far red
seem to have no effect, except for
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing CBGA, which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although the expression of constants
and FT were changed, it had no impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: yield whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, FT and constants have very
similar expression patterns in cannabis as
[SPEAKER_00]: they do in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we believe that the increasing
blue to red ratio is likely to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't quote me on that until I get my
data back because then we'll know for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, big thanks to Adaptive Grow
Technologies for the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Gorilla Grow for donating these tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the greenhouse staff at UConn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, shout out to Austin Schett from
Rapid Genomics because he hooked me up
[SPEAKER_00]: with these gene candidates for genes
downstream of phytochrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
