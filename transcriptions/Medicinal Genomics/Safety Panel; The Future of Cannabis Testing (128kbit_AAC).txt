[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everyone, for joining us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am being joined on stage for the panel
entitled The Future of Cannabis Testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I would like to acknowledge that
these people have really been leaders in
[SPEAKER_06]: the industry for the past five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everyone on the stage has been
testing cannabis since stringent
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations were even passed in the state.
[SPEAKER_06]: So not only have they kind of driven the
direction of where cannabis is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: be, but they've already kind of set the
standard for where it is now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would just like to give them a couple
of minutes to introduce themselves to the
[SPEAKER_06]: audience so you know who you're talking
to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first, Sabino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Sabino Segura.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been testing cannabis in the
analytical setting for the last eight
[SPEAKER_03]: years, working on mostly method
development, method validations according
[SPEAKER_03]: to different state and federal
regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything from pesticides to cannabinoids
and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Stephen Goldman.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the laboratory director of a testing
facility in Denver, Colorado called
[SPEAKER_04]: FIDOTEC.
[SPEAKER_04]: We opened in 2013, so going on six years
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been lucky enough to test over
150,000 compliance samples and many tens
[SPEAKER_04]: of thousands more R&D.
[SPEAKER_04]: So starting to get to a place where we can
really leverage the data set that we've
[SPEAKER_04]: acquired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Ineofia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently scientific director at Canna
Safe Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to believe the largest lab and
the world's first accredited lab in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Current market shareholder, testing just
about over a third of the products that go
[SPEAKER_02]: on the shelves here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Cindy Orser.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the chief science officer for Digipath
Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a testing lab in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been practicing science for over 30
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my PhD at UC Berkeley, where I
worked on biogenic isonucleation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a fascinating topic I'd love to
tell you all about one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically responsible for frost
injury worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider myself an innovator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with my PhD, I came up with a way
to control frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frost injury, but the EPA prevented that
product from ever moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually filed the first environmental
impact statement for GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very interesting, sort of set
the stage for my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked across many disciplines,
from toxicology, trying to create a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure human mutation rates, describing
dehalogenation reactions, how
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms co-opt existing function to
break down man-made chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've developed rapid diagnostics for
homeland security for biological toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about six years ago, I fell into what
I call the black hole of cannabis testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a head hunter contacted me and asked
if I would be interested in building out a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis testing lab for a public company
in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, one of my first hires was
Eni Afia, and I could not have done it
[SPEAKER_00]: without him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an amazing experience, starting out
with basically nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no validated methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were few certified reference
standards so it really was quite an
[SPEAKER_00]: undertaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those of you who don't know,
my name is Andrew Pham from Alchemist
[SPEAKER_06]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are a DEA registered botanical testing
lab with over 20 years of experience in
[SPEAKER_06]: the lab testing industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you all for joining us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for caring about lab testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of reasons to care about lab
testing, and I don't think you need to go
[SPEAKER_06]: any further than to look at the news and
think about the evaping crisis that's
[SPEAKER_06]: affecting hundreds of people across the
country.
[SPEAKER_06]: The CDC has reported over 300 to 500 cases
for both nicotine and cannabis related
[SPEAKER_06]: vapes, most of them sourced from the black
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just really wanted to ask the
panelists, do you think lab testing could
[SPEAKER_06]: have prevented this crisis, or do you
think it's too soon to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that lab testing,
as it currently stands, wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: prevented this crisis because we're not
looking for the things that are supposedly
[SPEAKER_03]: causing this vape crisis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've heard a lot about vitamin E
acetate, a little bit about mineral oil
[SPEAKER_03]: and other dopants being added to the vape
carts in order to dilute the product or to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep a proper consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, those aren't common
things that are tested for in an
[SPEAKER_03]: analytical laboratory because they're not
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as well, a lot of the manufacturers
don't disclose the ingredients.
[SPEAKER_03]: They keep them for proprietary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lab wouldn't know, and until
regulations change in which they have to
[SPEAKER_03]: start disclosing these things,
we might continue to see this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and in Colorado, it's an open
market, so there is about 3,000 licenses,
[SPEAKER_04]: many, but not all of which test with our
company, and less than 10% of them test
[SPEAKER_04]: what's outside of the required testing
panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's definitely the minority of
companies that are looking at these
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do almost zero raw materials testing in
the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the manufacturers are just now
learning what GMP or good manufacturing
[SPEAKER_04]: practices are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's just in its infancy right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not quite to the point where we're
starting to think about assessing risks
[SPEAKER_04]: and minimizing risks during manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think testing would have caught
this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumping on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lab testing wouldn't have prevented this,
but it's important to note when the issue
[SPEAKER_02]: did begin, it was pertinent for labs to
jump on it and provide as much information
[SPEAKER_02]: as possible, which CannaSafe did,
quickly developing a method for vitamin A
[SPEAKER_02]: acetate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's not known to be the culprit,
but it's a common denominator in these
[SPEAKER_02]: illicit vape cards, we actually went out
and bought a lot of illicit vape cards and
[SPEAKER_02]: tested them ourselves, along with some of
our clients' products, and noticed that,
[SPEAKER_02]: yes, they contain high levels,
some up to 40% of vitamin A acetate oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: with low label claims and pretty much at
least 10 to 20 different pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not quite known what is the cause,
but contribution of all of these factors
[SPEAKER_02]: could be very disastrous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important, although labs don't
test for these excipients and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's important to jump on it as soon as we
feel that public safety is at risk,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think it's a responsibility for the
labs in the state to get on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, perhaps if the federal
government made this federally legal,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would allow for or not allow for some
of these black market players to be in the
[SPEAKER_02]: space and perhaps increase consumer
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the whole vape cartridge
issue we're facing right now was fully
[SPEAKER_00]: expected by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four years ago, I wrote a blog on the
unknown hazards of vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a myriad of issues, starting with
the fact, as was already mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the producers don't have to list the
ingredients that they put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: State regulators are so far in over their
heads, they don't even realize the
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity of these products and the
pending health crisis that we could be
[SPEAKER_00]: witnessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the industry for the first time is
going to see class action lawsuits because
[SPEAKER_00]: now these companies are making enough
money and there are enough individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: that are being impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a case study that was in the
news from the UK, a 19 year old individual
[SPEAKER_00]: who had been vaping for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shared the x-rays of his lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were half full of a substance that
resembled bacon grease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's a good idea to inhale
lipids or to inhale oil droplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This points to the lack of oversight in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we should all come together
and require stricter standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have never been any inhalation
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tobacco industry got off without
having to conduct these studies for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades and decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we should insist that we see
some animal inhalation studies done on the
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents that are used in these
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I'd like to jump on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important because I think a lot of
producers out there use ingredients that
[SPEAKER_02]: they tout as grass status by the FDA,
generally recognized as safe, but those
[SPEAKER_02]: studies weren't done in inhalation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can rub vitamin E acetate or vitamin E
oil topically, but it's never been studied
[SPEAKER_02]: what happens when you ignite and inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany, there's a list of what are the
ingredients that can go in beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it's just totally up to the
imagination of the producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yesterday, we heard in the terpene
talk that some of these vape fluids are up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 60% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are also oils and they can
penetrate your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can coat your tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the positives out of this
could be that there will be a return to
[SPEAKER_00]: vaping flour, which I consider to be the
most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very effective and safe way of
using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for your thoughtful
responses.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a very interesting consensus here
that you all acknowledge that the current
[SPEAKER_06]: state of cannabis testing probably
wouldn't have prevented this crisis from
[SPEAKER_06]: happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: In your opinions, what in the future do
you think, what kind of new regulations or
[SPEAKER_06]: new standards of testing should be
implemented in order to prevent this from
[SPEAKER_06]: happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as far as regulations go,
they could start regulating what sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: diluents and other additive ingredients
should be allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be a very restrictive list and
it shouldn't be very many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shouldn't be allowed to add anything
cheap or untested into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even a lot of manufacturers will use
propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin.
[SPEAKER_03]: These aren't necessarily the greatest
things ever, but they're highly prevalent
[SPEAKER_03]: in the tobacco industry, in the nicotine
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until all of these things start coming
under a set of monitoring lists that will
[SPEAKER_03]: look for some of these additives and
regulate them, I don't think there's
[SPEAKER_03]: anything we can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: As an aside, all of these vape carts were
all illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were not being monitored.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were not being sold on any legitimate
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until we make an effort to bridge the
legal and illegal markets, we won't be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to control this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say even simpler than that,
in Colorado there's no approval process
[SPEAKER_04]: for a product.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to make a product with the
cannabinoid in it, you do that and then
[SPEAKER_04]: you sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you're not contributing flour
to the black market, there's very little
[SPEAKER_04]: that will stop you to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One example of the openness of the market
are nasal spray products, which started
[SPEAKER_04]: appearing on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We asked the regulators at the Department
of Public Health, are you concerned with
[SPEAKER_04]: applying products that could have very
sensitive microbial agents in them
[SPEAKER_04]: directly on someone's mucosal membrane?
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, they're selling those on the
market right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's literally no oversight or product
approval process or thought to what
[SPEAKER_04]: additives and risks are going into these
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were discussing earlier
whether these are acute toxicities or due
[SPEAKER_02]: to long-term exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Cindy kind of touched on it
earlier in that essentially we're all,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, guinea pigs in this,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So people have been vaping probably the
illicit black market material for quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: while now, and now it's becoming a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what other issues are we going to see
from long-term exposure to these toxins?
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulation-wise, it'll be very difficult
to enact regulation to stop some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: excipients or diluents from being used
because, well, to do that you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: perform a study, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally it's a long-term thing,
and I don't see that happening overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't just, you know, handicap the
cannabis industry from producing vape
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to say this while you
guys are out here, this city I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: believe has legal shops yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you're, you know, enjoying your
products, just be careful what you buy out
[SPEAKER_02]: there that there are a lot of illicit
stuff out there even mimicking licensed
[SPEAKER_02]: vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think first and foremost the producer
should be required to list exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're putting in their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would just be a first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So full disclosure that you at least would
know what you're vaping into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we probably have gotten to this
point because the industry has light years
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead of the regulators because this is
such a creative, fast-moving space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall I think it points to the
issues that surround this industry because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the disconnect from state and federal
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what has let the black
market explode in the vape cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so easy to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to say what's in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have the synthetic
cannabinoid issue as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a culprit in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really because we have not had
federal public funding to do basic
[SPEAKER_00]: research so that we can actually
understand what are the health impacts of
[SPEAKER_00]: not only the cannabinoids and the
terpenes, but some of these excipients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be just really great if there
was a source of federal money so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could do the proper basic, you know,
ventilation studies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a good word to touch on is
probably transparency then.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're required to list what's in
their product, then I think manufacturers
[SPEAKER_06]: need to be more transparent in doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And cultivators need to be transparent in
how they grow their products as well with
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticides, EPM, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But kind of pivoting just as importantly
is that testing labs need to be
[SPEAKER_06]: transparent with their methods as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a very common complaint.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you've all heard this,
that you can send a sample to 10 different
[SPEAKER_06]: labs and get 10 different results.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of that is on us and some of that
isn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a million reasons why that
happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was wondering if you guys could kind
of share the intricacies of why there are
[SPEAKER_06]: inconsistencies between results from
different labs and what we can do to kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of fix that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's definitely a multi-part answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, the plants, if you're
talking about cannabis flower,
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant itself will vary in potency by
up to 15% that we found in some of our
[SPEAKER_03]: tests that we've done between laboratories
as sort of a gauge to see, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's testing this different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we send the same sample to all these
different laboratories and see how
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone reports back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And different parts of the plant have
tested up to 15% of the value as being
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is talking about THC percentage
in particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as well you have the
methodologies, everybody's methodology
[SPEAKER_03]: comes with a certain amount of what they
call uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you have a certain amount of
uncertainty, that can make your,
[SPEAKER_03]: you release a result, you say that's 26%,
but actually it could be really between 24
[SPEAKER_03]: and 28%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this exists in every other industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It exists in pharmaceuticals, it exists in
environmental lab testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what we need to educate the
consumers, the cultivators a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: to say, hey, when you get a result,
the result, you know, we report it as
[SPEAKER_03]: this, but there is actually a swing from
here to here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really depends on everybody's
methodology, equipment, practices and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But every laboratory should have that
number calculated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it should be known to anybody who
is actually compliant with BCC and ISO
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in Colorado, the Department of
Public Health actually mediates an
[SPEAKER_04]: inter-lab proficiency test study.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of you are familiar with the
protocol, but there's a 13-page document
[SPEAKER_04]: that describes how the Department of
Public Health actually homogenizes flour
[SPEAKER_04]: and sends it out to the lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 13 pages just to make sure that the
sample is homogeneous.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot does go into it on the sampling
side, but you know, I do want to reinforce
[SPEAKER_04]: the idea of transparency.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're maybe a little too
aggressive with our clients as well in
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to bring them into our lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show them our methods, you know,
force them to look at our method
[SPEAKER_04]: validations to see our method uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because those are the types of things that
are going to, you know, bring awareness to
[SPEAKER_04]: the consumer end that those are the
questions that need to be asked on the lab
[SPEAKER_04]: side as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, method uncertainties is a
required calculation on the newest
[SPEAKER_02]: revision of ISO 17-025-2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something we've performed at
our lab, taken into account all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: different factors that may aid to
uncertainties.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, technician, pipetting,
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, it's not reported in
the COA due to various reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: For one, it's not required by the state,
but it can always be asked by our client
[SPEAKER_02]: what those uncertainty values are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, they're totally right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a wide range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of things factor into that apart
from your method uncertainties is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, statistical sampling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, when you get the complaints,
it would be from a client who sent one bot
[SPEAKER_02]: to one lab, one bot to another lab,
but there were two different samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can expect to get the same results
out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the spread of things like mycotoxins
or pesticides are not homogenous
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the plants if you do apply
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really difficult to say that,
you know, whether you can compare apples
[SPEAKER_02]: to apples in this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important for labs to
really work on not labs with industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: just think of statistical sampling,
homogeneity.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that play into what values you
get from the labs?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are you really offering up that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one way we see this difference is,
or one group that does it well is,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say, in terms of the emerald
testing, running that and sending to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, labs across the nation and
applying statistical analysis to the
[SPEAKER_02]: values that are reported.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the spread if we have a certain
homogenous sample that's sent through?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the factor to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be where to look.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are the labs really different from
each other apart from their method
[SPEAKER_02]: uncertainties, as opposed to just a
random, you know, sample that a client or
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody sent two different samples to two
different labs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I agree with everything that
was said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, collectively, this is all
called measurement uncertainty,
[SPEAKER_00]: as any said.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a term commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a term in analytical chemistry,
but not widely understood by the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as any said, it is an ISO 17025
requirement now to determine your
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement uncertainty for every analyte
you measure in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically, measurement uncertainty in
our lab for cannabinoids is 6%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not six points, so it's not like
20% versus 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 26%, it's .06 up that 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, in analytical chemistry,
a plus or minus 15% is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you are coming in with a 30% THCA
value, that means you should accept or
[SPEAKER_00]: expect a range of 27% to 33%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I have advocated since day
one in Nevada and I've probably said it in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, is that we should be reporting
ranges, not an absolute value,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of all of the components that add
up to your measurement uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also like to say that one of
the biggest contributors to the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between labs is which certified reference
standards they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: A colleague of mine, Brianna Cassidy,
who's the lab director at CDX Analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: in Massachusetts, did a comparison of five
different companies' certified reference
[SPEAKER_00]: standards for cannabinoids, and she found
a 17% difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can see right there, depending on
which reference standards your lab uses
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the one you are comparing it to,
that could alone account for the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the results.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you all touched on a very important
thing, and it's statistics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Statistics can be used to kind of even out
these results.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, a lot of labs right now are reporting
things as singular true values without
[SPEAKER_06]: reporting that actual measurement
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what do you think it will take for
labs to actually report within a range
[SPEAKER_06]: rather than a single true value?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take the regulators to allow
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to take some public
education to all of these clients that are
[SPEAKER_03]: getting the results that say, okay,
what does this range mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we interpret it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why aren't we doing a single number?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when it comes down to it,
people are using this number to value the
[SPEAKER_03]: product, and so they want to value it on a
single number, because it's easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, things don't work that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Science doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants don't work that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we have to educate all of the
consumers as to, okay, well, when you have
[SPEAKER_03]: a range, this is how you deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, you know, it's normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that should be anticipated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you have to account for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Saying 25% versus 26% is not significant
in any of the contexts that we're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about, yet a lot of cultivators and
dispensaries will use this as a price
[SPEAKER_03]: breaking point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, a lot of the industry on the
manufacturing side is moving towards GMP,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And part of GMP is producing a product to
specifications.
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifications obviously have a lower and
an upper limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so the concept of these
ranges, I think, is going to become more
[SPEAKER_04]: and more comfortable on the manufacturing
side, making it more acceptable for us to
[SPEAKER_04]: report it from the laboratory side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, luckily, I think over time,
this problem will probably take care of
[SPEAKER_04]: itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I agree that the regulators
have to be the one giving us the big
[SPEAKER_02]: initial push.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing more to add.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, it will be up to the
regulators, because if you look at it this
[SPEAKER_02]: way, if Lab A is giving a certain value
for a certain crop, and they additionally
[SPEAKER_02]: tested Lab B with a higher value,
well, the client tends to go with that Lab
[SPEAKER_02]: B of a certain higher percentage,
because, well, it's more value.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until the regulators can stop and ask
for reporting in a range based on your
[SPEAKER_02]: method uncertainties, this will not
change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another really important statistical thing
that you brought up, Savino, was kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: how things are sampled before they get to
the lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know in California, you were actually
required to send a sampler, and they have
[SPEAKER_06]: to follow the internal lab SOP and make
sure to get a statistically representative
[SPEAKER_06]: sample.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you just have a client that's
submitting one sample and trying to do an
[SPEAKER_06]: entire formulation on it, what would you
say to them in order to get the best
[SPEAKER_06]: statistically valid sample?
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you ask them to collect their
sample before it gets to your lab?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if it's a flower, I would ask them
to collect lots of different size buds
[SPEAKER_03]: from different parts of the plant,
or if it's already mixed up, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to select from different physical
locations in the batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it were a concentrate, I'd ask them to
heat it up and try to mix it and
[SPEAKER_03]: homogenize it as much as possible,
same with a liquid, and sample from
[SPEAKER_03]: different parts of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And have them realize, hey, this is as
representative a sample as we can get,
[SPEAKER_03]: but expect it to vary by this much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may vary by 10% to 15%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when making their formulations for
edibles, take that into account and not
[SPEAKER_03]: try to be at the very edge of what's
legally allowed, of the 10 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_03]: edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just realize, hey, there's a little bit of
a swing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you try to make all of them 10,
there's a possibility that one might come
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of an acceptable range.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would try to work with them and do
it multiple times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that they really get used to how to
sample, and how to properly submit them
[SPEAKER_03]: for testing, and then how to properly
formulate their final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, California has pretty set rules for
statistical sampling for compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes to R&D, you know,
it's up to the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally, what we've seen is people
make kilograms of oil, and they have in 15
[SPEAKER_02]: different jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they will bring you, you know,
a two-gram sample from one jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not representative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we usually get to each bottle,
sample from each bottle, homogeneously,
[SPEAKER_02]: and run that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what has happened many times is
you sample from one jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say for contaminants, it's,
you know, clear of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, because you've collected
different fractions through your run,
[SPEAKER_02]: certain fractions will have higher levels
of certain pesticide that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: was in the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you've just completely missed
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to compliance sampling,
now you're statistically sampling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Per California rules of about 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now things pop up that they miss in R
&D because they did not sample R&D
[SPEAKER_02]: representatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Nevada, the regulators tell us what
we can take, which is 12 grams per every
[SPEAKER_00]: five pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The labs do go out and do this,
collect the samples themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the site, we are supposed to just
take one gram from five pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what is analyzed for micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's very arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: How that came up was based on some
sampling document that somebody read about
[SPEAKER_00]: how they sample, you know, pill
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, we need to hear from
Colorado because I think Colorado finally
[SPEAKER_00]: came up with a good sampling strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have not mandatory sampling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, as the laboratory, almost never go
out into the field and do the sampling.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all in the manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, if I offer to go do the sampling,
I've never, never been taken up on it yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the samples that we get are pretty
interesting in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some sampling SOPs that are
pretty fantastic where you take 29 half
[SPEAKER_04]: gram samples from different points around
the harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's a flower harvest or a similar
statistical methods for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, almost nobody adheres to
those SOPs right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll still get my one very nice green
flower for potency and my one very nice
[SPEAKER_04]: brown flower for microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of pivoting a little bit,
I just want to bring us back to one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: core tenets of good science.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's collaboration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, to do good science,
you need to collaborate with different
[SPEAKER_06]: minds, different viewpoints, kind of see
problems from different perspectives and
[SPEAKER_06]: come together for a certain solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the lab testing industry,
it's a little bit hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: A, because you can't ship samples across
state lines because it's federally
[SPEAKER_06]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: B, because we're actually in competition
with each other rather than kind of on the
[SPEAKER_06]: same side from a business perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of in contrast with the spirit
of science.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think there are opportunities for
labs to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of labs just don't know
about them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So are there any ways in which you think
that collaboration would both help your
[SPEAKER_06]: business and help your science?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think collaboration would
absolutely help in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is being able to share data
about contamination, be able to share data
[SPEAKER_03]: about some of the interferences that
different instruments have with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying to find one pesticide in
particular cannabis strains with different
[SPEAKER_03]: instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be really beneficial for
some of these laboratories to share and
[SPEAKER_03]: avoid getting false positives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or false negatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as well, sharing chemical profile
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turpenes, cannabinoids, and whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because really, if we're really going to
understand this plant, we definitely need
[SPEAKER_03]: to look at this data in a big aggregated
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no one laboratory has enough data to
really make a significant set to really
[SPEAKER_03]: tell us something about the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So alone, these data sets aren't worth
very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But combined, I think they can do a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to figure out a way to
incentivize laboratories to share data and
[SPEAKER_03]: then share in whatever profits can
possibly come from that data.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 11, the numbers are fluctuating,
but we have 11 laboratories performing
[SPEAKER_04]: testing in Colorado at any time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have formed a non-profit organization,
actually, called the Colorado Lab Council,
[SPEAKER_04]: where all of the labs meet, usually on a
monthly basis, to discuss some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one way that we've kind of
organized a way that we can chat and keep
[SPEAKER_04]: the lines of communication open.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I personally don't believe that I'm in
competition with most of the labs out
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need them to exist myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't do it alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm in competition with is actually
just bad science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've asked a lot of our
competitors to actually come into our lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to our laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And asked to do the same of their
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so far, only four of the other
laboratories have taken us up on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But four is a lot better than zero,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So slowly, we're changing, I think,
the perception of collaboration and
[SPEAKER_04]: transparency in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, collaboration is very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a prime example is Heavy Metal's
talk that we just did with Kyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: CannaSafe kind of prides itself and is
wanting to do more of that in the future,
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborate with not just other labs,
but other scientific minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there's a few things that kind of
prevents data sharing or analysis of data,
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations from the different states.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, if we want to interpret
cannabinoid data, California requires
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture tests be added.
[SPEAKER_02]: So values are seemingly higher than maybe
Nevada that doesn't add moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or terpenes are using different
instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think until we kind of get to either a
compendium method or more open with our
[SPEAKER_02]: methodology, it'll be harder to evaluate
that data accordingly because of the minor
[SPEAKER_02]: differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it isn't very important in the
scientific industry, obviously,
[SPEAKER_02]: to share data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that data has to be accurate and
reproducible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to add that method
standardization helps that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as our methods become more
standardized, we're actually able to share
[SPEAKER_03]: that data because we're not trying to
protect an IP of a method where our IP is
[SPEAKER_03]: in the rest of the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, one thing we usually encourage
our clients, if they disagree with the
[SPEAKER_02]: data that I produce, I encourage them to
send it to another accredited lab that is
[SPEAKER_02]: trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've compared our values.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we looking at the same LOD?
[SPEAKER_02]: LODs, LOQs, instrumentation, similar
methodology, similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ask my clients to actually do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a way to kind of
bridge, start to collaborate slowly and
[SPEAKER_02]: start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody once said it's a coopetition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a very important phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A business, depending on where you're
located, can be very cutthroat and very
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been able to find collaborators
across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I have a very rich
experience because I have other lab
[SPEAKER_00]: directors that I can call up and discuss
certain issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, getting in a new edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every edible we get in is like a mini
research project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to first pry out of the producer
what they use to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we basically have to deconstruct
it and try and extract the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpene levels that they expect to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the lab business is not the
segment of the industry to be in if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to make a lot of money because
it's just not happening in the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think because of that, we're getting
a higher quality scientists involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scientists are just naturally curating
areas, and they do like to collaborate
[SPEAKER_00]: because science is a layer cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these different analytes we've
had to develop methods for, it works much
[SPEAKER_00]: better if you have collaborators to
discuss it with.
[SPEAKER_06]: So from a research standpoint,
you guys are actually in a unique
[SPEAKER_06]: position.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you're doing a federally
sanctioned study, you can only get raw
[SPEAKER_06]: material from one source.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you guys are actually getting things
from your state that are hitting the
[SPEAKER_06]: shelves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really high quality products, and
presumably clean if they're actually
[SPEAKER_06]: hitting the shelves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you think the labs have a certain
kind of advantage in ways they can
[SPEAKER_06]: research novel ideas and new products just
because you're getting so much of these
[SPEAKER_06]: into your labs?
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, any of you are doing the
research on heavy metals and vape.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really great pilot study.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what would you say to other labs to
encourage them to do things?
[SPEAKER_06]: Similar to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, getting beyond simply being
there to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, our scientists are here for the
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making money is a bonus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to get away from that mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cannabis, and maybe we don't care,
or maybe we're here to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not the case in my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We genuinely care, and we have fun while
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever look at an Instagram post,
we have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we care about the consumers and the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the idea, but I give credit to Kyle
and Robert who came to me with what they
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we collaborated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's being open to people that are
contacting you or seeing what's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a consumer safety risk?
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you study that would make a
difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the data that we collect in
the lab gives you an indication of what
[SPEAKER_02]: you can pursue next.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were getting in a lot of vape cart
failures in heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while something had to be done,
start to study what's going on with these
[SPEAKER_02]: vape carts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they failing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So ideas like that come up, and you kind
of pursue it and find some other brilliant
[SPEAKER_02]: minds to collaborate with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would say we've never had the
thought of competing with manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But our goal is more to assist the
regulators.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a pretty limited list of solvents
that we test for in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: But analytically, it's not much of a
challenge to look a little bit deeper.
[SPEAKER_04]: So part of the value in our data set is
actually providing that for the regulators
[SPEAKER_04]: and saying, hey, maybe ethyl acetate is
something we want to add to the list.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing it so often and at such
concentrations that it may be worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe there's another solvent that we
want to take off the list because we never
[SPEAKER_04]: see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we see our data set as being a little
more valuable in that manner that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of drive public health in the
direction that we want to see it go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to add to that that most
analytical laboratories, their main
[SPEAKER_03]: business is the product analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the time and money to do any kind
of outside research is very limited.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we cannot get to the extent that
you would see at a university or anything
[SPEAKER_03]: that had outside funding for their
research specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually, the chemists are trying to do
this in between trying to handle their
[SPEAKER_03]: clients and other samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that as the industry matures,
as competition kind of falls out and the
[SPEAKER_03]: main laboratory players survive,
they'll have a little bit more time and
[SPEAKER_03]: resources to dedicate to this research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we'll see more and more of
that as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will just say that having the
ability to conduct R&D studies for our
[SPEAKER_00]: clients and things of interest to us is
really what makes it palatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that Nevada does let us use
our retained product for R&D, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate use of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one tiny sliver of brightness
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you there are endless
number of experiments that could be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that's just on the horizon is
hemp testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of like what the cannabis
industry we hope will become in the
[SPEAKER_06]: future.
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now, the big kind of testing
consideration for hemp is that the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: material itself has to have less than 0.3%
THC on a dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is actually way more complicated
than people think it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what kind of technical considerations
do you undertake when you're testing hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: versus cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's pretty much the same methods as
you would test regular cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd make some alterations to the sample
prep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're very minor.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the big issue becomes is that these
regulations, and they say 0.3% THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: these were set years ago when gas
chromatography was the standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now that the industry has evolved
over the last 30 years, we need to go back
[SPEAKER_03]: and look at those and say, all right,
does that mean just 0.3% THC?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is that combined THC, THCA?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's how a lot of people go
about it, just to be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we really need to get clarification
and updates on those regulations to know
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly how we should go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a special topic for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm strongly advocating for the ability to
use molecular or genetic screening to
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguish industrial hemp from resin,
CBD hemp, and drug-type THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we've shown, we've actually
developed a molecular assay called True
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on two gene SNPs that can make
this distinction across these three
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tested over 500 samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have shown that what is being grown
in the US right now, that 68% of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: over 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the definition from the 2018 Farm Bill
is decarboxylated THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about delta 9 plus 0.87%
of THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is really shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't have to be an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drive down the road at 35 miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell that is resin CBD hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they look like little Christmas
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically look like marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not industrial hemp, which is
more like an erect stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is a critical issue for
the hemp industry, is that we get some
[SPEAKER_00]: alleviation from that strict 0.3% cutoff
for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually are seeing that a much more
reasonable cutoff is 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the state of Vermont has already
adopted the ability to use genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: screening as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just hoping that the federal
USDA, when they release their regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: will provide that alternative.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because from the testing we've done,
if you take a look, if you have dried
[SPEAKER_02]: flower of the so-called hemp, most of them
are over 0.3% when it's dried and ready
[SPEAKER_02]: for consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the CDPH, Department of Public Health
in California, set specific set of rules
[SPEAKER_02]: on how to test hemp here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And matter of fact, Canna Safe has been
testing a whole lot of compliance hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: lately from the farms here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's easier to be less than 0.3% when
you're taking into account the whole plant
[SPEAKER_02]: mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the CDPH says, OK, you have to dry this
hemp before testing to a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency till the mass stops changing,
essentially, and follow through the
[SPEAKER_02]: certain procedures.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you take the whole plant mass
with the stems and everything and the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves and test it, generally,
yeah, you'll be perfectly fine with less
[SPEAKER_02]: than 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you get a dried bud trimmed maybe
for smoking or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will find that it will be over
0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we deal with this arbitrary
number?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, it's still a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that reflects the older methodology
that they used to use for testing cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: that was seized by law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to just put the stems and seeds
and everything together, grind it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at a lot of the NIDA methods
from the 90s and 2000, they just ground
[SPEAKER_03]: everything up together, which is not how
anybody consumes it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we've been seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you get that value,
and testing by HPLC represents that acidic
[SPEAKER_02]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you'll have people asking,
well, can you run it by GC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, generally, people are not using GC
because you want to see the full profile
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it goes into what you were
saying before when you do use GC and grind
[SPEAKER_02]: everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's other considerations as
to whether you're actually accurately
[SPEAKER_02]: quantifying that THC with your GC inlet
and the revertation, whatever you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your results are much less efficient
than the 0.87 times THCA that they
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: It winds up being more like 0.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got time for, I think,
one last question.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something I personally wondered.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you guys think is the most
technically challenging part of cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: testing?
[SPEAKER_06]: And where do you think the greatest demand
for good scientists lies?
[SPEAKER_03]: In the states I've worked, no doubt,
the most technically challenging are the
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides because, basically,
you're looking for contamination that is a
[SPEAKER_03]: similar molecular weight to the actual
main ingredients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're looking for something in the
parts per billion range in noise that is
[SPEAKER_03]: way, way higher, thousands and thousands
of times higher than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that becomes a bit of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been a challenge in a lot of
different states.
[SPEAKER_03]: They set these pesticide levels really,
really low before actually testing to see
[SPEAKER_03]: whether they are actually possible with
instrumentation that's currently
[SPEAKER_03]: available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've seen this in Nevada as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took Captan off the list because the
state lab wasn't able to see it
[SPEAKER_03]: consistently down to the level at which
they demanded everybody else do it for the
[SPEAKER_03]: last three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of learning there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, to me, pesticides is the most
challenging, requires the most expensive
[SPEAKER_03]: instrumentation, the most extensive
instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the most sample prep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these guys can probably comment
on that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think the battle between wanting
to look as low as we can possibly look for
[SPEAKER_04]: public health versus achieving that in the
laboratory is never going to go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would think, in terms of someone who
I want on my team, communication to the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry is one of the most important
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oftentimes, in a competitive place,
if you fail somebody, they're going to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere else where they don't get a
fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So communicating that that's not a fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an opportunity to improve on their
manufacturing process is a delicate one
[SPEAKER_04]: and something that's not inherent to a lot
of scientists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely something that we try and be
really sensitive about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Cindy kind of touched it in
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the various matrices that you get
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never cease to be surprised in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is truly a low science project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each time, a week ago, we got a candle
land infused with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine a candle infused with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how are you really receiving the
benefits?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's besides the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then testing, elucidating the CBD from
this candle and all this, there's all
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts of excipients, all sorts of matrix
interferences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to go in on a low science
project, bring out the chemistry bug,
[SPEAKER_02]: go back into how can I extract my CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the midst of all these interferences
with compounds that are eluding at same
[SPEAKER_02]: retention time, same similar structures,
conflating results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we see everything from that,
toothpicks, suppository, gels,
[SPEAKER_02]: just name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never cease to be surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually is what keeps this industry
exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you never know what you're going
to get in the door that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a challenge on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's up to the most reputable labs or
thoroughly vetted labs to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: accurately extract and analyze these
compounds in these various matrices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could lead to having hundreds of
SOPs depending on what you get in the
[SPEAKER_02]: door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is not a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only are they infusing water,
but it's being encapsulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are certain encapsulations that
you have to break membranes to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: get at the molecule or even concentrate
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You imagine an 8 ounce or 16 ounce bottle
of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is 5 milligrams of CBD in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so somehow you have to concentrate
that extract from the membrane and report
[SPEAKER_02]: accurately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the challenges remain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what makes this work fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with all the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I even remember the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of challenging things
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when a state comes up with the list of
pesticides, so on the issue of pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: they come up with the list of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the pesticides the lab is going
to screen for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't use those pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 100 or 200 other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pesticide game is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Nevada, we are actually instructed,
if we see another pesticide not on the
[SPEAKER_00]: list, that we're supposed to say,
hey, we saw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually, for me, it's really
disappointing at the human level that
[SPEAKER_00]: growers are willing to use these
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we know they are neurotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that no one should be inhaling
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see them pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing that's really
annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's disappointing, this game that's
being played with regard to pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is because the value of
cannabis is based on its THC content,
[SPEAKER_00]: if a grower at some point got a 30% THCA
and we come back with 28, he will go lab
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get to your point, Stephen,
he'll go lab shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'll find a lab that will give him
what value he wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the frailty of human nature,
we see the same spectrum of personalities
[SPEAKER_00]: existing within the cannabis testing space
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a really interesting
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you go to a doctor and he tells
you you have a disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're like, I'll just go to a
different doctor and tells me I don't have
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just very strange.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, so we're short on time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to leave the rest of the time we
have to open up questions for the
[SPEAKER_06]: panelists.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to make your way to the
microphone, please do.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the meantime, let's give our
panelists a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you were the first one up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for this wonderful panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've been talking a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: The title of this panel is the future of
cannabis testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've talked a lot about measurement
uncertainty and different matrix types.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was curious what you think about what
labs might look like over the next 10
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think labs will start to
specialize?
[SPEAKER_05]: I could easily see a lab that only does
flour and concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a lab maybe that's also
registered with the FDA later testing
[SPEAKER_05]: mostly edible products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you speak about how you see cannabis
testing evolving over the next five to 10
[SPEAKER_05]: years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in every other industry,
you would see labs specializing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd see a lab specializing in doing
pesticide testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd see a lab specializing in doing this
and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you submit your stuff to a lab,
they could sub out to other laboratories.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you would see it in
environmental testing a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of states, especially California,
has specifically prohibited that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we'll see over the years
that's starting to change and having it
[SPEAKER_03]: start to mimic what we see in other
industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the ways labs can distinguish
themselves is by offering other value
[SPEAKER_04]: added tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you'll start to see a lot of
diversification that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some labs that will do lipidomics,
some labs that will do full smoke and
[SPEAKER_04]: vapor testing, and everything down the
line there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it becomes federally legal,
it essentially will be necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no other industry where
you're forced to use all this different
[SPEAKER_02]: instrumentation in one space and still
report those results within two days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll see centralized lab testing
because the way it's set up now,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really rather absurd that at a
minimum, you need $2 million just for the
[SPEAKER_00]: basic instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spectrum of tests that have to be
carried out is extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So centralized testing, I think we'll also
see an expansion of genotyping testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at DigiPath, we do a lot of
genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do SNP analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as growers want to protect their IP or
defend the fact that this really is Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream, they'll be more mandatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandatory genotyping, I believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, our left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Kira.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two quick questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the state of California specifically,
it states in the BCC that we have to take
[SPEAKER_01]: up to 32 increments whenever you're
sampling a large batch of flour up to 50
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistically, are you looking at this 50
pound batch after you've confirmed that it
[SPEAKER_01]: is indeed 50 pounds and taking 32
increments where we have this competition
[SPEAKER_01]: between labs that you only only see them
taking 11 grams to 13 grams in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: complete a full panel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you do have to take those
increments.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lab should be recording those
increments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you're not necessarily going to weigh
their 50 pounds because you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: carrying that scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to rely on the track and trace
system such as metric that they are
[SPEAKER_02]: following those rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't police all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to take those increments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really need that mass,
based on what the BCC has now required,
[SPEAKER_02]: half gram minimum sample mass for each
analytical test.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find that you'll quickly run out of
that half mass, especially if you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: do replicate analysis, which have to be in
duplicate and have to concur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they don't concur, you have to
repeat that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a lab is not taking the required
amount, well, it's bad news for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second question really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you all look for inside of a
compliance officer for your laboratory?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some consultants are saying that
compliance is not science, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely absurd.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes no sense inside of an analytical
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've also seen the other spectrum
where the compliance officer is a full PhD
[SPEAKER_01]: statistician modeling algorithms for
diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their communication style isn't
necessarily the best either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would be your sweet spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: For your compliance officer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you definitely want someone who has
experience either doing compliance for a
[SPEAKER_03]: laboratory or working or running a
laboratory to the degree that they were
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves tracking all of this
information that's required to be tracked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You definitely need some science literacy
to be able to do this or either that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you have just compliance experience,
you need a lot of training to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: fully comprehend all of this data that's
coming through and then check it every
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as a compliance officer,
you're going to be checking every single
[SPEAKER_03]: result that goes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And trying to catch mistakes that either
the director didn't catch or the
[SPEAKER_03]: technician.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're playing devil's advocate on
you're pretending to be the state and
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, OK, if I were going through this,
what would I try to point out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are all the possible mistakes that
could have happened here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, it's very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can't say we have more than one
compliance officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need a high level person.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about the state requires
that you produce a data packet per sample
[SPEAKER_02]: that you produce out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the data packet includes
chromatograms, your raw data, your bench
[SPEAKER_02]: sheets, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have this essentially 100 page
packet per sample that you receive in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a lab that tests over 100 samples
a day, you can imagine what kind of work
[SPEAKER_02]: that takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need a team and not just any Joe
from the street being your compliance
[SPEAKER_02]: officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we only have time for one more
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Christian Saucier.
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is, we've heard over the last
two days a lot of call outs for more
[SPEAKER_07]: collaboration across competitors.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've heard a lot of questions about data,
and more specifically, even across
[SPEAKER_07]: borders.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of this is relevant to clinical
research, obviously.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are potentially more on the
consumer side.
[SPEAKER_07]: But are your labs involved?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you seeing any sort of meaningful
industry-wide effort for third party,
[SPEAKER_07]: independent third party, obviously,
to help collaborate all this that can help
[SPEAKER_07]: you aggregate once and while you retain
ownership of it, but help you as labs to
[SPEAKER_07]: aggregate your data together so we can do
proper analytics in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we certainly are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we ourselves have published two or
three papers on large data sets where
[SPEAKER_00]: we've analyzed the cannabinoid content
versus the terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, the terpene profiles are
way more informative than the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a third party, companies like
Leafly, or even
[SPEAKER_00]: Confident Cannabis, they're making efforts
on comparing data sets across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, even the Emerald tests when they
do these blinded tests where they send out
[SPEAKER_00]: blinded samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see where you come in across
all of your peers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have the median and the
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so little snippets of data like that
are incredibly informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the barriers to combining and
compiling all of this data from different
[SPEAKER_00]: labs is the fact that we're using
different certified reference standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dealing with this confusion of
strain naming, where growers will change
[SPEAKER_00]: the name of the strain from when you pick
up the sample before you get back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so strain names don't necessarily have
as much meaning as they may have at one
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the importance and need to move
toward incorporation of genetic testing
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of these samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the effort is happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think the market is starting
to demand it more and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're starting to see demands from
cultivators, manufacturers to sort of get
[SPEAKER_03]: together and see, OK, how can you make
your methods be more similar such that the
[SPEAKER_03]: data can be aggregated such that if we
take something from here and test it here
[SPEAKER_03]: and here, that the results will be not
exactly the same, but at least within a
[SPEAKER_03]: reasonable swing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it'll happen more and more as
the industry grows and as everybody's data
[SPEAKER_03]: set gets kind of bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you have larger companies,
corporations that until now haven't been
[SPEAKER_03]: getting into cannabis because of the
federal ban on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see them get into banking now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll have their bank accounts will be
able to get into this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'll be able to purchase these
data sets or at least work with these
[SPEAKER_03]: other laboratories to learn what they
learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once there is a financial incentive,
I think you'll see a lot more people
[SPEAKER_03]: collaborating.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's all the time we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't keep you from lunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: But ladies and gentlemen, our panelists,
give them a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
