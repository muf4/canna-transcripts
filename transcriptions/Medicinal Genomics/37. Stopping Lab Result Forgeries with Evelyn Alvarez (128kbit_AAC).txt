[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you probably already know by now,
but after careful evaluation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: current situation in Los Angeles County,
and the restrictions and requirements that
[SPEAKER_00]: would have been necessary to hold CanMed
2021 in September, our management team has
[SPEAKER_00]: made the difficult decision to reschedule
the event from May 3rd through 5th,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not an easy decision to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been almost two years since we had a
live CanMed event, but everyone,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the conference organizers,
our sponsors, and the presenters,
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly believe that in order for CanMed
to be a success, it must take place in a
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable, collaborative environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just not possible during these
uncomfortable and restrictive times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will press on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue to bring you new podcasts
every other week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue to interact with the
CanMed community on our Facebook group,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will continue to share all the
great CanMed presentation videos that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in our free, searchable CanMed archive on
all of our social media channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find links to all those great
resources in the show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you have not signed up for
email alerts yet, you really should.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the best way to stay up to date
with all the updates around the CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference delivered right to your inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, on to today's guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the pleasure of speaking with Evelyn
Alvarez, the Quality Assurance Director at
[SPEAKER_00]: Encore Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evelyn has 10 years of experience working
on analytical instrumentation and in
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated lab environments, including work
on EPA and OSHA methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: She received a degree in environmental
science with research experience on
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evelyn was recently quoted in a Refinery29
article that revealed an unfortunate
[SPEAKER_00]: element of the unregulated Delta VIII THC
market, that being that some Delta VIII
[SPEAKER_00]: THC producers will falsify lab results
also known as certificates of analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: that they post online.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cover that topic and others in our
discussion, including how COAs differ from
[SPEAKER_00]: state mandated compliance tests,
how the lack of regulatory oversight of
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta VIII THC products puts consumers at
risk, red flags consumers can look for
[SPEAKER_00]: when reviewing COAs online, the recent
increase in Delta VIII THC products,
[SPEAKER_00]: how the process of synthesizing Delta VIII
THC from hemp may introduce contaminants
[SPEAKER_00]: that most labs are not testing for,
and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Evelyn, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Encore Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encore Labs is the premier cannabis
testing facility licensed in California
[SPEAKER_00]: with ISO IEC 17-025 certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer statewide comprehensive
analysis to cultivators, infused product
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers, distributors, providers,
and dispensaries, not only for regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, but also to characterize the
unique aspects of your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encore Labs is also a bronze sponsor for
CanMed 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2022, which we very much appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information, go to Encore-Labs
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Evelyn
[SPEAKER_00]: Alvarez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Evelyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very excited to talk about these very
important topics for consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were quoting in a pretty wild
article that came out last month on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website, Refinery29.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find the story concerning in a lot of
ways, but let's just start, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the general premise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if you want to kind of
explain how you got involved in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this or if you want to do that first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll jump into some of the
concerns that it raises.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so a while back, we got an email to
our lab, and Molly, the journalist from
[SPEAKER_01]: Refinery29, was reaching out, initially
just asking some very straightforward
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about Delta A product that she
was going to write a review piece on.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started digging into the sample
information, I realized that the reports
[SPEAKER_01]: were very clearly fabricated, just
completely made up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I reached back out to her with that
information, she was pretty blown away as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just kind of started a good back
and forth between her and I, which ended
[SPEAKER_01]: up turning into this great piece by her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she really went down the rabbit's
bowl and spoke to many different people in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry, from researchers to
regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned into be a good highlight for
everyone, for consumers, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, Molly had taken this Delta A
THC gummy and had a pretty intense
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: More intense than she was expecting or
that was advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she went to the website and looked
at the COA that was listed there,
[SPEAKER_00]: as many of these products have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she looked at it, everything looked
good, less than 0.3%, THC, no residual
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents, everything looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she goes one step further and actually
reaches out to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: How common is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do consumers actually reach out to your
lab to confirm a COA that they see online?
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to Delta A, not very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that Delta A products have become more
and more popular, we've gotten a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: inquiries to our line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good that people are asking those
questions, that there unfortunately is
[SPEAKER_01]: fabrication out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's unfortunately not enough education
about what these products are and what
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, if any, that there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more that people can call in and
ask us questions, we're happy to help
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially relay the data to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't go into safety in terms of the
physician's end of things, but we can
[SPEAKER_01]: interpret the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so I guess before we get too deep
into it, can you briefly explain sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: what a COA is and why is it important for
cannabis users and patients in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: product safety?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so COA, simply put, is a summary of
the results of testing performed on the
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So COA stands for certificate of analysis,
depending on the number of tests
[SPEAKER_01]: requested, it can tell you a lot about a
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cannabinoid profile, how potent it
is, how much THC or CBD is in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We test for a lot of harmful things,
things like pesticides, heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_01]: residual solvents, microbials,
mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those are important in terms of
safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we detect one of those harmful
compounds, you shouldn't be consuming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the potency profile alone is super
important for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are purchasing these CBD or
Delta-8 products, how do they really know
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's what is in the product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how do they know that it doesn't
contain Delta-9 THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of situations where people
consume CBD products and then end up
[SPEAKER_01]: failing the drug test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if they would have gone one step
further to look for the report,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could have helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even more importantly for patients
that are trying to dose, if they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that what is labeled on the
container is actually what it contains so
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can have accurate dosing for
whatever it is that they're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: These COAs that the manufacturers put up
on their websites, it seems like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that they're testing for is
similar to what you would do for
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance testing for products that are
on a dispensary shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really the same battery of tests
that are done for these COAs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it depend on what the manufacturer
requests?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the differences between the two
types of tests?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very important question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on what they are
requesting for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For compliance testing here in the state
of California, there are very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations that we follow, really from
the beginning of testing to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How the sample arrives to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a compliance sample, we are required
to send one of our trained samplers out to
[SPEAKER_01]: the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are required to sample something that
is unbiased and representative.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of other requirements,
say the larger the batch size is,
[SPEAKER_01]: the larger sample we pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even just getting to the lab, a compliance
one is something that we picked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We refer to noncompliance samples as R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like CBD and Delta 8 that are
submitted, those don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manufacturers can send them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can drop them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can cherry pick if they still wish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unfortunate, but they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the get-go, you're getting something
potentially different than what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: buying because of how it was submitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it gets to the lab, that was a great
question that you asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of testing is performed?
[SPEAKER_01]: For compliance testing, we perform the
whole gambit that the state requires.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what I mentioned earlier,
pesticides, micro toxins, heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, for these noncompliance tests,
it's whatever the manufacturer requests.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're only concerned about an amino
profile, that is the only thing that we
[SPEAKER_01]: test because they have no requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it did have something harmful,
since we're not testing for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's really no way for that to be
communicated to anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides that, sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, even if that were requested
by the manufacturer, say micro toxins or
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals or something like that,
if you report that back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer, is there any mechanism for
that to be reported also to some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator or anyone to make sure that that
product still doesn't make it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, like I assume is in place for
compliance testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, another huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no requirement for that
information to be submitted anywhere else
[SPEAKER_01]: than to the person that requested it or
anything that is noncompliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our compliance results, the state has
really specific regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we finish and approve the results,
we're required to simultaneously report it
[SPEAKER_01]: to the distributor, the people who
submitted and requested the testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the state of California, the department
of cannabis control, and we have to upload
[SPEAKER_01]: it to a system, a track and trace system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in California, we use metric and all
of that keeps digital data for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if this distributor tried to transfer
it elsewhere, say to a retail shop,
[SPEAKER_01]: they won't be able to do that because
those failed results are stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even so, since we notified the department
of cannabis control, they're already going
[SPEAKER_01]: to take action on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For these noncompliance samples,
those manufacturers really aren't required
[SPEAKER_01]: to do much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're good actors and they're
going to go back and mediate their batch
[SPEAKER_01]: and submit again for testing and then sell
the product, but maybe they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to submit a different
sample and still push it through
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned earlier, the fact that
they can submit samples that may not
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly be representative of an entire
batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's really no way of knowing
that what you're buying is what was tested
[SPEAKER_01]: for anything that's not in these state
regulated areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you mentioned when I
asked how common it was for consumers to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually contact you to verify results of
a COA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it was more common now with
Delta-8-THC, yet I know that COAs have
[SPEAKER_00]: been in place for CBD products in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it about the Delta-8-THC products
that are causing more red flags,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine it is because of the mild
psychoactive properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say you bought CBD gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not necessarily get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have some feeling, but probably
nothing that's concerning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what happened with Delta-8 is it's
very new, so people don't know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very new on the manufacturing end,
so you also might be getting something
[SPEAKER_01]: that you weren't expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people are having a psychoactive
reaction that they didn't expect,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is more cause for concern of like,
what did I just take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me dig into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, a lot of the times the
product we get are after the fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: not before.
[SPEAKER_01]: After they've consumed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often are those inquiries,
does it come up that they may have used a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that had a fake COA or one that's
been modified?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it increasingly common?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say increasingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even for the common, for the number of
calls that we get, it actually hasn't been
[SPEAKER_01]: as common.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, I also don't know how
many people go to that extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone may buy a product, look up the
report, find it, and think, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: this looks fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be a lot out there that we
just don't know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, you encourage people to
reach out to you to confirm these results,
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it becoming overwhelming?
[SPEAKER_01]: On some days we do get a good amount of
calls, but we definitely do not want to
[SPEAKER_01]: cut that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a cannabis testing lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just going to hide behind our
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess to that end, are there any red
flags or maybe warning signs that people,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they are looking into a COA for a
product that they had maybe a strange or
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected experience with, are there some
indicators they can be looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a bit of a tough question because
to the trained eye, like me and our staff,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can quickly tell what's what.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the main points that I want to
pass on is most COAs have pictures of
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pull up a COA and the product that
you have in hand does not match what is on
[SPEAKER_01]: the report, that is a huge red flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already they're just slapping on a QR code
to a different product, assuming that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to go to the extent of
scanning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even on the pictures, we take the pictures
in our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take some nice pictures, but don't
expect a marketing photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: To end up on a report that comes from our
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has a fancy background, that's going
to be a red flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take very simple pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned QR code.
[SPEAKER_01]: QR codes are not only on products,
but we also put QR codes on our reports
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of other labs do as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This helps a lot because if you scan the
QR code on the report, it actually takes
[SPEAKER_01]: you to the website that we use to host our
reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're pulling up a report,
if you're scanning a QR code and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: taking you to some random website that
doesn't pair up to what is on the report,
[SPEAKER_01]: that could be a red flag as well because
that means they've probably downloaded it,
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly changed something, uploaded it
elsewhere because they can't upload
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to our site.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only what we upload ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is missing a QR code, that could be
a red flag as well, depending on where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, it's a lot of minuscule
differences that would be more so caught
[SPEAKER_01]: by us than anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but the one with the fact that the
report is most likely going to be hosted
[SPEAKER_00]: on the lab's website, that I think is a
pretty good indicator right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a PDF uploaded to the
manufacturer's website, that's probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more concerning than if it's going
to EncoreLabs.com, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: It may or may not be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some do download it and re-upload it very
directly without changing everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's say they did do that and you
scan the QR code.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it still goes back to our
hosting website, that would be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the one that you're looking at
on their website isn't any different than
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that's on our website,
that would be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a LIMS system that's called
Confident Cannabis and here in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually across the nation, a good amount
of labs use that website as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a common one that you would see
reports on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a bit about Delta 8 THC
specifically too because you did mention
[SPEAKER_00]: that folks are still not really familiar
with how these products are manufactured
[SPEAKER_00]: and how the differences in how they're
manufactured could introduce other
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could start maybe
briefly explaining what the process is for
[SPEAKER_00]: creating these products and then you can
go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have hands-on experience with this
part, more so just on the testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just very briefly, they're not
extracting it from the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not enough Delta 8 naturally
occurring in the hemp plant to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction like would be normal for CBD or
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is actually being done is CBD
isolate, which has had an overstock
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the hemp legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking the CBD isolate and they're
introducing a catalyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times, it's a combination of
acid, solvents, and heat and they are
[SPEAKER_01]: converting CBD into Delta 8 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an isomerization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess in general, how do Delta 8 THC
products compare to the more dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: grade products that you test in your lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I saw one article recently out
there and someone was calling some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these Delta 8 THC products bathroom gin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that you're seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they compare to things that are
coming from the regulated market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, because they don't have all
of the required testing, we don't have as
[SPEAKER_01]: much data points.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is ignorance is bliss.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have solvents, but since they're
not required to do all this testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have those data points.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of cannabinoid potency,
we have some pretty consistent products
[SPEAKER_01]: that we see with 90 plus potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean to say by that is if we have
an oil that is coming from a Delta 8
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridge, we're seeing that it has
greater than 90% of only Delta 8 THC in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, which is pretty comparable to some
of the Delta 9 THC products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a good amount of gummies and a good
amount are hitting the targets that are
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visibly, a gummy looks like a gummy
overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's really difficult for the
consumer is that Delta 8 THC as a primary
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid is new.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effects are different from person to
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that needs to be studied
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep coming back to just the
process of synthesizing Delta 8 THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: how that can just introduce all these
other residual solvents or other compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that you wouldn't traditionally see if you
were doing just a straight extraction of
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occurring compounds in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a lot of these
manufacturers aren't even going as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: what's commonly performed on products in
California to maybe even capture those
[SPEAKER_00]: additional compounds that come with the
process of creating Delta 8 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little concerning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another key point to make on that is the
testing that we perform is based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: California regulations, which were based
on the knowledge of historical THC
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These lists that they create, especially
for solvents, we're looking for butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very common extraction solvent,
but what is common for Delta 8 THC is
[SPEAKER_01]: still being figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different extraction
methods that are being tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if we test for residual solvents with
that California list, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: encompass all of the potential solvents
that they could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole Delta 8 THC thing really
concerns me just because I feel like there
[SPEAKER_00]: are so many great growers, manufacturers
in the regulated space that have all these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory hoops that they need to jump
through and are doing things the right
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gained a lot of trust in the
marketplace for people to trust cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have this new compound that's
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks aren't not testing for the things
that they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worry that they're going to erode the
public trust a little bit with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products because they're not doing things
the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would definitely agree with all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not to say that there aren't
companies that have good manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: practices and that are doing a good amount
of testing and have transparency.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of bad actors that are
completely taking advantage of this
[SPEAKER_01]: seemingly gray area that's up for
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple states have already taken action
outlawed and we'll have to see what the
[SPEAKER_01]: continuing regulatory landscape turns into
for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess another thing to worry about is
even if Delta 8 becomes outlawed or
[SPEAKER_01]: included in regulatory schemes,
who's to say that the next cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't going to become the next trend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 10 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't really have to see how this
evolves.
[SPEAKER_01]: On our end, the main thing for consumers
is continue to ask about testing from the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Continue to push for that because if
there's no regulatory push, then it has to
[SPEAKER_01]: come from the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's unfortunate that some
states have taken to banning Delta 8 THC
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of what you suggested,
maybe bundling it in or including it with
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal market and letting these,
like we've said, these established
[SPEAKER_00]: operators who are operating within the
regulated market, making sure that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the ones that are bringing these
Delta 8 THC products to market instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: these new actors who may be just trying to
make a buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, not to say that there
aren't some good ones out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at least it seems to me as a consumer,
a potential consumer, it's hard for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to suss out who are the good and
the bad actors if folks are doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing with the COAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just in general, with Delta 8 THC
testing, how much has that grown in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past 12 months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it seems like it's really exploded
as of recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it has.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely hasn't taken over a majority
of our testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really still focus on our compliance
testing and supporting R&D testing that
[SPEAKER_01]: supports that compliance testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a year ago, if you asked us about
Delta 8 THC, it was a minor cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: that occasionally came up because someone
didn't treat their normal THC distillate
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we're seeing a good variety of
products come through that are solely for
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some days we see 10% to 15% of our R&D
testing is solely from Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe this is a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're coming up to the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you could tell us a bit about
Encore Labs, what you guys do and how
[SPEAKER_00]: people can learn more about you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are a licensed cannabis testing lab
here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different states obviously have different
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has become legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in California, you have to be licensed
to test for these compliance tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are ISO accredited as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a big thing for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to educate the consumers on the
differences between ISO accredited labs
[SPEAKER_01]: and non ISO accredited labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to go through an accreditation
process that encompasses a huge list of
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have met that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking at a COA,
that is actually another thing to look
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the testing labs being used ISO
accredited?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they licensed by your state?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not, then there could be more
questions on the lab producing the
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are located in Pasadena,
California, and we feel like we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: very strategic location for the cannabis
testing lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are located in the cannabis
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been here since 2018 and have really
grown with our experience and with our
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're always looking for opportunities
to educate consumers and to partner up
[SPEAKER_01]: with different companies to push for
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're located in Pasadena,
California, which is where I came at
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great that we're very happy to
have you guys on board as a bronze
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you're looking to partner
with companies that are looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: educate, you've come to the right place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right, Evelyn, thank you so much
for taking the time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we're really looking
forward to seeing the team out there in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pasadena for CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reach out to Encore if you have
questions.
