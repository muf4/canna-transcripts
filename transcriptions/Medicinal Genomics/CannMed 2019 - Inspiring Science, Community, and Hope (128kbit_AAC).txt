[SPEAKER_00]: We're still very much in the stone ages in
terms of our understanding of the science
[SPEAKER_00]: behind the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of actual research we have the
tools but we don't necessarily have other
[SPEAKER_02]: people to collaborate with and that's what
CanMed is really important for.
[SPEAKER_01]: CanMed does a really good job of
incorporating the science and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: community addressing community interests,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like public safety, public health,
testing, efficacy for medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's really turned into a forum
that is credible but also diverse.
Thank you very much.
