[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head over to canmedevents.com now to learn
all about our CanMed 2021 event that will
[SPEAKER_00]: take place September 29th through October
1st at the Pasadena Convention Center in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pasadena, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be sure to get your tickets today at
the special early bird rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're at canmedevents.com,
be sure to sign up for email alerts to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay up to date with all the news
surrounding this industry-leading event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this episode, we have a few
announcements before I introduce this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the Cannabis Center of Excellence,
Medicinal Genomics, and the UMass
[SPEAKER_00]: Dartmouth Charlton College of Business
recently announced the formulation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare provider knowledge,
attitudes, practices related to medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis research study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intention of this study is to collect
information from healthcare providers in
[SPEAKER_00]: both the United States and Canada about
their experiences with medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and their practices, prior education
around the topic, and interest in future
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical education related to medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a healthcare provider,
we invite you to take part in this short
[SPEAKER_00]: 15-minute survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your personal information will not be
collected and as part of the study,
[SPEAKER_00]: one lucky participant will win a full
conference plus medical practicum pass to
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the link in the show description
to go directly to the survey or visit
[SPEAKER_00]: cannacenterofexcellence.org for more
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, we are encouraged to see that the
local Southern California governments
[SPEAKER_00]: announced last week that COVID cases are
at an all-time low and as a result,
[SPEAKER_00]: their widest reopenings are still on the
horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leading up to CanMed 2021, this is great
news and a sign that we are trending
[SPEAKER_00]: towards normalcy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, CanMed and Medicinal Genomics
will continue to monitor reopening
[SPEAKER_00]: policies with various state officials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, if you are a Facebook user and you
have not yet joined our CanMed community
[SPEAKER_00]: group, you're missing out on some great
discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little over 250 members in the
group who share articles, post polls,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask questions related to cannabis
science, medicine, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: safety testing, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way for the community to stay
engaged throughout the year and a great
[SPEAKER_00]: way to stay up to date with news related
to those topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which brings me to today's guest,
Dr. Greg Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Gerdeman is a neuroscientist and
educator with experience in the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological actions of cannabis and the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, Greg has gotten involved in the
conversation around Delta 8 THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is how I met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coincidentally enough, we met through the
CanMed community Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I explained how that happened at the top
of the interview, so I won't retell that
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the takeaway is that you can meet some
very interesting people in that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll stop plugging the Facebook
group down and get back to Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes at the Delta 8 THC topic from a
neuroscientist perspective, questioning
[SPEAKER_00]: how much we know about Delta 8 THC and how
it affects the body and the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also raises important questions about
how the compound is created and what that
[SPEAKER_00]: means for consumer safety and the legality
of Delta 8 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our conversation, we discussed what
exactly is Delta 8 THC and how does it
[SPEAKER_00]: differ from other THC isomers,
why there is a sudden influx of Delta 8
[SPEAKER_00]: THC products, how the 2018 farm bill
opened the door for Delta 8 THC
[SPEAKER_00]: production, the process for creating Delta
8 THC from CBD isolate and the risks
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with it, whether Delta 8 THC is
actually produced in the plant and at what
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, what research has been done to
understand how Delta 8 THC affects users,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Greg, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Project CBD is a California-based
nonprofit dedicated to providing
[SPEAKER_00]: up-to-date news and information on the
science, movement, and industry around
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, medical cannabis, and plant-based
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since its founding in 2010, Project CBD
has been a trusted resource for patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical professionals, scientists,
and like-minded advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more about Project CBD at projectcbd
.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
and I apologize for the additional ado
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode, I bring you my conversation
with Dr. Greg Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to talk with you today
about a topic that's been popping up a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: lately in the news, Delta 8 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Martin Lee, our friend over at
Project CBD, recently shared an article on
[SPEAKER_00]: our CanMed community Facebook group called
The Delta 8 THC Controversy, and does a
[SPEAKER_00]: great job describing this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, that article is going to serve as
a foundation for our conversation today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage people to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a link in the show description so
people can read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg, you were quoted in that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coincidentally enough, I had a question
about one of the comments you made,
[SPEAKER_00]: made a comment on the post, and you
responded to it right on the CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: community Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shameless plug for that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: People should definitely join that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, you can communicate with a
lot of leaders in the space and make some
[SPEAKER_00]: great connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'll put a link in the show
description for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'll stop rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into that question that I asked
a little bit later, but I think we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: really start with the basics here for
people who aren't familiar with Delta 8
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pass that over to you,
Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain to us a bit what it is and
why is it in the news lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's especially in the news that is
generated by and about the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, but it is going to be in broader
news.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that everyone needs to
take serious because there are risks and
[SPEAKER_01]: issues related to how this could affect
health and the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is Delta 8 THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone is familiar with Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the workhorse psychoactive component
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: For decades, Delta 9 THC was considered
the only active principle because that was
[SPEAKER_01]: the state of affairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the 60s, when Delta 9 THC was
isolated, it was found to replicate all
[SPEAKER_01]: the important behavioral and psychological
effects of hash oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other cannabinoids were discovered back
then, including Delta 8, but were not
[SPEAKER_01]: believed to have that kind of potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 8 THC is an isomer of Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a very similar chemical structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: To say it's an isomer means it has the
same number of carbons and other atoms,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's a difference in one bond
between two carbons in the molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: The position of that double bond is in
these different deltas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 9 has it in one place, Delta 8 has
it next door, and there are other isomers,
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 6, Delta 7, Delta 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: All it means is the placement of that bond
shifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is not a very impressive change just
looking at the molecule, but it does have
[SPEAKER_01]: some functional differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the next question is, where is Delta
8 coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has long been known that Delta 8 can be
seen in analyzed extracts of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there, it's found naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also discovered way back in the 60s
that Delta 9 and even CBD could change to
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 8 THC under certain chemical
conditions, especially low pH acid
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been known for many years that,
for example, CBD can convert to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what's happening right now
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 8 THC is being lab synthesized.
[SPEAKER_01]: This reaction to create Delta 8 from CBD
has been developed in different labs and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's being created from CBD isolate as a
starting product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that making enough sense for how we're
going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is making sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we know kind of what it is,
why is it popping up so much in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at two watershed moments here that
have caused this Delta 8 to pop up at the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer end in the form of gummies and
other edibles and vape cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have concentrated D8 that they're
doing like dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, in 2018 there was the farm
bill, there was a version of farm bill
[SPEAKER_01]: that was written in past to really help
advance a legalized hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we've got this long,
you know, winding relationship with what
[SPEAKER_01]: we call cannabis and hemp is now legally
defined based on its THC content and it
[SPEAKER_01]: has to be 0.3% Delta 9 THC or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it is, it's considered hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the 2018 farm bill hemp is not a
controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that farm bill did several things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing is it opened a real rush of
interest into growing hemp, extracting
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp, creating CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a rush for that and it was
overproduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was overgrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of farmers got nowhere near the
return they hoped.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of extraction companies had far more
competition than they thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a glut of CBD on the market and
the price of CBD fell dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had a situation where folks
investing and going into this hemp extract
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD industry, suddenly you saw their
margins shrinking dramatically because the
[SPEAKER_01]: price of CBD isolate was falling so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at the same time, the farm bill,
when it said that hemp is not a controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: substance, the language of that bill,
which many people have dug into says that
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts and isomers and derivatives
thereof, extracts and derivatives of
[SPEAKER_01]: legally defined hemp are also considered
hemp and therefore unscheduled,
[SPEAKER_01]: removed from the DEA's purview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it also says that it
synthetically, synthetic cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetically manufactured cannabinoids,
I forget what the exact language was,
[SPEAKER_01]: was not made legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: By this, and this is where there's a lot
of tension, but these two things,
[SPEAKER_01]: to answer your question, these two factors
converged where the price of CBD fell like
[SPEAKER_01]: a stone and there was a legal loophole
that made some enterprise and chemists
[SPEAKER_01]: realize, hey, CBD is cheap now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll buy hundreds of kilos of it and we
can start working in the lab to convert it
[SPEAKER_01]: to THC, Delta A THC, which isn't Delta C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta nine, so if we come up with a Delta
eight product that has less than 0.3%
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta nine, it'll be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also does get you high and it has
effects that have consumer value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the price of CBD dropping and this
perceived legal loophole that says if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not Delta nine, it's fair game led to this
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It led to this development and it led to a
return of really high profit margins for
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are pursuing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that drove an explosion of entry into
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are dozens and dozens of labs that
are buying cheap CBD isolate and making
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta eight products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it is a huge regulatory vacuum
right now, these products are popping up
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere, vape stores, gas stations,
hemp shops, certainly online direct sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's part of the issue too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That these products are popping up
everywhere from any number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers, not all of whom are
probably reputable or knowledgeable in
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can the consumers sort of tell the
difference or at least protect themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: if, like you said, there is that
regulatory vacuum?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to me, the real issue is pretty
much that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be honest, I mean, the end consumer at a
vape shop or another retail outlet,
[SPEAKER_01]: they generally have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can see that I've seen Delta
eight products with really slick,
[SPEAKER_01]: clean looking packaging and branding that
is very dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's my concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by dirty, I mean, I'm not out on a
crusade against Delta eight THC molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been a very limited clinical
experience with it, but Delta eight THC
[SPEAKER_01]: was stuck in the early 90s in a small
clinical trial for kids with pediatric
[SPEAKER_01]: cancers and were undergoing chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this small study, Delta eight THC
was very well tolerated and helped them
[SPEAKER_01]: through the nausea of their chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a potential therapeutic use.
[SPEAKER_01]: No surprise, because Delta nine and CBD
both have good anti-nausea effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my concern is what else is in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go to a lab, you can send your
product to a lab testing company and get a
[SPEAKER_01]: certificate of analysis, a COA,
that people in the field are very familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can test it and see here,
here are the cannabinoids that are
[SPEAKER_01]: present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are maybe terpenes if they're looking
at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality control issues like residual
solvents and pesticides and metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can test for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lab doesn't test for, I mean,
doesn't show you things that they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are, in these Delta eight
products, a variety of molecules that you
[SPEAKER_01]: see if you're looking at the raw data on
these lab analyses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of components in there,
reaction products that are unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a concern for the risk of
unknown molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unknown products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this comes to another real for me crux
of the issue that I think is sort of an
[SPEAKER_01]: existential moment in the hemp cannabis
industry about how we relate to this
[SPEAKER_01]: balance between natural or created within
the plant and lab synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call it semi-synthetic if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a touch point because the DEA says
if it's synthetic, it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my view, I'm not trying to make their
argument for them, but in my view as a
[SPEAKER_01]: biologist and chemist, pharmacologist,
if you have a starting product and an
[SPEAKER_01]: ending product that are different,
if you convert something into a different
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule, whether it's an isomer or not,
it is a synthetic process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, it's acid conditions that
form a big catalysis to this cyclizing
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, if you look at the chemical
structure of CBD compared to THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see how there's kind of a loop
that's not closed in CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the molecule is under reactive
conditions, some of those loose ends and
[SPEAKER_01]: the oxygens in the molecule want to form
partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the easiest, quickest thing for that
to happen is the loop closes on itself and
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD closes that ring and becomes a
tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that moment where the ring closes,
wherever that double bond is, it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: gets stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the same reaction that
creates delta-8-THC can create delta-10 or
[SPEAKER_01]: delta-7 or these other isomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another subtlety that gets a
little more for the chemistry sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligentsia, but there's racemic or
enantiomers that get formed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The position of hydrogens like on one
side, left hand or right hand side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ring, that flips around and changes too
when you've got CBD converting to THC in
[SPEAKER_01]: this reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my point here is that although there
are subtle differences, you get not only
[SPEAKER_01]: delta-8-THC, but kind of like four
different varieties, subtly different
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties of delta-8, delta-9 popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you create it under this laboratory
catalyzed chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that create in and of itself a big
safety concern?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not particularly that scared
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more scared of things like aggregates
that happen if the reaction is
[SPEAKER_01]: uncontrolled, where the CBD molecule
doesn't just close on itself, it closes on
[SPEAKER_01]: its neighbor, for example, get larger
molecular weight molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's not cleaned up, I would never
ever vape it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be something that sticks in your
lungs and is unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you mean by the labs not
finding what they're not looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are looking for the metals
and all these other things that are sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of commonly tested in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since it's going through this
synthetic process that's not being done,
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis, they may be missing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may well be missing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are labs doing this that,
again, I'm not trying to rag on the really
[SPEAKER_01]: good chemists that are trying to pioneer
this space, but there are others that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even have the sophistication to know
what I'm talking about at this moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that concerns me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these reactions, a good chemist
will know or will find out as soon as they
[SPEAKER_01]: start looking into this, that all of this
should be done under a stream of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: gas that's inert and helps the sort of
runaway oxidation reactions from
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't, you're going to get more
side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you cook it too hot, you're going to
get these different aggregates forming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that can be cleaned up with
filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to really clean it up and get Delta-8
as a pure molecule requires expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: product development, R&D, with techniques
of chromatography, that is to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: separation of the molecules that are in
there, that are not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of this industry is just chasing
huge profit margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will cut those corners,
and they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something where the good players
really ought to be inviting some level of
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even testing for metals and pesticides
and such, there aren't national standards
[SPEAKER_01]: for how those things are implemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this applies to the CBD industry at
large.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen many CBD products that seem to
have laboratory COAs that are bogus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's a problem in
Delta-8 big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis has long had an issue of lab
shopping, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We want our cannabis to have a higher THC
content, and this lab we know favors it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That product is super magnified in
Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the reason is the very
technical point I just raised,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you get different sort of small
flavors of THCs formed, these different
[SPEAKER_01]: subtle enantiomer differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people who are used to looking at
this chemistry, when you're doing a lab
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis, you basically get a readout that
looks like peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: On a chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those peaks on the chromatogram are
theoretically individual molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you separated them out cleanly enough,
every molecule would have its own little
[SPEAKER_01]: peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're trying to move quickly in
a lab, and you do that separation in a
[SPEAKER_01]: fast time, then you don't get much
separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the way that synthetic Delta-8
THC, and I will refer to what's out there
[SPEAKER_01]: as all synthetic, because to me,
that's what I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But lab converted synthetic Delta-8 THC,
because it has these subtle differences,
[SPEAKER_01]: the peak for Delta-8 or Delta-9 is going
to be wider and more less precise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's actually three or four
different varieties that are in there that
[SPEAKER_01]: move subtly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how do you know how much Delta-9 is
there to find out if you're still legal?
[SPEAKER_01]: You run it against a known lab standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lab standard is going to have a very
sharp, precise peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens in a lot of these Delta-8
products is, even when they're testing for
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta-9, right where that standard peak is
that's nice and sharp, it looks like,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, there's only 0.3% there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But labs can conveniently ignore that the
peak is broader, that there's more there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, some good lab labs,
and I refer now to Dr. Chris Hudala at
[SPEAKER_01]: Proverity Labs, he's insistent that he's
tested thousands of Delta-8 products that
[SPEAKER_01]: are out there in commerce, and that none
of them are under 0.3% Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the Delta-9 in these products are
also synthetically generated from the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're underestimating how much
Delta-9 is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in practicality, I've heard this
talked about because of my buddies that
[SPEAKER_01]: are making this or that are buying Delta-8
distillate and diluting it into tinctures
[SPEAKER_01]: or putting it into gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm not in a crusade against these
friends and others like them who are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make a good business out of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been told by a friend in this
business, oh, man, I had this product and
[SPEAKER_01]: one lad told me it was 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other said it was like 6%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another piece where,
like, I'm not scared of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cannabis should be regulated and
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people should be able to grow it
in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we need to have mature
open marketplaces about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there do need to be regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of this mystique and gray area
and market rush with Delta-8, among the
[SPEAKER_01]: many issues I've got some problem with is
just truth in advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've gone to shops where Delta-8
gets sold as, you know, it gives you the
[SPEAKER_01]: high of THC but not the anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't get you too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's THC light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, if you had pure Delta-8 THC,
a good bit of the evidence that's out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, especially from animal studies,
is that it's not as potent as Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe three quarters, maybe two thirds as
potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although some studies have found it as
potent, some from the early 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you hear user reports on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've also heard many user reports of
people that thought, oh, Delta-8 is
[SPEAKER_01]: lighter and safer and have ended up
consuming way too much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even experienced pot users that go into
that anxiety hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm concerned about the users who
aren't familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you know, I'm not a run,
save the children sort of fear monger,
[SPEAKER_01]: but teenagers shouldn't be able to buy
this at a gas station thinking like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's just gonna take the edge
off and not get them high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, most of them know it's gonna get
them high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I'm getting a little bit loose
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I was gonna ask, I mean,
why the focus specifically on Delta-8 THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: As you mentioned, there are other isomers
of Delta-10, Delta-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is Delta-8 more desirable than those
others?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Delta-8, it was just the low
hanging.
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit as far as how it's popped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta-8 emerges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we'll get to your question that
introduced us in a moment from what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: about to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even if you've got a cannabis
extract or a CBD, a hemp extract with high
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, and you're distilling it down to
make, say, a CBD oil, an enriched CBD oil
[SPEAKER_01]: for a tincture full spectrum product,
or to take it into isolate, putting that
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD rich extract in a distillation vessel
and cooking it down, if that's run too hot
[SPEAKER_01]: or too long, you get Delta-8 appearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That isomerization does happen even
without artificially lowering the pH as is
[SPEAKER_01]: being done now to make it more effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Delta-8, and again, Delta-8 has been
known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, there's not a vast
literature, but there are people doing
[SPEAKER_01]: some human studies with it in the early
70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were people doing some animal
studies with it, pharmacology studies in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 70s and 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was that one clinical trial I
mentioned in pediatric patients for the
[SPEAKER_01]: control of nausea associated with
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Delta-8 does have psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you do have these other isomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it's critical to be
talking about it right now, because,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could put up a picture of CBD
with all of the different products that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be formed with fairly simple reaction
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are called iso-THCs,
which definitely do not get formed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, but do get formed when this
chemical reaction is catalyzed in acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: cooking it up in acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta-10 may even be easier to form.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one that, you know, there are
Delta-10 products out there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are calling that like the next
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my question is why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I have a PhD in pharmacology focused
on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's safe to say very few people
on the planet had a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacology PhD before I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from 2001 when I finished my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never stopped studying this subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmacology is the question of how drugs
interact with the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what Delta-10 does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really hasn't been studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a sort of an anecdote out
there that Delta-10s emerged into this
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: This emergence came just a couple of years
ago or catalyzed because a cannabis farm
[SPEAKER_01]: in California was impacted by the
wildfires.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had a cannabis harvest,
a bunch of flour that was sprayed down
[SPEAKER_01]: with flame retardant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for whatever reason, and I'm not going
to drop the name of this because I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: sure how true the story is, they started
analyzing to see, well, can we extract the
[SPEAKER_01]: retardant out anyway?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the problem of the kind of
thinking that goes on in this unregulated
[SPEAKER_01]: market, not, oh crap, this is ruined.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got chemical flame retardants,
all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, people have investments in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their livelihood.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, well, there's a lot of
chemistry going on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we try to just extract that out and
get rid of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it doesn't show up in the final
product, then we're good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what was in the final product
included a lot of Delta-10.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't know why, but something about
that chemical flame retardant pushed that
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an opportunism straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not trying to be judgmental in a
bad way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, drug development follows
opportunistic routes too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one classic example that just pops to
my head is like Rogaine, minoxidil that's
[SPEAKER_01]: used for male pattern baldness and
stimulate hair growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a drug that was being tested for
like blood pressure control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a side effect, it grew hair and the
drug developers were like, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe let's put this into a topical and
see if it can grow hair on bald men.
[SPEAKER_01]: So opportunism isn't bad, but in that
controlled industry, there's a great deal
[SPEAKER_01]: of what's called pharmacovigilance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to follow up and you have to show
that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the world of pharmacovigilance,
an example that pops up is Vioxx,
[SPEAKER_01]: selective Cox inhibitors that were
developed because they don't cause gastric
[SPEAKER_01]: bleeds as much, but it turns out they
caused cardiac related fatalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those fatalities occurred at like
one in 10,000 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it was taken off the market for good
reason, but that wasn't detected until a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people were using it,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the cannabis and hemp space is
going to go into laboratory based
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesis, even if it's just a one
chemical step conversion, you do get
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction products that you're not looking
for and it needs to have oversight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you ask a great question, why focus on
Delta-8?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well now, because it's everywhere and it's
the molecule of the moment and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go away because it's got a lot of
use, but Delta-10 is coming out,
[SPEAKER_01]: other deltas, other cannabinoid variants
like THCV, which definitely has created in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, in some genetic lines of the
plant, some varieties of cannabis create
[SPEAKER_01]: these so-called propyl cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very interested in those, but you can
cook them up in the lab using CBD as a
[SPEAKER_01]: starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen conversations between chemists
who are working on their protocols to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabinoid THCP from CBD as a
starting material.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is THCP?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was only just discovered early last
year or reported by Italian researchers
[SPEAKER_01]: who described this new phyto cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason it was a big splash is
because it's supposedly 30 times more
[SPEAKER_01]: potent than Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are chemists right now trying to
iron out their protocol where if they can
[SPEAKER_01]: start with CBD isolate that was hemp
derived and make it THCP in an efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: way, then they're going to go through the
same loophole and say it's hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's obviously a race for profit
margins because it's not what the intent
[SPEAKER_01]: of the law is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need to have mature
conversations about this or there's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be possibly toxicity effects in the
population, public health concern,
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly a massive flow back on the
industry that just turns this into an
[SPEAKER_01]: enterprise controlled by big pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're not talking very transparent
about how to move forward in a industry
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated way, then there's going to be
potential for real problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how open really is this loophole?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is what folks are doing converting CBD to
Delta-8 THC, is that technically legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they kind of playing with fire here
and it's only a matter of time before they
[SPEAKER_00]: get cracked down on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will say that I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will also say that I have seen
well-heeled and respected lawyers come
[SPEAKER_01]: down on both sides of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my view as a pharmacologist who has
studied this quite closely, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta-8 THC is explicitly listed as a
schedule one substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point in time, it is also to me as
a scientist, it is unequivocally a analog
[SPEAKER_01]: of Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as close to Delta-9 THC as you can
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because Delta-9 THC is still schedule
one, the analog act of like 1985,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my view, clearly includes Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's kind of a double dose of
schedule one illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEA sees it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Association of Food and Drug Officials
who writes model code for the FDA seen it
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the FDA sees it as illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Delta-9 THC shouldn't be in
schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole schedule one status has never,
ever been based in science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we're moving towards wrapping up
this conversation, I mean, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to point out that all of this
STEM comes from the absurdity of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am someone who believes that human
beings have not only a natural right to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but seeking the psychoactivity
and therapeutic medicinal effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is as natural a behavior as you
can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cultural, social, religious evolution
of human beings has been wrapped up in a
[SPEAKER_01]: dance with the selected cultivated
evolution of the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge, fun, fascinating story,
the long cannabis human relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as natural as can be to seek out the
use of natural plant cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that it's prohibited has
never been based in science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been contrary to human medical
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's led to things like super high THC
content and reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's leading to seeking avenues for that
experience, whether it's therapeutic or
[SPEAKER_01]: just for the mental effects because you
want it, that are less natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have no problem saying that how
Delta-8 and these other isomers are being
[SPEAKER_01]: made is less natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we move forward where, you know,
hey, cannabis is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call this cannabis but we need to
have those discussions and all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stems around having an unhealthy,
over-regulated, prohibited status of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, yeah, I guess that's kind of a
mic drop moment because I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_01]: where, that's where I end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I did want to ask you too,
and you mentioned that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that Delta-8 THC is being produced
now is unnatural, but is there,
[SPEAKER_00]: a potential for the plant to be naturally
making Delta-8 THC and perhaps,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, breeders selecting for that or,
you know, can create a more natural
[SPEAKER_01]: product?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've talked, I talked to one friend
who's, again, I won't name drop,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he's been a very, very influential,
infamous cannabis breeder in the world and
[SPEAKER_01]: has studied the chemistry of extracts
quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told me he didn't think Delta-8 is
real at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thinks even the trace amounts that's
been found is an artifact of dissolving
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff in order to put it in chemistry
to analyze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bounced that off of another friend who
is very well known in cannabis medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: who says that, I mean, so this was Ethan
Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will drop his name because I don't think
he would shy away from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan thinks that Delta-8 can be made in
the plant, that he has seen analysis of
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties in Europe that seem to reliably
have higher levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he's, I pitch his name
because he is involved in a group called
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeders Best and they have interest in
breeding for Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea where, I don't know how
Delta-8 occurs in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you asked me, I will give a
shout out to the question that brought
[SPEAKER_01]: this conversation together because you
said, you know, Dr. G, like if your
[SPEAKER_01]: definition of synthesis is CBD is one
thing and it turns to Delta-8,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's another, so it's synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the decarboxylation reaction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the plant makes CBD-A,
THC-A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we heat it, it converts to the
neutral form, THC as we know it and CBD as
[SPEAKER_01]: we know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very astute question.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are different molecules,
but in my mind, the decarboxylation that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens, the activating that happens is,
it certainly absolutely occurs in nature
[SPEAKER_01]: when the plant stays out in the field and
it's got UV radiation and heat,
[SPEAKER_01]: that decarboxylation happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's made in an enzyme or not,
it's clearly made with, happens in the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome of the plant if it's,
you know, in the field long enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also see it as a thermodynamic
inevitably CBD will always break down to
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD given just enough time and warmth and
heat to bump the reaction over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to get it to hundreds of
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the point where it's at
equilibrium and it all shifts over,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, it all, it all will move
over just like a bowl of water sitting at
[SPEAKER_01]: on a 70 degree day will all evaporate even
though it never hits its boiling point.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD-A is all going to go to CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually that said, you know,
THC is eventually going to break down
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more thermodynamically favorable to
turn into Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta-8 is more stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect that's how it's coming in the
plant is some fraction of Delta-9 which
[SPEAKER_01]: degrades into CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it will shift into Delta-8 first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm skeptical that we can breed for
high Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would love to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think high Delta-8 flower would be
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, again, because I will fall back on
an argument for whole plants because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that the chemical phenotypic
diversity of the cannabis genus is just so
[SPEAKER_01]: utterly remarkable that if people want a
lighter high, then let's focus on breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: type two plants that have under 10% THC
and a nice balance of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much potential that I think the
industry should focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the route of, hey,
let's chase good margins by taking just
[SPEAKER_01]: bulk CBD and processing it in labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's giving some applied chemists work and
I'm not against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it tilts the agriculture
towards a monoculture that is not
[SPEAKER_01]: creative, that is not celebrating the
diversity of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also creates, you know, if you're going
to do it that way, then why not just work
[SPEAKER_01]: on making more and more greater efficiency
with, you know, transgenic yeast to spit
[SPEAKER_01]: out cannabinoids, which again is not a,
you know, I'm not criticizing that as some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of ignoble adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've met really smart,
cool people who are trying to make
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids out of yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that's what we're doing is making a
molecule, I think that the diversity,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're at a point in history where the
diversity of cannabis can be explored far
[SPEAKER_01]: greater than it ever has been before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to see that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be involved with ventures that
support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be room for all of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The derivative stream of hemp is going to
include everything from graphene batteries
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, hemp Crete to cannabinoid
molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to take chemical
processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be something that's done
transparently, that's regulated in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, clean, potentially risky
products, risky manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not forget that putting reaction
vessels at pressure with high acid is a
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous thing to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's no oversight, then somebody
that bought cheap CBD isolate can cook it
[SPEAKER_01]: up and risk themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also a plug I never put in there,
but just on this question of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the conversation that we assume is
that you're starting with a very pure CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your starting product is dirty in the
first place, then these unknown reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: products are going to multiply.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Delta-8, maybe there will be Delta-8
plants in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wait that and find a great interest in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make a great point about,
you know, if you're looking for a lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: high, why are there not more type two type
plants or products available?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can just speak personally from up
here in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to a recreational dispensary,
it's rare if you ever find anything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a straight type one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you ask people,
why is there not more variety here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they say that that's all
the growers want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there is just,
there could be a wider market for people
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a more balanced experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's probably just going to take time
for people to realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to take time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could be on the cusp of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen dispensaries where I've,
you know, found a really lovely,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like outdoor grown type two
variety that I thought, man, I could use
[SPEAKER_01]: this all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I'm not a heavy consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's great future in those
for the sort of wellness aspect and those
[SPEAKER_01]: who like the experience but don't want to
get, feel inebriated by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's huge future in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's what's driving the,
but I think there's a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of what's driving the Delta
eight market is a so-called legal high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's one step away from sort of
the illicit mentality of the spice sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference is potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that reason, I think that these
synthetic pathways, I see them as not
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a legal loophole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've advised multiple companies,
yet you might, I'm not an economist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not someone who chases a fast profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're going to get where the
getting is good, but I wouldn't invest a
[SPEAKER_01]: market, a business plan in Delta eight
because I think that the justification for
[SPEAKER_01]: it being currently illegal is just too
strong because of the synthesis of a Delta
[SPEAKER_01]: nine analog.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do want to be mindful of your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I kept you over the half hour a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do let you go, I wanted to give
you the opportunity to plug any websites
[SPEAKER_00]: or social media that you're involved in
that people can connect with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, I have several different things
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Instagram is at ganjanesh,
G-A-N-J-A-N-E-S-H.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've plugged that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of personal stuff,
but I comment on the industry I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can be found on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few different ventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have a license for a medical
cannabis dispensary up in Weirton,
[SPEAKER_01]: West Virginia called Weir Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's under development.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with a CBD hemp company called
Tennessee Pharmaceuticals with an F-T-N
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmaceuticals dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also very new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in transition and I'm really I'm
getting involved in an exciting venture
[SPEAKER_01]: that's relevant to all this that I can't
even really talk about too much yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it involves wanting to create a
better, transparent, open marketplace for
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and cannabis derivatives where there
is authentication of the chain of custody
[SPEAKER_01]: and the various validations and
certifications that go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now the world of buying and
selling these cannabis derivatives like
[SPEAKER_01]: distillates or biomass even, there are
huge trust issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are huge transparency issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm involved with a venture that is
going to try to help be a solution for
[SPEAKER_01]: those to have a greater open market
exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that doesn't really give people a plug
to look for a specific site, but maybe to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep their eyes open or if somebody's mind
pops when they hear that and thinks,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my God, that's exactly like my tech
company, then reach out and connect with
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put links into the show description
so people can easily find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg, thanks again for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could have talked for a few
more hours, but we'll cut it out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to see you out in Canbed this
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed my conversation with
Greg Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the links in the show
description to learn more about the topics
[SPEAKER_00]: we discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks again to our sponsor,
Project CBD.
