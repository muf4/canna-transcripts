[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you all for staying to the
bitter end.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so my name is Josh Werzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the president of SC Labs, and we're an
analytical testing laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're located in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a location in Northern California
in Santa Cruz, hence the name SC Labs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a location in Orange County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been in business for about five
and a half years, but I personally have
[SPEAKER_00]: been testing cannabis for seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started out as a research and
development chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worked in small molecules synthesis,
and then silicon polymer synthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of wanted to get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silicon polymer chemistry uses some pretty
gnarly chemicals, and just kind of was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to see what was out there one
night, and read a post on Craigslist for a
[SPEAKER_00]: job, and normal posting for a director in
an analytical laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the very end, it said, must be
comfortable working with medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I was not aware that
there were any type of laboratories that
[SPEAKER_00]: would test medical marijuana, or that
they're marijuana laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being a connoisseur of cannabis,
I filled out my resume, and I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go in and see what it was all
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: More just kind of snoop on what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sent it in about 2 in the morning,
because I had to stay up late and make my
[SPEAKER_00]: resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to call at 8 o'clock the next
morning, come in for an interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went in on my lunch break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offered me the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't like my job, so I figured,
yeah, I'll do this for maybe a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and leave it off my resume, and go get a
real job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seven years later, I'm still doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the really cool things about
what I do is that I've been able to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of sit on the sidelines and see everything
that's happened over the last seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there when we found the first CBD
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, that was confirmed CBD
for the medical community in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an OG Kush blueberry cross that
came out of Harborside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten to see all the developments,
and that's been really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is just kind of
briefly talk about what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to keep you here too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of issues I see in the testing
industry over the years and going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of share some of the data we've
collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the cool things also is that we
have a huge sample size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to see pretty much everything that
comes through the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of really fun to play with
the data and see trends over time and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll apologize if I hurry you through
this, but I've got a lot to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would we test cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, a lot of states,
California excluded right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in about a year, we'll have mandatory
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But required testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to always need to be done
at a third party lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sort of serve that function
voluntarily for our clients now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one is required to do any type of
quality control analysis, or there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: type of oversight as it sits in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still have a fair amount of the
industry that at least does some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily what they'll do under
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of these, you'll see,
are not necessarily tests that will ever
[SPEAKER_00]: be required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of going to what Mark said and
Dr. Jacobson said, I have a presentation I
[SPEAKER_00]: do in front of infused products
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talk about stratified sampling and
getting an idea on your batch runs and
[SPEAKER_00]: your RSDs and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone just kind of glosses over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of a real problem we see
with our clients is someone might bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: an edible product that they do a run every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once a month, they'll bring in one of
their products and test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two months later, they come back and
say, well, why is this 20% higher than the
[SPEAKER_00]: one I made two months ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think what we would like to see
is producers get a much better handle on
[SPEAKER_00]: their production processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as people are getting more
sophisticated, we do see people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: a good handle on their production
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know their deviation from batch to batch
and throughout a batch, throughout a
[SPEAKER_00]: production run and product improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also agree with Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably shouldn't be saying it's kind
of counterproductive to my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see the big infused product
manufacturers and probably a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: big producers having in-house labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's absolutely essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the service that we provide is
more of going to be a third party kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: verification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll do quality control for the small
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bigger producers really should be
doing a lot of this in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of tests are applicable?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not even a comprehensive list.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabinoids by far, what we do the
most of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started testing, that's pretty
much all we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did microbiological.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only one or two clients that
bothered with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potentially for safety and maybe not
necessarily as much for quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for safety, probably the least
important test until you get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: infused products.
[SPEAKER_00]: For infused products, obviously it's very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for herbal cannabis that you're going
to smoke, the difference between 15% THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and 20% THC is going to be nominal for the
end user as far as safety goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbiological contamination,
pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing you do in food testing
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference is with cannabis being
inhaled into the lungs in a lot of forms,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the pathogens are slightly more or
I guess less important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microtoxins, pesticide residues,
residual solvents in solvent-based
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts, and the products made from the
solvent-based extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy metals, moisture, terpenes,
plant fertility testing is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting more and more requests for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then genetic sex determination,
genetic sequencing, all the stuff that MGC
[SPEAKER_00]: does such a good job of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one, cannabis measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis produces dozens of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is news to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we first started doing testing,
it was really kind of boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I worked at Stipa, we only had three
reference standards available,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, CBD, and CBM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tested on a GC, and I sat there and
looked at the exact same chromatogram all
[SPEAKER_00]: day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the worst job in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so more and more we're starting
to see a little more diversity with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, THCA is by far the dominant
cannabinoid in pretty much everything we
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much the only cannabinoid
that's there in significant quantities in
[SPEAKER_00]: most of what we test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's three different instruments
that people commonly use for cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they each have their pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of always use the analogy of,
well, there's a socket wrench,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a crescent wrench, and there's a
tire iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them can remove a bolt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending on what bolt you're trying
to remove, there's a best tool for that
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everyone's kind of using
liquid HPLC, liquid chromatography,
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabinoid testing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to test the acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you the sensitivity that you need
that you can't get with spectroscopic
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lower limits of detection limits
the quantification in better linearity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't the most interesting sample of
cannabis you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a check standard, because again,
I want to show you some peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a run on HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've not seen Mark's presentation,
even though I do know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is pretty much the exact same
curve he showed you, if you noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the same numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes from the animal cup
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we test for this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually one of the first jobs we
did when we opened our lab was test for
[SPEAKER_00]: the animal cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been testing for them ever
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been able to see the trends over
time with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we started adding terpene
testing, it's really cool to kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: watch the trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these things are seasonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They varied over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that data, if I had more time,
I would love to share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so this is the distribution of
cannabinoid content for the animal cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to get back to kind of why
I'm comparing the animal cup and why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also from the animal cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is total cannabinoids for
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this right here is a comparison of the
animal cup, the same distribution you saw
[SPEAKER_00]: before, compared to all of our samples
from October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the October samples are about 8,000
or 9,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kind of wanted to compare the
animal cup to our general population of
[SPEAKER_00]: samples and see if there's much variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there isn't that much variation with
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, the kind of historic October
mean is a little bit skewed, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: get a lot of kind of R&D stuff,
trim, stuff like that, that ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: falling under flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get a little bit wider standard
deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a little bit lower mean,
but essentially really similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not too surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the animal cup, this is kind of
the best of the best NorCal breeders that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been doing this for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be an all organic cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get into that in just a sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's people who do a lot of breeding
on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really good genetically diverse
pool to kind of look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some distributions from
individual cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one on the left is CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, most of the samples had very
little CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you kind of cut out any sample that has
less than 1% CBD, then you get the light
[SPEAKER_00]: blue line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you move it over to about,
what do we got down here, 11.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the animal cup is a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another reason why I'm showing you the
animal cup results is they have very good
[SPEAKER_00]: judging process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go to a lot of these cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the judging processes are,
I guess, less than stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They truly anonymize their samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pull really, really good people,
experts in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: to do the judging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to illustrate a point
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the top 20 samples out
of 487 flow samples, I want to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is really no difference in the top
20 samples versus the overall mean as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a higher cannabinoid content isn't
going to get you in the top 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows no correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there is one sample in the top
20 that tested like 32 or 30.4 or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that and kind of skewed it
to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe the winners would actually have a
lower mean than the general population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the kind of
things that the testing industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the disservice the testing industry has
done to, I guess, the cannabis industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: that when people started testing cannabis,
and it started becoming common,
[SPEAKER_00]: it became this score game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who has the highest testing strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of really good strains just kind
of disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of your perps, Bubba Kush,
LA Confidential, I'm forgetting a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these really good strains
that had very interesting terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles, had a lot of value, went away
because they didn't test in the 20s or in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think with kind of our
understanding of what really is important,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's the terpenes, is we'll start to
see some of these strains come back,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is where you get your winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you map the winner's total terpene
content versus the standard mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a full standard deviation
difference between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the only real predictor of
where a sample is going to rank from the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers is terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not cannabinoid content at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for terpene testing, we use GCFID.
[SPEAKER_00]: GC is ideal for testing terpenes,
similar to Mark's method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get good sensitivity, a longer linear
range, and really good separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 34 compounds in our terpene test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then getting back to their more cup
winners, I normalized all the samples
[SPEAKER_00]: based on their overall results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all terpene content, so we're
comparing apples to apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is kind of a map of how many
standard deviations they were away from
[SPEAKER_00]: the means.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the top 20 samples, again,
and in which terpenes in those top 20
[SPEAKER_00]: samples were prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see, it seemed like the judges in
this instance really liked their nursing
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant strains, alpha terpenine,
isopugilol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of minor cannabinoids,
so it's hard to say how much they
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they definitely were there in large
amounts in the winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these terpenes actually track
with other terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have terpenes that kind of pair up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if one's high, the other's high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if one's low, the other's low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I have more time, I'll get into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and then terpenylene,
alpha pining, beta pining, we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively abundant in the desirable
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And osmine, that's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's the mercine and emerald
club flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you graph it like that, you get
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you normalize it with the
overall results, the overall terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: content, most of your terpenes start to
look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least the major ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of samples that have very
little, a third to a half of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kind of have this even
distribution in certain terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mercine goes all the way out to 75% of the
overall terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have lemmonine that doesn't
necessarily get as high, but very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: histogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the only one that's kind of
interesting is terpenylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these terpenylene dominant strains,
I cut the top off this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 377 strains out of the 470 had
essentially no terpenylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had this handful of strains
that had a whole bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's your terpenylene dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one of the terpenes that kind of
behaves like none of the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the terpene content of
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I had shown you the slides where we
saw the winners here, you would see that
[SPEAKER_00]: all the winners were in the last three
bars with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the concentrates, high terpene
content was even a greater predictor of
[SPEAKER_00]: where the sample would actually end up
scoring in the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what happened to my
distribution curve there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a little wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next test that is kind of important
and is a part of basically any state
[SPEAKER_00]: that's requiring testing regulations is
microbiological testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all three petri dishes with
different species of aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't put aspergillus on this list
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the kind of common tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: California is going to require an APC,
total yeast and mold, E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, coliforms, salmonella, shigella.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then listeria and pseudomonas in some
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudomonas is required in the city of
Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of too many states that are
going to require it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty debatable whether anyone
should be requiring pseudomonas testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listeria, for some food-based infused
products, I think makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: General cannabis, probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, just to give you kind of
an idea what happens with samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the emerald cup is supposed to be
all outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be an outdoor kind of more
of a homogenous sample than our general
[SPEAKER_00]: sample size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the general samples
that come through the door, the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: are almost identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even make another slide to show
you those, because they're almost
[SPEAKER_00]: identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are based on the AHPA
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So APC, 2.7% were over the AHPA limit for
APC, aerobic plate count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeast and mold is always trouble at
100,000 CFUs per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one we have the most failures,
I guess, with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pseudomonas, none of them failed under
the Mold House Berkeley regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salmonella, we didn't detect any
salmonella in the emerald cup samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coliforms, 1.7% were over the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, 4% had E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, other than yeast and
mold, even an outdoor crop produced by all
[SPEAKER_00]: different people can come in pretty safely
under the limits that are kind of being
[SPEAKER_00]: established out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the AHPA guidelines are kind of being
adopted everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticide residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pesticides are a really big issue for
us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a really big issue starting
with the emerald cup testing, because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is the first year we did pesticide testing
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's supposed to be an all organic
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, no one used pesticides in
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that's the way it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was definitely a big
controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really, I think, kind of sparked a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of a little scary,
but fun to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, our pesticide assay,
again, we're not in a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's being forced to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our pesticide assay is actually very
basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our limits of detection are relatively
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably 10 to 100 times higher
than the action levels in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very generous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that, A, to keep costs down,
and again, to kind of incentivize people
[SPEAKER_00]: to do the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it saves us kind of expensive sample
cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, we still see plenty of
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me go just straight to this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running out of time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are our failure rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the month before the emerald cup
and the three months following the emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: cup, just kind of showing our overall
failure rates for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the emerald cup, it was much better
than the mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the people were pretty honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there was a few people that,
and I guess that's the fun thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a conformational mass spectrometry,
LC-MS-MS, with triple quad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very hard to get a false positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if something is below our limit
of detection, it's going to sneak through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very hard to get a false
positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice thing with the pesticide
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple times, the laboratory issue
got brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big issues with laboratories is
there has been very little oversight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And California did a really good thing
with their new regulations by requiring
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone to get ISO 17025 certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the bare minimum an
analytical laboratory should meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, that will help things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis laboratories are no different
than environmental laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or any other, I guess, analytical or
diagnostic laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be incentive to
not fail people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always going to be incentive
to cut corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tight margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our margins aren't necessarily the same as
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now in California, someone can
throw a GC in the back of a van,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even a near infrared in the back of a
van, and drive around and call themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: a testing laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's who we're competing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But across the board, there's the
pesticide test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice, because we don't get a lot of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because 99 out of 100 times, someone comes
up to you and, well, why did I fail this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I failed for Michael Butanon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, did you use Eagle 20?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't use Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think also, too, with kind of the
grower community, as they get more
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated, you'll see a lot less
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So October, we had 49% of our samples we
saw failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, pesticide testing and the
pesticides we detect in samples vary
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so October is kind of the outdoor crop
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some rain early in the season,
right before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: People probably had to resort to the
Michael Butanon, which is a fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we failed 49% of the pesticide
samples that came in the door then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, we don't do every test we
get through the door isn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: tested for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are people that kind of,
I guess, theoretically would have
[SPEAKER_00]: self-selected for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still, half of them failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it got a little bit better after
the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the Emerald Cup, we definitely lost
some clients, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people knew not to bring their stuff
in if they had used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually kind of steadily declined
since then, which is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, yeah, the Emerald Cup,
we still, 13% of the samples had one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or three, I think a couple had three.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so back up here, that's just a
graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the pesticides that we test
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only have, I think, 12 up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we selected those because those are
the ones people are actually using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with cannabis, your big pest and your
big pest concern is going to be mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's aphids, and there's thrips,
and there's a few other things that will
[SPEAKER_00]: attack cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what destroys crops and people's
biggest concern when it comes to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: are mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a handful of pesticides that
people are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill the mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one or two fungicides people
use, and there's a couple of plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Paclobutazole and Diamondazide are
actually plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are compounds that were packaged
in a lot of hydroponics products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of sneakily, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 99% natural and not necessarily
labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're making buds really hard,
and they keep the plants nice and short,
[SPEAKER_00]: and improve your yields 20%, 30%,
40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why wouldn't I use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen a lot less of that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been harder to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the products have had
Diamondazide and Paclobutazole pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're not meant for any type of
crop that's used for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have kind of gotten hip,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by and large, your cannabis producers
aren't trying to do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have the best intentions and
just didn't know any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see less and less Paclobutazole and
Diamondazide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's our pesticide assay,
and we're still failing 50% of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's not necessarily the case
across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of labs that test for 60,
100.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a whole panel for organochlorine
that's in the Liza kit, and everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 12, and we fail 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have really bad limits of
detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, those will decrease by about
1,000 times when regulations come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those numbers will go up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just want to briefly touch on
residual solvents because I think I'm out
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, so residual solvents with
solvent extracts coming on the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of the extraction histogram I
showed you for the Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of samples that came in,
40%, 50%, 60% cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because it's an organic cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the concentrates were supposed to be
solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see less and less of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you show the general population
histogram for what we see for
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, 95% to 96% of the
concentrates we see now are all either
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent extracts or CO2 extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's very little water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very little keif out there these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of what the market is
determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas five, six years ago, it was
probably flip-flopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would see maybe 80% or 90% keif in
water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once in a while, you get a really cool
solvent extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'd be unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with kind of dabbing coming on and all
that stuff, we see very little of the old
[SPEAKER_00]: type extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So residual solvent analysis, pretty
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of dissolving you're sampling a
liquid and having all your gases that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to measure bubble up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in a much bigger vial in a
solid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into an oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets shaken a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gases get liberated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a partition coefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sample from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you measure the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your solvent extracts that you use
solvent are made with butane or propane or
[SPEAKER_00]: a combination of butane and propane.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some people still that they're
making extracts with kind of the heavier
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbons or maybe alcohol,
but it's definitely very few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microtoxins, that's another test that's
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of brought up in Kevin's
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a very tough one also.
[SPEAKER_00]: With pesticides, it's hard enough to get
through the matrix effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're looking at a couple orders
of magnitude, more sensitive for
[SPEAKER_00]: microtoxins is definitely a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it requires pretty expensive mass
specs that can go really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of sample cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that talks about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, my time is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry I kind of hurried through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's the testing industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely been an evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the testing industry has gotten
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen kind of the industry as a
whole get more sophisticated and growing
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been an interesting trip the
last seven years kind of just seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of the whole cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thanks to Medicinal Genomics for
putting this on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of one of the cool things
of seeing the evolution of the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: five, six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: A conference at Harvard Medical School
with kind of the level of presenters that
[SPEAKER_00]: we had today wouldn't even have been on my
radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait to be back in seven years
and see where it goes then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
