[SPEAKER_00]: So what were some of the most surprising
things that you found in that analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the first thing that caught
our attention was that we initially
[SPEAKER_01]: expected that the white genes to show more
specific expression in samples from male
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, but only a small proportion of
the genes on the white chromosome are
[SPEAKER_01]: expressed exclusively in the male flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: While many other genes were expressed in
samples from other genes, including those
[SPEAKER_01]: from female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So searching about that, I see that this
pattern can be explained by some
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers indicating that only a small
proportion of the white chromosome is
[SPEAKER_01]: unique, with the majority being shared
with the X chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still a thing that needs more
deep attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another notable finding was the clustering
of the trichomes samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we know, trichomes are where
the synthesis and storage of the medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds are in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we observed that the trichomes samples
showed very similar expression profiles,
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of chemotype, indicating that
it's likely that only a small number of
[SPEAKER_01]: genes that differentiate these chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's something that needs more
deeper interpretations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying parts of the Y chromosome
can actually be found in female plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genes provenance from the Y region also
have expression in other cheeses,
[SPEAKER_01]: including in female cheeses, in the case
of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
Let's
take a look.
