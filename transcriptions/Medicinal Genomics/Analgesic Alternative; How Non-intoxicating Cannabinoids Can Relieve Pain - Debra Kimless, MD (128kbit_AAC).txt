[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for the McKernan family and
the organizers for providing this amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to present today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you all for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Deb Kimlis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the medical director of Forward Grow,
a cultivation and processing company in
[SPEAKER_02]: Maryland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm also a medical advisor for Pure
Green, the manufacturer of the tablets I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: about to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I usually talk about nutrition,
microbiome, and ruining everybody's lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But today I'm going to talk about pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm an anesthesiologist by board
certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that there are over 110
million people in our country suffering
[SPEAKER_02]: with chronic pain is troublesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a third of our population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are also suffering with
comorbidities associated with chronic
[SPEAKER_02]: pain, including insomnia, anxiety,
and depression, which of course leads to
[SPEAKER_02]: more pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interesting thing about this is
that even though 110 million people are a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people, big pharma has really not
come up with a novel pain medicine since
[SPEAKER_02]: the development of naproxen sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was in the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there's modifications of this
molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there really has been no new
pharmacologic medication that's safely and
[SPEAKER_02]: reliably addressing painful conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in this month's Consumer Reports,
hardly a medical journal, they tried to
[SPEAKER_02]: summarize specific pain relieving target
options, which they broke down into four
[SPEAKER_02]: categories, acetaminophen, NSAIDs,
opioids, and muscle relaxers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interesting, you know, Consumers is
not a medical journal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They neglected to mention that there are
some FDA-approved medicines for painful
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for fibromyalgia, pregabalin,
deloxetine, and milnasipran, and for
[SPEAKER_02]: neuropathic pain, pregabalin and
deloxetine.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the rates and successes of this
pain relieving medications are variable at
[SPEAKER_02]: best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that pretty much everything else we
prescribe for pain relief are off-label
[SPEAKER_02]: uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: The anti-epileptics and the
antidepressants that we write for are
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with no double-blind randomized
trials supporting their use, nor are they
[SPEAKER_02]: FDA-approved for the indication of pain,
but we still prescribe them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, one out of every five
prescriptions that we prescribe as
[SPEAKER_02]: physicians are for off-label use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And commensurate with the FDA-approved
medications as well as the off-label,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a whole host of side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some reason, they're never good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should never underestimate the fact
that patients who take over-the-counter
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines actually believe that they're
safe and have either minimal or zero risk,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is why, of course, they believe it's
over-the-counter and not prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I read a recent study that said
that there's 50% to 80% of patients do not
[SPEAKER_02]: take their medications as prescribed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is for prescriptions,
not over-the-counter stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can almost guarantee that nobody
reads a label as evidenced by who here
[SPEAKER_02]: only takes one ibuprofen for a headache
ever, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there are risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we all are aware of the risk of
liver failure commensurate with an
[SPEAKER_02]: overdose of Tylenol and NSAIDs causing
cardiac dysrhythmias, including ibuprofen
[SPEAKER_02]: because most people take it, in
prescription doses, as well as the risk of
[SPEAKER_02]: NSAIDs, even as taken as directed on the
label, which, of course, no one does,
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with an increase in myocardial
infarction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the NIH has come out with the
overdose death rates from all prescription
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines, and they continue to increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you take out opiates,
again, they continue to increase over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these increases in opioid-related
deaths is in spite of our country's
[SPEAKER_02]: leadership declaring that opioid crisis as
a public health emergency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think that declaration's really
doing much because, as the CDC has
[SPEAKER_02]: written, that every day more than 1,000
people go to the emergency room for not
[SPEAKER_02]: using prescription opioids as directed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we do some math, which I'm not a
fan of, but if we do anyway, the average
[SPEAKER_02]: EOR visit costs about $1,900 across the
country, which means that we're spending
[SPEAKER_02]: $2 million a day for this indication only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet 115 people die each day from
opioid overdose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly, I call this under the
category of unintended consequence,
[SPEAKER_02]: beyond all of the other reasons why
there's a rise in opiate addiction and
[SPEAKER_02]: overdose, I found this in just a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a study by the University of
Alabama's Surgery that basically said that
[SPEAKER_02]: when they rescheduled hydrocodone to a
schedule two, physicians were writing for
[SPEAKER_02]: more, not less, pain pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with the exception of bariatric
surgery, for every other surgery,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a statistically significant
increase in pill writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason was because they couldn't
call in hydrocodone, and they didn't want
[SPEAKER_02]: patients to have to go to an EOR or have
to go back to the office to get pain
[SPEAKER_02]: relief, or also to make them so that they
don't look bad, because they don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: look like they didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back again to Consumer Reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that magazine, they said that they are
addressing the possibility of cannabis as
[SPEAKER_02]: a novel medication for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a medical community, we should be
ashamed that Consumer Reports actually
[SPEAKER_02]: addresses this first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was troubled, as we all are about
the opioid crisis, as well as needing
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions for patients who may or may not
have access to every iteration of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine due to their geography.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I figured, what is it that we can
do that is needed?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need something that's effective,
reliable, and safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that's easy to use to improve
compliance, so people take it as directed.
[SPEAKER_02]: A reliable composition, so everybody feels
comfortable taking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that can be titratable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-intoxicating, because most patients
don't want to be sidelined by their pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they also don't want to be sidelined
by their pain medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ideally, something that's affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was given the opportunity to
create a novel pain reliever, so I
[SPEAKER_02]: formulated this.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD at five milligrams, palmitoyl
ethanolamide, which from now on will be
[SPEAKER_02]: called PEA, because that's too difficult
to pronounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then terpenes, four iterations,
which I'll go into in a sec, total of .1
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram in a rapidly dissolvable
sublingual tablet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so why PEA?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I believe in the entourage effect,
and as an anesthesiologist, we use
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine synergistically.
[SPEAKER_02]: We administer a little bit of many drugs
to try to enhance positive effects and
[SPEAKER_02]: minimize adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at a CanMed conference in Boston a
couple years ago, Dr. Mishulam showed a
[SPEAKER_02]: slide of molecules that he called
endocannabinoid-like.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said they were naturally occurring,
that they were bioactive, and he wondered
[SPEAKER_02]: why no one was studying them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I quickly wrote them down in a
notebook, because I'm a bit of a geek,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I began my research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I found was, with PEA,
an endocannabinoid-like molecule really
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was new to me, but it wasn't new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was discovered in the 1950s and
actually has been used for pain relief by
[SPEAKER_02]: itself, albeit at higher concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you that don't know,
PEA is a fatty acid amide, like its
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid relatives, has a complex
multimodal mechanism of action.
[SPEAKER_02]: It activates intracellular, nuclear,
and membrane-associated receptors and
[SPEAKER_02]: regulates many physiologic functions
related to the inflammatory cascade and
[SPEAKER_02]: chronic pain states.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, it directly targets
PPR-alpha, GPR55, GPR119.
[SPEAKER_02]: It indirectly affects CB1 and 2 receptors
through enhancing anandamide through the
[SPEAKER_02]: entourage effect by competing with FA.
[SPEAKER_02]: PEA down-modulates mast cell activation,
inhibits release of inflammatory mast cell
[SPEAKER_02]: mediators, histamine, and TNF-alpha.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mast cells are often found near
sensory endings, sensory nerve endings,
[SPEAKER_02]: and their degranulation can enhance the
nociceptive signal, and the reason why
[SPEAKER_02]: peripheral mast cells are considered to be
pro-inflammatory and pro-nociceptive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this just skims the surface of PEA's
magical and complicated mechanism of
action.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how it can play a role in mitigating
pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I found this incredibly
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we combined PEA, CBD, and four
terpenes, beta-karyophylline, humuline,
[SPEAKER_02]: mercy, and linalool in a rapidly
dissolvable sublingual tablet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal was to treat mild to moderate
pain to compete with Tylenol and
[SPEAKER_02]: ibuprofen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't believe this was gonna
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I trialed it first on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on 16 patients, nine females,
seven males.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and age 53.2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patients had a variety of painful
conditions, back and neck pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: arthritis, musculoskeletal, neuropathic,
dysmenorrhea, and one person had a
[SPEAKER_02]: hangover during the trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we used the Wong-Baker pain scale
for easy rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the average pre-treatment pain
scale score was 5.13.
[SPEAKER_02]: After one tablet, the average pain score
dropped to two.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more than half in 20 minutes or
less.
[SPEAKER_02]: The score dropped again to almost by half
to 1.25 in another 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then again to .44 after an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then two hours dropped to .25.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a graph of the individual pain
scale scores for every patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was the average score over two
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this formulation approximates the
onset of traditional mild to moderate pain
[SPEAKER_02]: relievers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ours is a little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't officially check beyond two
hours because again, I really didn't think
[SPEAKER_02]: this was gonna work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did ask patients to take down notes
as to when their pain returned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most documented somewhere between four and
six hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two people claimed that with a single
tablet, it lasted two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so of course we worry about side
effects, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanna make sure everything is safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: A survey of the literature looked at the
side effects of PEA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are no reports of severe adverse
reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, the rate of adverse events
are even less than placebo in a double
[SPEAKER_02]: blind study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're all understanding the
favorable safety profile of CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're actually looking at this with
an expanded study, multi-site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anybody's out there in a legal
state that wants to participate,
[SPEAKER_02]: please see me afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the preliminary results seem to mirror
the prior study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the medical statement has always
been first, do no harm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the question is how?
[SPEAKER_02]: So perhaps Dr. Mishulam, consumer reports,
and all of us here today have illuminated
[SPEAKER_02]: a path.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thank you, and wow, I really beat
the clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Jersey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I speak quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anyone has any questions,
that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use the pain, the number of pain
patients in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you know if any of, a lot of the states
that allow for medical marijuana classify
[SPEAKER_00]: pain as a kind of catch-all condition?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering if that affects that
statistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think they do classify it as a
single like pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they break it down to
neuropathic or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I did see studies that the
majority of the pain conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: the top two are back pain, and the second
one is neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to ask if you could suss out
the neuropathic pain responses from
[SPEAKER_02]: others, other types of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a couple patients with neuropathic
pain, and their pain was reduced
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly, didn't go away completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But theirs was the less steep of the
curves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are gonna do that study.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you mentioned four terpenes very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you please repeat those?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my second question is,
is this tablet a CBD isolate?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it derived from industrial hemp,
or is it derived from therapeutic?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the four cannabinoids are
beta-karyophylline, humuline, linalool,
[SPEAKER_02]: and mercine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBD is isolated from a cannabis plant,
so not hemp.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering what, if any, are previously
known uses of PEA that may have inspired
[SPEAKER_05]: this at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: So pain, predominantly, and works in
metabolic issues as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the studies that I researched,
it's quite comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they use PEA a lot for pain mitigation
and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a follow-up, are you guys working
on any alternate formulations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your talk, Deb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this available to patients now?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the company's out of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can talk about that another time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBD iteration, they ship across state
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is the PEA, is that something you can
eat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it in the food?
[SPEAKER_02]: So PEAs, we make it, and plants make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people use it as a nutritional
supplement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can eat it and, yeah, take it as
pain medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the study you were talking about,
the multi-site study, that you're doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have missed something.
[SPEAKER_07]: But is it, do you have a control?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it randomized?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it just like a single-arm study
where you're just?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, it's a single-arm study for
real proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 16 patients is interesting,
but doesn't really speak to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first step is to do a proof of concept,
expand that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then ultimately, we'll develop a
placebo, which should be pretty easy,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then do a double-blind randomized
trial.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is the advantage of deriving your
CBD from marijuana rather than hemp with
[SPEAKER_04]: lower THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the advantage is that the company in
Michigan has access to a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis-derived CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so therefore, that a lot of people who
clapped here probably believe that there
[SPEAKER_02]: are molecules that go along with it,
that when you do extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so from the cannabis plant is a little
bit different from the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a complete isolate, CBD is a
molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you done the pain test with just PEA
tablets without the CBD to see the
[SPEAKER_03]: results?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are lots of studies out there
that have shown it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's at 300 milligram to 1,200
milligram a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is why I didn't think it was
going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because ours is just 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I'm thinking about the
entourage effect with the CBD in
[SPEAKER_02]: combination with the PEA and the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of the entourage effect,
how many different strains of cannabis are
[SPEAKER_06]: you currently testing these with?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, say that again?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you using one strain of cannabis to
test this with your medication,
[SPEAKER_06]: or multiple types?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if so, how many?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so I know that they had one
purveyor of cannabis, and it was one
[SPEAKER_02]: strain that the extraction was made from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question and good thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like where you're going with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's major differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for your attention.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
