[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk Podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the Senior Marketing Manager at
Medicinal Genomics and proud member of the
[SPEAKER_01]: team that puts on the CanMed Innovation
and Investment Summit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, registration for CanMed 25 is now
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out canmedevents.com to see details
about next year's event and the new
[SPEAKER_01]: location at the Wyndham Resort in Rio
Grande, Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you check out the ticket packages page,
you'll be happy to see that the price for
[SPEAKER_01]: the full summit package is lower than
CanMed 24, but that package still includes
[SPEAKER_01]: three nights at the resort, full access to
three days of CanMed presentations,
[SPEAKER_01]: workshops, and networking events,
meals, and cocktails, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The event's in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you do, but it's never too early to
purchase your ticket package for CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only will you take advantage of early
bird pricing, which gets you another $500
[SPEAKER_01]: off the full summit package, but you'll
also get the satisfaction that comes with
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing something off of your to-do list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest today is Justin S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Esquivel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin is CEO and geneticist at Green
Lustre Phenos, and he's been an influencer
[SPEAKER_01]: and leader in the cannabis industry for 15
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin was the head grower and geneticist
of an indoor commercial scale cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: operation back in 2012, and since then,
he's helped more than 100 cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: His one-of-a-kind approach to plasticity
breeding has yielded pest and
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria-resistant genetics, and his
application of cannabis tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_01]: selective homogenous breeding enable his
company to bring exotic, tailored
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring to growers globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: During our conversation, we discuss
Justin's background in traditional ag and
[SPEAKER_01]: how that applies to cannabis, how he uses
tissue culture to store genetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminate pathogens, the process for
creating stable cannabis varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: how purposely introducing pests and
pathogens into the breeding room helps
[SPEAKER_01]: select for resistance traits, and the
application of analytical tools such as
[SPEAKER_01]: PCR, HPLC, and marker-assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Justin, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Rare Earth Genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rare Earth Genomics is a dynamic
partnership formed with Texas A&M
[SPEAKER_01]: AgriLife, one of the world's leading

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Justin
[SPEAKER_01]: Esquivel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Justin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to talk with you about
cannabis breeding techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: The audience just heard me read your bio,
but maybe to start out, I'm going to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: you to elaborate a bit more on your
background, how you got into cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, and how your approach is
different from other breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, my background starts off in
traditional ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been breeding blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been breeding strawberries,
grafting Japanese maples, propagating Neco
[SPEAKER_00]: blue hydrangeas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have an extensive background with
breeding in general for all ag in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with cannabis, I would say around 2012
is where I really started getting my feet
[SPEAKER_00]: in the dirt and breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, stabilizing genetics,
plant genetics, very similar, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what has missed, kind of missed the
curve is you just got a lot of genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that are cross pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes poor breeding techniques are
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you end up with lots of different
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in seed form, they're very unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you've got strains that show
very high hermaphrodite tendencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got some that,
you know, you might have regular seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have 70% of them are male and
only 30% are female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you run into many scenarios,
growers do, buying seeds, buying clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really, really got me into
wanting to stabilize cannabis genetics so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have a very, very homozygous stock
of seed for growers to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, Madrid, we started in
Madrid in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were pretty predominant in a lot of the
coffee shops in the Netherlands area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to work with CBD germplasm,
just to name one offhand, Lion's
[SPEAKER_00]: Tabernacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won the 2012 CBD Cannabis Cup in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started getting involved with
breeding, but not just breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like I said, creating homozygosity as
well as plasticity breeding, which we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get into later as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so what's your approach to creating a
homozygous strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are also a tissue culture
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something unique that we do,
everything's in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything grows in cryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never looked at for up to a year at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this, we've been able to
really, really maintain a large vault of
[SPEAKER_00]: different genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 2000 strains that we've
hunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: From about 20 countries now, the USA being
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we get these into their vessels
where they go through either a
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplication phase or a rooting phase,
but more importantly, 100% sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to sterilize these genetics,
implementing apricot meristem tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get them back to their generation
zero, which is going to return that actual
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, that plant, that genotype to its
original vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take a sterile approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we go to create a new line,
we can pull from that vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get that out of tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start what's called the acclimation
phase, getting it used to being out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that 100% relative humidity vessel,
and then getting it into our inbreeding
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then will take that specific strain and
we will inbreed it and we get it to about
[SPEAKER_00]: an S4.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get to an S4, we then get it back
in the vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hold it in that S4 stage so that
when we come across another line that
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really checks all the boxes for
us, we then do the cross there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're creating stabilized offspring
in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, that's kind of our
approach, but we also take that plasticity
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something very, very unique that we're
doing and I've done in also traditional ag
[SPEAKER_00]: is we are taking I'll give you an
instance, an example of how we do this
[SPEAKER_00]: plasticity breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 35 gallon tubs, we are propagating and
growing fungus gnat larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We harvest this fungus gnat larvae with
wire mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we practice what we call targeted
releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might go into one breeding chamber
and we'll disperse this larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from start to finish, we're able to
find that specific genotype that shows the
[SPEAKER_00]: most resistance towards that specific
plant pressure, in this case being a
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they start in that larvae stage,
but then they evolve into that adult
[SPEAKER_00]: mobile stage where they're landing on your
plants, they're eating the foliage,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're causing damage to your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're able to take that genotype,
isolate it, and then bring that over to
[SPEAKER_00]: the next generation and breed again and
again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're constantly hunting for that
genotype that has the most resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: towards that plant pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are purposely introducing a pest in
this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: To try to identify the plants that have
the trait that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're a completely sealed facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: UVC filter, HEPA filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really have too many pest
pressures that come into our facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're able to control what does come
in and then create such such a high
[SPEAKER_00]: density of that specific plant pressure
that's allowing us to do these inbreeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do this with spider mites,
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy spores of PM and we do this with
every garden pressure that a grower is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to experience so that they have the
greatest tailored offspring when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you do it with all those different
pathogens for every line?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a target, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So every strain, there's a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might do a PM target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also, you know,
hunting for yields or we're hunting for
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes or cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always a different target.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you go and try to target
everything in one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take so much to achieve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in many cases, you're kind of
fighting one with the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of pathogens and pests,
are there ones that are particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting or ones that you prioritize,
I should say?
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely prioritize powdery mildew on
the bacteria side.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the pest side, it's going to probably
be thrips, aphids or fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor growers experience a lot of the
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They experience a lot of the powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get outdoors,
you're seeing, man, you're seeing all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of pests, obviously aphids,
spider mites, rusted mites and things of
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a different target for each
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now do you do environmental pressures
too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly just either pests or bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our rooms are each dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got breeding chambers that we
dial in for more of like, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got strains that we dial in for like
Maine environment compared to Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are East Coast breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're located in North Carolina and New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of what we're doing this
year, last year and years to come is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be more so directed towards the East
Coast.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this plasticity breeding, is that
something that's unique in the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unique for cannabis breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most cannabis breeders,
they're finding a plant that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find another strain that they really
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're crossing the two and they're
selling the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, it's because we're indoors,
we're able to achieve about four years of
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to achieve that in a about two
years in our indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, yeah, a lot of breeders
aren't taking the time to do implement
[SPEAKER_00]: plasticity breeding and creating more of a
homozygous genome with their genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and I was going to kind of circle back
to because when you were sort of talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the process before, you mentioned
S4, which to some folks who are listening
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe some some hosts who are talking
to you in terms of like the S4,
[SPEAKER_01]: F1, all these different sort of letter
number combinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you sort of like walk through the
process and when each of those kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: comes into play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So S is just selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when you're taking a specific
genotype that's a female, you're reversing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you reverse it, you're
having it pollinate itself, creating that
[SPEAKER_00]: first S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're doing this over and over
again until we get to S4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we get to S4, we're then
pairing it with something from our vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something from our vault that
was bred with male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's an F2, maybe it's an F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, we're matching
up two very, very stable strains and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: matching them with each other to create,
you know, a new line and then hunting from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the process of selfing a plant,
what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know when I was looking through
your LinkedIn posts, there was some
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation about different techniques
for creating these feminized seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: how, you know, they're not all equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people don't know this,
but the first feminized seed ever in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world ever created was created through a
process called rodolization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rodolization is a defense mechanism built
into the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so that a female plant will always
produce offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like I said, it's a defense
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, obviously, being in the cannabis
industry, we don't want our female plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to be pollinated, but that's why they have
trichomes and that's why the pistols are
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that neighboring pollen blowing by
sticks to the pistol, retracts down and
[SPEAKER_00]: forms a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the trichomes are sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That female plant once pollen that blows
by to stick to them, retract and form
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens in this rodolization
phase is if you take a plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to reach full maturity and say
eight weeks and you push it to 14 weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will it will actually produce anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those anthers will mature and it will
pollinate itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes for female clones,
feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes for all female cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the first way that a female
feminized seed was ever created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, breeders, we've learned over time
that this creates more more of a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: get more like a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it increases your hermaphrodite
tendencies substantially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you had breeders start to use
colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colloidal silver silver is probably like
the number one product that you see
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed on feminized plants at home to
produce feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone like myself on a commercial scale,
we use silver thysulfate spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something we do differently than any
other breeder I know of is we use an
[SPEAKER_00]: adjuvant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So colloidal silver, you're spraying on a
female plant every single day,
[SPEAKER_00]: repetitively for a long extent period of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver thysulfate spray, you're spraying
about every three to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing it our way, we spray one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made an adjuvant with the silver
thysulfate spray so that that stays active
[SPEAKER_00]: and on the plant for longer without
evaporating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do this so that when we find a
genotype we want to reverse, we're soaking
[SPEAKER_00]: it once with the heavy atomizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, we leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a few weeks, we're starting to
see that reversal take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the benefit of doing it once
versus multiple times other than,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, ease of use for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's really an ease of use
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that we're seeing is we're
seeing more robust anther production as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to spraying silver thysulfate
spray every three to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting this one spray with a very highly
concentration of the silver thysulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: spray, we're just seeing more robust
reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've had reversals that look like
a male and it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes with these reversals,
you don't get as many pollen sacs as you
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to and is like what you would
see on a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with this adjuvant, we see robust
anther production and yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers don't lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now this process of sort of reversing a
plant, is that just for selfing or do you
[SPEAKER_01]: also use that to breed with another plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only for reversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're obviously trying to get pollen from
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, it's going to be live
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have that reverse plant in its
sealed chamber with other female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some cases, what we'll do is we'll
harvest that pollen and either cut it with
[SPEAKER_00]: flour and get it in the freezer or we'll
nitrogen freeze it just depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do that so then we can still have
that same pollen to use down the line in a
[SPEAKER_00]: future project.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know one of the concerns with with
doing this and you know, feminize seeds in
[SPEAKER_01]: general is hermaphrodites like you
mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something about your process or
are there best practices for this to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of make sure that doesn't happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, so we implement a lot of
advanced tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone in the industry, especially
more of your craft at home breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody can implement this,
but we implement marker assisted selection
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also an HPLC lab as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to do our HPLC testing
in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to really shave off a lot of
time that most breeders have to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding to find out which genotype
they're going to carry on, which ones have
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive traits, which ones don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're able to collect a lot of data
from these third party analytics to give
[SPEAKER_00]: us the information we need to make sure
that we're bringing in the right genotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: in when it's time to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So marker assisted selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there specific traits that you've
already identified that you're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: screening for, or are you doing actually
like sequencing to find new and
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting markers and then going from
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're doing sequencing to find new
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right, this is a this is new to the
industry, somewhat new to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we're learning as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wish I mean, most of what we do is
in-house, but for the marker assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: selection in PAR, that's third party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're leaning on them for a lot of
advice with the advanced tools that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've mastered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, we're constantly learning,
constantly evolving, looking for new
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences, new markers to keep an eye out
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then are you using PCR assays to screen
the plants based on those markers?
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering if you could kind of
just like take me through the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: creating a new strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you selecting the plants with a
specific trait in mind, or are you just
[SPEAKER_01]: taking two plants, crossing them and kind
of seeing what comes out and then
[SPEAKER_01]: following the trail from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, each strain is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought back a cut from AK-47 from a
family farm in Durango, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it back and got it initiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then crossed it with a very popular
Michigan strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard of it, Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to create our new strain, which we
called Cream 47, we had to take the Oreos,
[SPEAKER_00]: get it to an F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took our AK-47, which we knew
is a land ray strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that initial upfront cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do that cross, when creating Cream
47, we had a list of markers we wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to hit high trichome density.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted the bag peel to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted some of that creamy kind of Oreo
flavored to come over from the Oreos in
[SPEAKER_00]: that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, it's doing a stem rub on
the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, we're looking at internodal
spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want an indica dominant plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want a sativa dominant plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want a true hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also implementing,
like I said before, which genotypes and
[SPEAKER_00]: which plants are most resistant towards
certain plant pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, it's hard to give a breeder a
rundown of an exact formula for what our
[SPEAKER_00]: targets are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for each strain, we have a
different goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just developed a strain push OG,
which our goal for that was to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: drought resistant, very, very drought
resistant and to be a light feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, it's hard to nail down
exactly what we're looking for for each
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bag appeal, because of the way the
market is right now and the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are trending in the industry, bag appeal
is always a box that we have to check
[SPEAKER_00]: because at the end of the day,
the grower needs to like what they see in
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy and the consumer needs to like
what they see in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when you were talking about doing
the initial cross with I think it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: F3 and then the land race and then so how
many different seeds are you popping?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many plants are you sort of evaluating
and sort of how does it scale from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean, if we're doing if we're
hunting through seed, we're doing about
[SPEAKER_00]: 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I told you before, we're a small indoor
craft sealed facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in an indoor sealed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, we don't have any worries of any
cross contamination or foreign pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in that we're unaware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for what we were just speaking about
the F3 and then you're taking the land
[SPEAKER_00]: race AK 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we make that cross, we will hunt out
about from maybe 200 seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do that because of the stability
with both lines we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we need is about 200 seed to find that
genotype that we want to then sterilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we use axillary node culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually doing a micro splice,
taking that node, sterilizing it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it into vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then depending on how quick we need to
make seed for our new line, it might stay
[SPEAKER_00]: there for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might stay there for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're pulling it out when we need
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that upfront stabilization before you
were putting it into tissue culture makes
[SPEAKER_01]: it so you don't have to hunt as many.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that you're working with a lot
of different cannabis cultivators,
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial home grows, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are a lot of your clients,
are they growing from seed or are they
[SPEAKER_01]: more sort of popping seeds, phenol hunting
and then cloning from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, because we produce type one,
type two and type three genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got hemp farmers that are doing
10,000 seeds at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with our guys that are more rec
medical side of the industry, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be more along the lines of your
type one or type two, they're going to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: like 100 seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to pop 100 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to find the phenotypes that
work best for them and their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're going to get a mom and
they're going to turn it into a mom and
[SPEAKER_00]: cut clones from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers are running either clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone I know running seed is going to be
mainly our hemp farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of our stability with our type
one seeds, we do have some farms that
[SPEAKER_00]: decide they're just going to run seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it really just depends on the
farm we're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do you see that changing at any time
where, you know, more farms will grow
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusively from seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of farms are hunting,
phenol hunting constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage from growing from seed is
you have that initial radical,
[SPEAKER_00]: that little white taproot that comes out
of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's certain hormones that are
produced that allow you to achieve the
[SPEAKER_00]: full genetic potential of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't get that with the clone,
you don't get the radical, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: never with a clone going to achieve the
full genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why a lot of growers favor
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's always going to be split.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've got guys that love growing
from seed, and you've got guys that love
[SPEAKER_00]: growing from clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to continue to kind of
see that trend parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's really a preference
thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I guess circling back to the pathogen
side, and I know it's been an issue
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily with folks who grow from clone,
is hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you worked with that pathogen at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hoplite and viroid is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've personally tested seed from
all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell people the data that we've
tracked is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shown about 82% of what we test is
positive for the hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best place to test is in your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can test the bud, you can test the
leaf, you can test the stem, and it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back negative, and there's hoplite and
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots are the best place to test
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way it shows itself is later in
its progression, you start to see things
[SPEAKER_00]: that look like maybe nutrient
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The limbs start to be a little bit more
brittle, easy to fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very mature state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're losing cannabinoids, you're losing
terpenes, yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big reason why we got into the
tissue culture arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to ensure that everything
we're working with is sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2009, I cultured out the Rosetta
virus out of knockout roses, your
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional knockout rose like you would
see in a neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Rosetta virus, transferred very
similarly to what we see with the hoplite
[SPEAKER_00]: and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our approach with that to get rid
of it is through apical meristem tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, with a very high intensity of UV
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually able to rid that
germplasm of the hoplite and viroid and
[SPEAKER_00]: get it back to its original vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the hoplite and viroid, you know,
it really depends on how strong it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can test it and the efficacy is not
always going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, really, really tricky to
nail down, you know, how how potent is it
[SPEAKER_00]: in that strain that you're working with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's one of the things about
hoplite and viroid is it can affect
[SPEAKER_01]: different varieties differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, have you identified any
varieties that are more resistant to
[SPEAKER_01]: hoplite and viroid than others?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, we're just it's still so new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoplite and viroid has been around for a
while, but on the analytical side,
[SPEAKER_00]: the testing side, the R&D side,
there's so much there's so many more
[SPEAKER_00]: unknowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much more testing and research
and development that needs to be done for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to get to the point to be able to
really lock it in for each strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say like our push OG, I did do a
small experiment in an incubator with the
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did see some resistances,
but it still picked it up and it still
[SPEAKER_00]: tested positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we know, in that earlier state,
plants can still be green, you can still
[SPEAKER_00]: have a solid run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what happens is over time,
it gets worse and worse and worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, it's we're still
learning, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're learning to on the medicinal
genomic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we sell hoplite and viroid tests
for growers and breeders and work with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the top researchers on it,
like Zamir Poonja out in out in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's still a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I know our CSO, he is doing
his own tests with the Jamaican lion
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he saw that you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you're going to find it more more
times, nine times out of 10 is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in some varieties, mainly that one,
it stays in the roots, even in flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: and doesn't even get up, doesn't get up
into the canopy until much later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he is of the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still a lot more research that needs
to be done that that potentially could be
[SPEAKER_01]: a way out of this, you know, having the
have it stay down into the roots and not
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the end product there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, circling back to kind of breeding
what your targets are and what your
[SPEAKER_01]: customers are looking for, you mentioned
bag appeal was always kind of top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: list.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are other traits that, you know,
that growers are looking for or maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that you're looking forward to
for, you know, the next few years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I'm a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been consuming my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's the bag appeal and then
it's the nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many medicinal value,
so much medicinal value that comes with
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes as well as the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: My passion for all of this is because of
my grandfather.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost an o nine to cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, back then all they had was
the marital pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like one of the first legally
synthesized THC pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helped him with radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helped him keep down food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on that end of the spectrum for us,
that's what got us into developing type
[SPEAKER_00]: two varieties is we noticed the bag appeal
and the terpenes were very, very profound
[SPEAKER_00]: with our type two varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, it really depends on are we
breeding a type one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we breeding a type two or are we
breeding a type three?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, those are the three
that we search for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bag appeal, terpenes and plant
resistance are three top that we look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yields are important as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that comes forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you seeing more growers open to
growing type two varieties?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can just tell you from
personally looking at flour that's
[SPEAKER_01]: available where we are, we're in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all type one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find sort of the one to one in
more of your your tinctures, your vapes,
[SPEAKER_01]: your edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of flour, it's just all type
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I would tell you this year,
our top seller were our type twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got them out and disposed in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out and disposed in New York,
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's starting to trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the consumer as well, you know,
for a long time, it's just like potency of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC who can get the highest THC potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with that is the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not the breed of the growers just
rolling it in hash and then getting it
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you see on the label isn't
authentic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think as as the trust and the
education come come to a plateau,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think growers are going to be more and
more interested in growing like type two
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a young dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two little girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I'm a daily consumer,
I like type twos because I still get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still feel euphoric, but I don't have
that impairedness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that slowed reaction,
dry eyes, dry mouth because the CBD truly
[SPEAKER_00]: counteracts that psychotropic effect of
the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got guys in Michigan right now and
they're selling crops twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're running a type two and through
chromatography and winterization,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pulling off the CBD and then
pulling off the THC and getting two turns
[SPEAKER_00]: of revenue on one crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is trending.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the best possible form of
cannabis medicine as a full spectrum plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that has not just THC, but it's got some
other beneficial cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I mean, I think there's really
a big market for for the type two
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how many times I've heard
people say, oh, you know, I've tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: get back into smoking now that it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's just way too strong
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got paranoid or got anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's largely in part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's just too high in the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have that CBD to kind of
counteract and give you a more balanced
[SPEAKER_01]: experience like you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a time and place for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love high THC varieties, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but like I said, there's a time
and place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's sometimes I want to type two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sometimes I want to type one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think as consumers become more
educated, you know, for a while there in
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty eighteen, the hemp industry,
a lot of guys were buying hemp flour and
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing it with their their herb they use
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really enjoying the
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like I said, I think it's kind of
like the hoplite enviroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we just need time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more time, the more education,
you know, the more consumers are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure many other people know as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All about all about education and sharing
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're about here at Can Med.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of wrapping up here, Justin,
I want to give you an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Share with the audience, you know,
anything new coming up with Greenluster
[SPEAKER_01]: Fino's and if they want to learn more
about you and what you do, share any
[SPEAKER_01]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So new and upcoming, we actually have
something really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was in high school, a good
friend of mine, he's first string of the
[SPEAKER_00]: UNC Chapel Hill football team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought back some really,
really nice granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually found a few seeds out of
this batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was we mixed it with flour
and froze it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a genetic freak,
always keeping seeds and seeds of other
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders and from other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, collecting genetics has
always been kind of a hobby of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we popped a few two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we popped these bag seeds,
quote unquote bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we discovered was just
remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females were all poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every female we found, of course,
right, was the flour was poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields were poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found some amazing males that had
amazing stem rubs, really, really heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we use that to create new
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually dropping three new
granddaddy perp number three crosses this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number three was the male we used out
of all the males we planted and got in
[SPEAKER_00]: vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just big fan leaves, really nice
stem rub, great internetal spacing,
[SPEAKER_00]: very hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we created three new crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crossed our wintery fruit, which was
our top seller in 2018, 2019 and 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crossed your famous ice cream cake,
and then we crossed a lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon haze was from greenhouse,
greenhouse seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're super excited for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's an amazing thing to
experience something when you're younger,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then to be able to bring it back,
grow it, and it's identical to what it was
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really excited for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what Greenluster Finos
has coming up this year, hoping to release
[SPEAKER_00]: those in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do a breeders cut as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know,
anyone watching our breeders cut is just
[SPEAKER_00]: when we pull one out of vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that I selected personally,
out of hundreds and hundreds of genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you know, a lot of growers,
a lot of commercial operators,
[SPEAKER_00]: craft cultivators, they're having to pop
these seeds and spend nine months,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes 12 months, finding the right
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: To turn into a mom with our breeders cut,
we do all the work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fully rooted and we overnight ship
for free anywhere in the USA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in terms of if growers want to do
their own breeding project with your
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, is that that cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's that's how this industry
exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the greatest varieties we
have were produced by other breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: not by produce by myself, but by other
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the more the more, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we want more breeders to use our
germplasm and cross it with what they have
[SPEAKER_00]: and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now coming back to the bag seed,
because that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that the females weren't so
hot, but the but the males looked great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that typical with bag seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, well, we don't do a lot of bag
seed hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have a few where I got some herb
and I really liked it and there happened
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a seed and I kept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not normally, you know,
doing projects from bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why this is such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I mean, I would say normally we
find females that are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, you know, we'll find some
males that are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we're hunting feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we're not really finding males.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, it was a it was a male
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really won with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again, Justin, for taking the time
to talk to us today about about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to see you down at Canmed this
June.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for having us on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we're looking to looking forward
to being out there in Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
