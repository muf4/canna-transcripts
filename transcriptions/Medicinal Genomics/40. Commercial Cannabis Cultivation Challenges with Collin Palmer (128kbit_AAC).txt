[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head over to canmedevents.com now to learn
all about our CanMed 2022 event,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will take place May 3rd through 5th
at the Pasadena Convention Center in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pasadena, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This three day event begins with a full
day medical practicum led by Dr. Bonnie
[SPEAKER_00]: Goldstein, the practicum's originator,
as well as Dr. Dustin Sulak, Dr. Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: Spellman, and Eloise Thiessen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of the presenters will share the
latest research as well as their clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and practice guidelines related
to cannabinoid therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new section of this eight hour course is
dedicated to reviewing different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions, products, and optimal dosing
for cannabinoid therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we have two full days of
presentations and panel discussions
[SPEAKER_00]: covering the latest research in the
cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and safety testing taking place May 4th
and 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full schedule is up at canmedevents

[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, we welcome Colin Palmer,
who is the Chief Experience Officer at
[SPEAKER_00]: Vessel Life Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin has been obsessed with growing
cannabis since he started growing in his
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard at 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, he has consulted with many
cannabis companies on a variety of areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: including genetic selection, lab
optimization, product development,
[SPEAKER_00]: branding, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the past several years, he has worked
on bringing that experience to Vessel Life
[SPEAKER_00]: Science, which has been focused on working
with several brands to bring new
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless products to market in 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we cover Colin's
journey in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting with his first plants to his
current projects, the education and
[SPEAKER_00]: mentorship he received from cannabis
cultivation pioneers, how regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: create barriers for legacy growers to
participate in the current cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, how business pressures stifle
innovation from commercial cultivators and
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage copycat tactics, why THC and CBD
values alone do a poor job of describing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products, the fact that how and
when cannabis is harvested, cured,
[SPEAKER_00]: and dried can influence taste and
experience for the user, why plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens seem to be more prevalent now
than ever before, how plant pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially hoplite and viroid,
can destroy a cultivation business,
[SPEAKER_00]: subtle cues that hoplite and viroid
infected plants can show, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Colin, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Fino Express.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fino Express offers low-cost genetic
testing services to cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using QPCR technology, Fino Express helps
cultivators identify genetic traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as plant sex, while plants are still
in the seedling tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also identify plant pathogens,
such as hoplite and viroid, lettuce,
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorosis virus, and powdery mildew,
before plants show obvious signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact Fino Express today so they can
help you predict, prevent, and eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: major crop problems before they happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more about how you can accelerate
your Fino hunt with Fino Express,

[SPEAKER_00]: That's P-H-E-N-O-X-P-R-E-S-S dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Colin
[SPEAKER_00]: Palmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to talk with you
today because I know you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in a lot of different areas of
cannabis cultivation, from breeding to
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could even call it from seed to sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in our email exchange,
before we started recording, we identified
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of different topics that we want
to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought before we get into that,
a good way to get started, it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate for you to tell the listeners
a bit about yourself, how you got started
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry, and what you're doing
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis plant has been a part of my
life since I've been a young guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: being 15, 16 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started growing my first plants really
in an amateur style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of way, being influenced off of books
from Mel Frank and things that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of pop culture kind of influenced me
from the Grateful Dead scene to the fish
[SPEAKER_01]: scene, and of course, other styles of
music like jazz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I got really excited about
plants at a really young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis was, to me at the time,
really the ultimate plant to explore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of, it was very apparent
very quickly that there was a lot to this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular plant and a lot to explore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, whether that be different types of
varieties or just the plant morphology in
[SPEAKER_01]: general was very interesting at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really drove me into looking and
reading and researching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it drove me to places like
laughingmoon.com, which was run by a
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian group, which kind of formed into
overgrow.com from the British Columbia
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were people like Vic High and
Subcool and Dave Watson, Robert Clark,
[SPEAKER_01]: and several other individuals that were
posting information that I could quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: grab onto and start to read and start to
iterate on my own version of what that was
[SPEAKER_01]: at a young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, immediately I've been an
artist my whole life and I started
[SPEAKER_01]: studying horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a really serious way as I got into my
20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to school for art and design and
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I studied organic chemistry during
that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to school in New York and had a
really big deep dive into that world of
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at, you know, just organic
chemistry in a really open-minded way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what led me to cannabinoid
distraction and really starting to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about what that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I immediately started washing
hash in 1999.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my first forte into actually
extracting any type of cannabinoid from
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and any type of chemical,
you know, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, you know, those days it was a
hot wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, ice and water,
middle of the day, or mixing with a wooden
[SPEAKER_01]: spoon or a spoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're drying it in these large
patties, creating pretty much charrus,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a, you know, a type of hash
that's a cured resin, that's an air-dried
[SPEAKER_01]: resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through that time, you know,
you started, you know, started noticing
[SPEAKER_01]: the nuances of extraction through that
simple process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also got my curiosity into
solvent-based extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started, you know, playing with
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as the other types of
extractions came around, I was naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: just interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But circling that back into where I began
and why, you know, it was really the idea
[SPEAKER_01]: of art and science merging together that
really caught my attention to this is
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, plants were like art.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow these things and they're
immediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Art is very immediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very immediate function that you
and reward that you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: give yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really enjoyed that simple pleasure
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the idea of growing lots
of different varieties at a young age came
[SPEAKER_01]: into play because it was very fascinating
to see a California orange next to a skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: or an NL5, you know, sitting next to a
strawberry cough or a sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could see the, not only the
polymorphic, you know, differences,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the aromic properties and the actual,
you know, just the presence of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: structure itself really was immediate in
terms of the reward that you saw and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the exchange of information between,
you know, comparing and contrasting those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really just drawn me in or drew me
into the world of just getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: reading everything that Dave Watson had,
you know, put out and Skunk Man Sam had
[SPEAKER_01]: put out and diving into Robert Clark's
literature and then going even further,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, going into real, you know,
looking at white papers that I could find
[SPEAKER_01]: and ultimately becoming friends with,
you know, Marcus Richardson, who's a dear
[SPEAKER_01]: friend of mine and somewhat of a mentor at
an early age of all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were exchanging lots of information and
yeah, so it just kind of snowballed from
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but it was really the intent and
the ideology that we could learn more
[SPEAKER_01]: about this plant and it was immediate and
we could actually react to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That simple thing actually through the
years, you know, grew into what I would
[SPEAKER_01]: consider today an actual business,
which I didn't really plan for at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't, you know, I never really,
it's not that I didn't believe,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really know where this was all
headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew at some point we would be able
to grow these plants in mass population as
[SPEAKER_01]: we see today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, you know, there's more people
growing this plant than there ever has
[SPEAKER_01]: ever in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, with that comes what we see
of an industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the good, bad, ugly and,
you know, there's the legacy farmers and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's the new, you know,
individuals that are coming into the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that are now interested because
of, you know, interests that are beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, you know, quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the plant is a part of it,
but the driving factor is not the plant in
[SPEAKER_01]: most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you started when you were 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must've had either some understanding
parents or some parents who weren't paying
[SPEAKER_00]: much attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some parents that were understanding
and also cautious at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, you know, my dad was
really encouraging and he, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: he didn't actually believe that I could
manage all of it, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he saw all of it, he kind of
chuckled and said, well, at least you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're good at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you know, I was obsessive,
you know, like every day after school,
[SPEAKER_01]: straight to the patch, you know,
and this is outdoor at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the indoor was really difficult
at the time, you know, a young guy like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you're not growing under lights like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I would say is it was all I
thought about, all I could think about
[SPEAKER_01]: every day, day in and day out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That art and music were the three things
for me that were just all encompassing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all I cared about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still to this day, it's quite frankly,
it's all I truly care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's interesting,
you know, it's like music, cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: are really dynamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like harmonics, you have this moment
where things come together and dissipate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's cannabinoids to me in a
nutshell after you've combusted them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or you utilize them for
delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they have this beautiful
harmonic frequency that they bring to your
[SPEAKER_01]: body and your body is able to grab onto it
through endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very individual, just again,
just like how sound travels to your
[SPEAKER_01]: nervous systems and the rest of your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that said, you know, I had an
opportunity to build a company in the
[SPEAKER_01]: state of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spent, you know, the past three,
four years of my life dedicating my time
[SPEAKER_01]: and to bringing all of the things that
I've researched and consulted on,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was a consultant before I went
after my own license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was working with several different
outfits to optimize their workflow,
[SPEAKER_01]: lab workflow, their SKU creation,
you know, their branding, their go to
[SPEAKER_01]: market strategies, how a product sits in a
market and why that said SKU should be
[SPEAKER_01]: made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things that need answers to that,
you know, be surprised not many people
[SPEAKER_01]: have answers to them in the market today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a big, big white space
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there continues to be because of the
spirit of cannabinoids is still widely
[SPEAKER_01]: under really understudied and
underutilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, we have products, we have we have
things that we grab onto, such as tack
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, the the ideology of
terpenes in by volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are widely understudied and
under underutilized in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: quantitative and qualitative results.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so when you look at these
things, you know, we were at this moment
[SPEAKER_01]: in the industry, there's a really great
opportunity for innovation and and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, expansion in the terms of
product SKUs and offering and delivery for
[SPEAKER_01]: the human.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really aren't where most individuals
want us, you know, believe that we are,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really far ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have very sophisticated delivery
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's it's going to take
some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take the right minds to come
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have a culture, but we don't study
toxicology in these these environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We study the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We study the chemicals that grow on the
plant and optimize those chemicals to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, so we can then utilize them for
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's there's so much more to
explore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's it's a really exciting
time because I think everyone has an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to really have a voice right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the industry really needs needs
innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're I feel like we're kind of
stuck in a vacuum in a lot of respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I think it's interesting you say
that that, you know, maybe the industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: not as far as long as we like to think
that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do you where would you like to
see it see it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see us go into more,
you know, real research on on these
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals and better testing standards
for, you know, building the right testing
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures to actually tell the larger and
more detailed story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, it seems like we're about five
percent of the chemicals we're we're
[SPEAKER_01]: testing for about five percent right now,
it seems, you know, based on what what is
[SPEAKER_01]: known that is there on the plant versus
what the test results that we get back
[SPEAKER_01]: from these labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't really give you much
insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's very tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even top line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's just very overview and very
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to see a standardization,
but I also want don't through that through
[SPEAKER_01]: that lens, I don't believe we should be
hindering labs because they need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: developing new standards along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we need to agree on something,
but we also need to let them innovate and
[SPEAKER_01]: and collaborate with policymakers to help
them understand the intricacies of testing
[SPEAKER_01]: for these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I see, you know, a lot of
different states have a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of mandates for different
requirements that they have in their rules
[SPEAKER_01]: and regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if we can't all agree on
something behind the scenes, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic state to state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just it really becomes difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an operator in Florida,
you have SOPs that are specific to that
[SPEAKER_01]: state and those mandates you go to
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those the same SOPs and how do you
standardize a product across markets if
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have the standardization,
you know, from a from a testing
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'd also like it to go
into, you know, just want to add this is
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, there's a lot of legacy
growers that put more work in than they
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually talk about in a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the the path that they've walked is a
path that has been extremely stressful and
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous for them and their families and
their communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel that sometimes, yes,
it's hard to run a business and not
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's fit to run a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's hard to swallow when we
don't have a path for people to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: business in a market or if you want to
call it a state or whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: call it for these individuals to live on
and to pass those torches on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're talking about
generational growers and individuals have
[SPEAKER_01]: kept these varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: That a lot of these big box individuals
are coming in and just getting a cut for
[SPEAKER_01]: five, six, six hundred thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden they have a brand,
too, and they're growing the same
[SPEAKER_01]: varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's it's tough to swallow
that that there's, you know, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: really no one to help the dying breed of
community and and culture that that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, legacy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a good example of that is is where
we're at in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, if we can have
better policy, better cooperation from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how things had run from two
fifteen to sixty four to where it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: now, I think the conversation could be
steered and we get to have a better future
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot of these individuals that are
truly, truly here for the plan,
[SPEAKER_01]: truly here for the best resin,
the best terpene that they can they can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow on a plant and the fullest expression
of these these specific varietals that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to see a path for everyone to
participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legacy, the corporations, the,
you know, the niche, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's what I'd like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much of it is sort of over
regulation, creating barriers,
[SPEAKER_00]: for some of these, like you said,
legacy growers or those who don't have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, endless funding to sort of pay
for all the necessary licenses or
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements that the regulators set
forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how much of that is the issue with
kind of gatekeeping these folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's I think it's a lot of over
regulation in terms of the the steps you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go to get to market and what you
have to pay for to get that product in
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the the pit stops of of that cost
structure, meaning if I pay for testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I'm making water hash, let me just use
an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm testing the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm testing the water hash and I'm testing
the rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's three touch points of rosin or
testing that could be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: half the cost of the overall grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if you're not doing large
batches, the state is going to tax you
[SPEAKER_01]: based on that number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the times that you're testing and then
it has to go to distribution and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: to do their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's there's there's too many pit
stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cost to do these things amounts
to, you know, just pricing yourself right
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I think that that's the
biggest problem, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the cost of, you know,
cost per gram now is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's strong in some states, but really
weak in others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard when, you know,
a farmer's been doing this for a really
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden, you know,
yeah, they might be making a pound for
[SPEAKER_01]: 450.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, but by the time they add up
labor and testing costs and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else, they're more like 750, you know,
and that's a really difficult thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: swallow as a business that is growing and
young.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like I was young once,
too, I I learned a lot about business
[SPEAKER_01]: through lots of trial and error,
you know, and, you know, I'm fortunate to
[SPEAKER_01]: have come out the other end really sound
and better for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I didn't have catastrophic
events happen where everything is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's what I see just the way
it's evolved is there's a lot of pit stops
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you have to deal with
distribution, which is kind of its own
[SPEAKER_01]: beast in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, these things need to be
streamlined so individuals can get product
[SPEAKER_01]: to market where they're not taxing
themselves literally out of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to switch gears a little bit and
start talking about genetics, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: know you've got quite a collection of
cultivars or amassed one over the years,
[SPEAKER_00]: including some rare genetics and land race
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of you talk about like, what are some
of your favorite cuts that you have or
[SPEAKER_00]: that that are out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you kind of talk about what
we're seeing in the marketplace in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I say we're in a vacuum,
I think I think I'm really talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: that from not only a product perspective,
but also a varietal perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we let pop culture drive a lot
of our decisions as humans around us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the instance that we're in
right now, there's certain players in the
[SPEAKER_01]: game and certain individuals that are
really pushing their point of view in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of what they believe is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's resonating with everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back to the music analogy,
there's trends that come along.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's styles of music and there's styles
of genetics that are going to come along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all going to start doing that
type of style to stay current,
[SPEAKER_01]: to stay contemporary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis has, just like music,
has vintage varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has classic varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the backbone, the language in which
we are the building blocks, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: of it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your your your NL fives and your
skunk one and your haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then moving forward from your haze,
you have your modern haze, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Herrera, which is kind of been you
know, again, that's another bridle that is
[SPEAKER_01]: in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it kind of this turps that
turpinoline just kind of took over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Herrera is probably, you know,
kind of, you know, making a joke about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's kind of like the first kind of
influencer, you know, that was Ben Donkers
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of took Jack Herrera and utilized him
as an influencer and created the varietal
[SPEAKER_01]: around him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really to curb the sativa to
be more commercial, to be a 16,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12, 16 week variety could be could be
actually 11, 12 weeks, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, genetics today,
you know, I think we're getting a little
[SPEAKER_01]: not bottlenecked, but, you know,
I think just in the commercial sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all growing the same things and
we're all trying to package them
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're predominantly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, yeah, this guy may have
used more sugars at week seven than the
[SPEAKER_01]: next, but predominantly at scale in a
commercial setting, you know, there's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: all the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go on everyone's menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a version of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, look, the cannabis is it's
such a vast I mean, look at the canapedia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a vast sea of amazing chemotypes
and phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder, yes, I understand in
commercial that we have to stay within
[SPEAKER_01]: certain scheduling, but I always wonder
why we pigeonhole ourselves to try to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to get things out onto a market to just
stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, listen, I I'm a true
believer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not innovating, you're dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're just buying and growing the
same cuts everybody else is, that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: innovating to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and there's just so much good
stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have older land race stuff
that I was gifted that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would still consider a hybrid of sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sure, it's it's quote,
air quotes, land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see the expressions out of
these plants that they're they're robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have great resin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, you know, terpene profiles are
super intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a bit more spicy and a bit
different than, you know, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: contemporary varietals, but they're very
special, very different in terms of how
[SPEAKER_01]: they produce and all the things that go
along with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would love to see people start to
explore, you know, just new new avenues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the thing that's really
interesting to me is like flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this idea of flavors are all being
repackaged and represented to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, none of this stuff is really
new in terms of taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all these flavors have been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when GMO came through,
it was just like a really great super scum
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just started really
producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had this really dank, you know,
beautiful, you know, Chem D feel to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was tight and better, better,
you know, tighter structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the Girl Scout cookie came
in on that as an example of the
[SPEAKER_01]: contemporary variety that everyone grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, most of these things are grown
time and time again, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulturally sound to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's why people love to hate on
Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, if you've ever grown that
variety, it's it's pretty great to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, do I do I think there's much
better things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but in that moment, you see why you're
like, Oh, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a growers plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the flip side, OG Kush is not really
a growers plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really sparse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It falls over all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs lots of support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in commercial settings,
those plants are hard to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they don't yield much, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point is, is that there's a lot to
explore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of great breeders out there
today that we just didn't have before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you could really count them on
your hands for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was really, that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And beyond that was like, you know,
of course, you know, the common turn a
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen chucker, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, let's face it, most of our
contemporary and, you know, varietals that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have seen through the 90s were all bag
seed, Chem 91, Chem 4, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 1, you know, Sour D, all these things
were not actually bred by someone
[SPEAKER_01]: intentionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were people that were good stewards
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I, you know, I encourage
people to explore, explore the bag seed
[SPEAKER_01]: that you were going to throw out,
grow seeds and, you know, be a good
[SPEAKER_01]: champion and good steward of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying you're going to find the
next Chem D, but I think it's good to live
[SPEAKER_01]: in that world of, I want to explore and,
you know, in the world of discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like from what you're
saying, that sort of all the overhead,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the additional testing, all the
licenses is sort of stifling innovation,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you want to grow these plants that
are going to yield the most and that are
[SPEAKER_00]: proven winners in retail too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're going to, they're going to
sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of the appetite to really put
yourself out there and take a risk is not
[SPEAKER_00]: really there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when you have, you have
people to answer to, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a company that has a set
schedule and you only have a set amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms, you can only produce a set amount
of pounds per month per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to stick to the schedule because
that's tied to other things that are way
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of creativity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are, these are hardline things that
don't incorporate creativity, but I have
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to remind everyone and invite them to
say, look, then you need to build
[SPEAKER_01]: creativity into the business plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you don't have it, then what are
you truly doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just, you know, is that,
is that, is that what you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing I would, you know,
I truly look at a lot as how people are
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the world around them and the
space that they occupy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, again, it's, retail is
predominantly not all that different than
[SPEAKER_01]: one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to another shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a different registers and to the
left instead of the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there might be a touch screen in that
corner instead of the left-hand side
[SPEAKER_01]: corner, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But predominantly the education isn't
really there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have the language quite yet
to be educational on a sales floor and to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to talk about a varietal in a way
that actually does its justice,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is, is really, it's tough,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, it's something that I,
I really hope that we can get a good
[SPEAKER_01]: handle on in the next, you know,
five to 10 years and start to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: language around, you know, the right way
to talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's really hard, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as much as we all think we know,
we just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and you're spot on with, you know,
the retail experience being, being very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can only speak really to here in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it might be different in other
States, but I mean, you look, you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the menus and it's all the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only really reporting on THC CBD
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even really talk about the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's sort of like, how am I
supposed to know if one's better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's all THC dominant too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you rarely ever see a one-to-one or
any other even just different ratios of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD to THC, let alone terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a huge vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be exploring more cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, to your point, to the
one-to-one point, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one-to-one, two-to-one, three-to-one,
20-to-one, you know, 40-to-one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, listen, there's a lot of,
there's lots to be explored with how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids interact with one another and
then how that interaction interacts with
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to your point here, THCA and TH-9 has
ruled the game, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, is the selling, quantitative
selling point for, for budtenders right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say this out loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is completely a false sense of
reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not going to tell you anything
about what that varietal is going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: for you individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: At all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to give you a glimpse into what
the testing told you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What could possibly be there by mass,
by weight, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, furthermore, it's not
telling you how that variety was taken
[SPEAKER_01]: down or trimmed or cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are the trichome heads cloudy or
amber?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like this are, are, are widely left
out of the conversation and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest date.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when was it harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you buy, do you buy based on expiration
date?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you go into Whole Foods,
you buy based on expiration date and the
[SPEAKER_01]: back label, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the unfortunate part about cannabis is
we can't lead with the back label quite
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that what we can do is we can
look at the chemical properties by volume
[SPEAKER_01]: and generally start to draw these
correlations between what your bioassay is
[SPEAKER_01]: telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can start physically kind of,
you know, interacting with this product in
[SPEAKER_01]: a way that tells you the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think that there is value in the
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to start looking at it
from an educational standpoint and better,
[SPEAKER_01]: build better language around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the bud tenders that we give these
amazing products to can actually talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about them and have a person walk away
with some type of substance that allows
[SPEAKER_01]: them to be better educated and better for
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a great point you make about how
it was aged or how it was cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I always sort of draw the
analogy, whether appropriate or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: to alcohol, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of whiskey products are
marketed based on how they were aged,
[SPEAKER_00]: which type of barrels they were put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, the whole concept shouldn't
really be foreign to people that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: be looking past just data points that come
out of the lab, that there's more to the
[SPEAKER_00]: end product than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, back to this one-to-one
thing, I want to touch on that just one
[SPEAKER_01]: more time is one of my favorite varieties
for searching for those types of things is
[SPEAKER_01]: the work that Ringo did, Ringo's gift and
the varieties that have come off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harlequin is another one from Wade Lafter.
[SPEAKER_01]: House of Harlequin has been a staple,
I think, in those types of ratios of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and the work that he has put
in over the years to make sure that those
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties are in circulation is really
inspiring and stellar work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Cannatonic is another great
variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there's quite a few, and that's just
me, you know, throwing a few out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, those are some varieties I
think would be great to explore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of possibilities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, kind of going back to that whole idea
of drawing the parallels to alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you ever envision a future will have
something that's similar to, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, craft beer, where we have more craft
cannabis, like these smaller growers who
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe do smaller batches of these more
unique varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it doesn't sound like, given the
climate today, that that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: feasible, but, you know, potentially that
would be, I mean, that'd be great,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, boutique cannabis is,
you know, cannabis is a perishable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say it started saying that,
had to get that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a perishable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's a point when you do
have too much, you know, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's something not everyone has the
foresight to check themselves on.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they start looking at balance sheets
and, you know, pounds per month,
[SPEAKER_01]: it starts to, you know, you get in a
different mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I invite everyone to look at this from
a more practical standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, ask yourself, could we be
better for it if we focus on other things
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than more?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, look at the industrial age.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mediocre products for a mediocre
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that shouldn't be cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, you know, sure, there's people
that want that angle, and you have to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of ask yourself who you want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you know, I think that there's a
world where craft cannabis is what people
[SPEAKER_01]: truly want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the world that we're
going to, that will shape up eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we can learn from all the
other markets that have developed around
[SPEAKER_01]: us, and, you know, specifically a federal
market, you know, going big is not has not
[SPEAKER_01]: really worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, growing an ornamental crop
like cannabis is very difficult at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to be, you know, your teams
have to be firing off and on cylinders,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody has to be in great
communication, the system has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: running great.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most all cases, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's problematic,
I think for high quality cannabis and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of these things that we've been speaking
about, which is getting bulbous and
[SPEAKER_01]: capitate sessile and capitate stock,
you know, resin glands to grow in large
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts and the nascent chemicals to grow
within them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have to have, you know,
you start at 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything you do wrong knocks a point
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, whether it's
environmental in your VPD or PPFD,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you don't, you don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of these things together have to
be in harmony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that harmonics has to come together
together in a really methodical way to
[SPEAKER_01]: make high quality cannabis at scale
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think the world's seen that
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've seen some pretty,
you know, some pretty great things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the the industry is evolving in a
really interesting way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of a lot of room there
for improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I invite everyone to look at,
you know, just because you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: should you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a good point about,
you know, growing at scale and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: going back to this whole idea of,
you know, everyone's growing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much of that is that because,
you know, if you were growing all
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of varieties, you're going
to have to have them in different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments that are sort of best suited
for those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, that's just that's just not
going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in terms of genetics,
you know, look, we're super far away from
[SPEAKER_01]: this idea of standardization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there are teams that aren't
sharing the information that I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: about, which is entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always say this, if you're thinking
about it, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it we've a long way to go to say
that these varieties should be grown in
[SPEAKER_01]: these regions at these temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have just a lot of data to collect and
a lot of breeding to do to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetics in a place like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I hope one day we have some
ideology around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't at the same time, I want to
say this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I don't in the in the pursuit of
standardization, let's not lose sight of
[SPEAKER_01]: creativity in the fact that F1's and the
idea of of not leaving an F1 is is
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think that the industry is
pigeonholed itself to not go past F1
[SPEAKER_01]: because people are just moving on too
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to standard, you know, stabilize
something to have something that's truly
[SPEAKER_01]: unique in uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, we have we're a long
ways away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess another thing that kind of
just struck me, too, is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you know, until the industry sort of
keeps up and they're able to to innovate
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow these different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess there's always the option
to grow yourself, right, to home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good way to express or to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should grow at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone should have plants at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they, you know, look, growing
cannabis is very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an easy task.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important for people to
understand, understand that it's it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: again, back to music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like music.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grab a guitar from from a guitar
center, but you still have to learn how to
[SPEAKER_01]: play it before you get in front of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's similar here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to learn and go through it and
understand what what spider mites are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nowadays, what what PM looks like,
you know, and what the Hoplade and Viroid
[SPEAKER_01]: might look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these are all things that,
you know, those are two newer things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we didn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: As prevalent back in the early 2000s and
late 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are things that you have to go
through, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes, listen, you can grow some
amazing stuff and you can have your own
[SPEAKER_01]: your own version of what you see around
you in pop culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned PM and Hoplade and Viroid
kind of being these newer issues on the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene that cultivators have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I was more familiar with Hoplade
and Viroid sort of being newer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was interesting to hear that PM
wasn't as much of an issue years ago when
[SPEAKER_00]: you were first getting started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, you know, I yeah, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those types of diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not, you know, I was not aware of,
you know, in, let's say, ninety nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: two thousand, two thousand one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's when I started reading
more about powdery mildew and seeing more
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew being passed around through
cuts or friends that were saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, my whole grows bond out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where products like Green Cure
came in and, you know, sulfur and all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things were being talked about at a
time like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, was PM a disease that's been
identified?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for myself and other growers,
we were not as as infected by things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, you'd see the case of, like,
you know, mites and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we didn't have russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have these superbugs that took
out whole gardens in the matter of 72
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's you know, those types of things
were really new at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, of course,
we made all kinds of bad mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody used Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, gosh, it was it was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and again, this is all because
we didn't have anyone to talk to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's if we had a bigger pipeline of
communication, everyone could have been
[SPEAKER_01]: better educated at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just weren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's highly contributed to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then fast forward to today with hot
blade and viroid, you know, we had
[SPEAKER_01]: identified a couple of plants that came
from a nursery in California that were hot
[SPEAKER_01]: for HLBP and with hot blade and viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's it's it's
heartbreaking to see things like that
[SPEAKER_01]: because we don't have the right guidance
that's publicly available and a roadmap
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't cost you 12 months and and 15
K to get a varietal clean again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best answers I've gotten were
called the plant today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could go into the deep dive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how, you know, as a community,
do we start to talk about this and have
[SPEAKER_01]: dialogue on it to help help each other not
have this type of viroid wreak havoc on
[SPEAKER_01]: your businesses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because cannabis has always been kind of
loose, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's weed, we grow plants,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today, it's not loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there's margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that have their whole lives
on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a viroid like this will wipe out your
whole business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from growing these plants and studying
a hot blade and viroid and confined spaces
[SPEAKER_01]: and having my own bioassay with it,
as I call it, you can see how it performs
[SPEAKER_01]: and adversely could totally ruin
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the way that the flower structure
grows on these plants versus plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have it is night and day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you didn't know what you were
looking for, you would never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just say, oh, that's a low yielding
yielding plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the way she is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, she's you know, they didn't produce
enough terpenes this run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, it's because it's sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does a human perform when you're sick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the plant supposed to perform when
they're sick?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the things that we have to be
really we have to be looking out for not
[SPEAKER_01]: only ourselves, but each other,
because one day you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: cut from your buddy who's going to be
happily giving it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to then grow it and start
cloning other things with it, not even
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing because it's your buddy and you
trust your buddy and your buddy is just a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's unbeknownst to him, he's passing,
you know, hot blade and viroid to your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a domino effect of just great
intentions with the worst outcome,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I see today is,
you know, nurseries, they have all the
[SPEAKER_01]: best intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we all do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have great intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if if we're not checking ourselves and
that's why I think, you know, the work
[SPEAKER_01]: that medicinal genomics is doing is super
important to the future of where
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and horticulture is going for
cannabis, because we need to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: insight to be able to make better
decisions that are educated based on
[SPEAKER_01]: cleanliness, vigor and fit to perform.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if these things aren't done,
one day we might find sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 91 and Chem D completely out of our
language because the last man standing got
[SPEAKER_01]: got HLV because he took a cut from his
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, and that is sort of the
most, at least in my mind, the most kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of insidious thing about it is that it's
so like you said, unless you knew what you
[SPEAKER_00]: were looking for, you wouldn't you
wouldn't know you even had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, things like PM, it's pretty
obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have white splotches all
over your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, I got PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a plant in viral, it's a lot harder to
identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's from a visual standpoint,
there are cues that I've been learning
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plant will give you like like
your stems or just snap like clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: like surgical clean bone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snap right in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like cucumber almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a cucumber snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start to pick up on these these
these cues that six plants, a sick plant
[SPEAKER_01]: will give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, there's no real literature that
will say that it's definitively can be
[SPEAKER_01]: eradicated from the plant quite yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's some and if someone does
out there on this on the solicitor,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd love I'd love to speak with you
on to how you're approaching, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: eradication, because, you know,
most of the things we see are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, therapies and different,
you know, TC and Maristem, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: paths to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there's been no definitive
evidence that it doesn't come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is probably a dumb question,
but I'm going to ask it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read that it's not common for HLVD to be
passed through seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about sort of selfing a sick plant
and trying to grow from those seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there's I think I think
that needs to be studied more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I I've I've heard that,
you know, five percent of the seed could
[SPEAKER_01]: be infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I it's really who knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's that's the the larger
honest answer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that the larger populations
and studies, larger studies need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: done to better identify what is being
passed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, again, it needs a host.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how is the seed going to be a host?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so there's a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that, you know, that's a
really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not sure if an S1 would do
the trick, but I think it's something
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, again, we need we need
more long term studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some we need to really understand
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a lot of work to be done on
that front.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely do want to be mindful of your
time, Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks so much for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I let you go, I want to give
you a chance to plug any website,
[SPEAKER_00]: social media, any way people can get in
touch with you or follow what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can you can follow me on Vessel
Life Science on Instagram and Vessel Life
[SPEAKER_01]: Science dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a we are extractionists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cultivators and we are building
different SKU offerings and different
[SPEAKER_01]: brands in the marketplace through the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really excited to be working with
an in particular company to date that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing some really great projects
together that will release solveness
[SPEAKER_01]: products in the markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should see some products next year
start to trickle out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the meantime, we're focusing
heavily on genetic R&D, formulation R&D
[SPEAKER_01]: and innovation and on on all those fronts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if people want to reach out
to us, please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to collaborate with anyone
that's interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when those products start coming out,
we'll have to have you back on again,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we didn't even we didn't even
touch on solventless extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be for another podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solventless extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our it's our that's our number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
