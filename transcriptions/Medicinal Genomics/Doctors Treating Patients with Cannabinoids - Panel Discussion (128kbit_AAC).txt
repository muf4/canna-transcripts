[SPEAKER_14]: We have got one over here on the left.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Kirsten.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here again, everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like you guys to give us just your
overview, not so much about AEA,
[SPEAKER_12]: 2AG, or the phytocannabinoids,
but about upregulation of CB1,
[SPEAKER_12]: CB2, and possibly even TRPV-1.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if there's a method or an analysis of
those receptors, or maybe people just
[SPEAKER_12]: don't upregulate, there might be something
that you guys have to say about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just briefly touched on a study from a
couple months ago that was using PET scans
[SPEAKER_10]: to look at CB1 receptor densities in
people that had tolerance to THC-based
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis, and they found that after two
days of abstinence, those receptors came
[SPEAKER_10]: back to normal level.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we know that CB1 agonists can
downregulate the CB1 receptors,
[SPEAKER_10]: and we know that taking a break from those
agonists can upregulate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's probably other ways to upregulate
it as well, which are covered in Dr.
[SPEAKER_10]: McPartlin's paper that Ethan just
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd add something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that heretofore, there's been too
much concentration on THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you ask me what drug would upregulate
the system over time, it would be
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when used chronically, it does seem to
increase the gain of the system and help
[SPEAKER_05]: with so many aspects of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beyond that, and again, from John's paper,
you have aerobic activity seems to
[SPEAKER_05]: upregulate the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's good evidence that the runner's
high is an endocannabinoid mechanism
[SPEAKER_05]: rather than related to endogenous opioids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, the prebiotic probiotics
may figure into this in a big way.
[SPEAKER_05]: They seem to produce many of the same
benefits on illnesses that cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_05]: will, for example.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was wondering if, I use cannabis
topically for pain, and I was wondering if
[SPEAKER_11]: you have ever administered it or had
somebody use it for skin cancer.
[SPEAKER_11]: For what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Skin cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there've been many attestations on
the web of curing or eliminating skin
[SPEAKER_05]: lesions, including cancers with
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: This really, what's amusing to me is that
this isn't new.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been reported for hundreds of
years in other cultures.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that we forget history,
and because they didn't have double-blind
[SPEAKER_05]: controlled studies then, nobody pays any
attention to them currently.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's clear that cannabidiol in
many of the phytocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_05]: not just THC and CBD, have this ability to
kill cancer cells in high concentrations
[SPEAKER_05]: while being preservative for normal cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a great deal more work in a palatable
form.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, the double-blind
controlled studies need to be done so that
[SPEAKER_05]: the rest of the medical community will
accept these results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jeff Block, University of Miami.
[SPEAKER_04]: A question probably for Dr. Sulak.
[SPEAKER_04]: The two-day abstinence considering perhaps
a longer time for chronic down-regulated
[SPEAKER_04]: patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you share with us how you rate the two
days, and if in fact you may miss a full,
[SPEAKER_04]: healthy retrieval of a naive system to
work from?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that any program is going to
be the optimal program for everyone,
[SPEAKER_10]: but based on the work I was doing about
five years ago when I was asking people to
[SPEAKER_10]: take different lengths of abstinence
breaks, it seemed to me that most people
[SPEAKER_10]: did really well with two days.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the six-day program that I developed,
the three days after the two days of
[SPEAKER_10]: abstinence involved very low doses of THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's almost abstinent, but we're just
very gradually reintroducing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not sure that that's the best
method.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the best one that I've found,
and it seems to work for most people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, any comments on starting off with a
full compliment a la the night of study
[SPEAKER_04]: after four weeks of abstinence?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any benefit to starting off with a full
compliment of receptors a la what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, after a longer abstinence break.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think some patients, they might need
longer than two days, but I doubt many
[SPEAKER_10]: would need a full month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Guillermo Moreno from the
University of California, Irvine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first described the
peripheral-restricted fine-incubator
[SPEAKER_00]: UREB937, which has been proved to be
effective in a model of migraine and also
[SPEAKER_00]: be an effective painkiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got me interested on the possibility
of activating peripheral CB1 receptors as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to both central and peripheral.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research on THC-A that Dr. Sulek has
presented got me thinking, after an
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with a patient with breast
cancer, if you believe that the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of the carboxylic acid in THC-A might
prevent it for accessing the brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be one of my hypotheses,
and then the fact that it is effective is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we were discussing with Dr.
Goldstein, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it be possible in a case of epilepsy
that a peripheral CB1 agonist will help
[SPEAKER_00]: with the seizure, but not with the central
spike, if that makes sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, able to control the motor
component of the seizure without
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling the central, if you think
something like that would be possible.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, those are some interesting ideas.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that, from my experience,
pretty clearly THC-A does penetrate the
[SPEAKER_10]: central nervous system based on some of
those studies that I presented,
[SPEAKER_10]: and I think that the peripheral activity
of THC as an antispasmodic wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_10]: potent enough to really, I mean,
it might reduce the intensity,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I doubt that it would reduce the
observable effects of the seizure
[SPEAKER_10]: altogether.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like also to add to that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure why you just want to stop the
motor activity of the seizures,
[SPEAKER_13]: because if the brain activity is still
going on, that can still continue to cause
[SPEAKER_13]: damage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were questioning whether or not we were
seeing just nonconvulsive seizures when we
[SPEAKER_08]: give THC-A.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it calming down the motor
manifestation, but possibly if we hook
[SPEAKER_08]: somebody up to an EEG, we'd still be
seeing some seizure activity and brain
[SPEAKER_08]: waves?
[SPEAKER_13]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would be an interesting question
to look at.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's one of the things I do with all
my CBD patients that I have on epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I monitor their EEGs very closely and very
frequently.
Do you have any experience with THC-A?
[SPEAKER_13]: No.
[SPEAKER_13]: In Florida, where I was practicing,
unfortunately we weren't allowed to use
[SPEAKER_13]: THC-A, so I didn't have any experience
with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if Dr. Gaitanis is still
here, but he has looked at EEGs of some of
[SPEAKER_10]: the THC-A patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the back, but it's mixed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: because the patients who've used THC to
abort seizures are alert after.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the most dramatic part,
is when they get a diazepam or valium to
create the seizures.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they get THC to abort a seizure,
they're alert, but then
[SPEAKER_03]: that's how you know the seizure's adverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's no doubt.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Pat Fry.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a private practitioner.
[SPEAKER_15]: My question is regarding patients who are
using cannabis for its anti-tumor or
[SPEAKER_15]: anti-prolific activity.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it a lifelong commitment to cannabis
therapy?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is there any, I know there's no
protocol for anything, but what is the
[SPEAKER_15]: approach for patients who are able to go
into remission?
[SPEAKER_15]: And then a second part of my question is
regarding pregnant and lactating women.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to hear the panel's thoughts on
cannabis use in that patient population.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I can answer the question on the
anti-tumor.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very good question, because it's
something that patients come in and ask
[SPEAKER_08]: is, how long am I going to have to take
this?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes the high doses of THC disrupts
your functional ability.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know if somebody, there's
anecdotal reports of people taking high
[SPEAKER_08]: dose cannabis oil for three months.
[SPEAKER_08]: They report that they're cancer free.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they go about their business,
and they're not taking high dose anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: But one presumes that they might be taking
some low dose cannabis for other symptoms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's possible that that might be
keeping them at a level of cancer freedom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of my patients who have very advanced
cancers who get good results are terrified
[SPEAKER_08]: to go off cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so many of them will reduce the dose
once they have some success, usually after
[SPEAKER_08]: six months, sometimes a year if they
achieve cancer free or in remission.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reality is that nobody really
knows how long to stay on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be very interesting to start
looking at these patients to see if can
[SPEAKER_08]: you stop right after?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it five years like they talk about
in the conventional treatment?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a few colleagues that have treated
patients with cancer, including on medical
[SPEAKER_13]: marijuana for a year or more so.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they've been taken off of it,
and the cancers have recurred.
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, we'll go with Fred Vogelstein over
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sorry, Hans.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just not going to let that go,
are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's Fred Vogelstein at Wired.
[SPEAKER_02]: For Dr. Goldstein or any of you guys,
assuming that patients are taking,
[SPEAKER_02]: say, 25 to 1 CBD oil, at what dosages can
you administer before you start to see THC
[SPEAKER_02]: effects on some of the kids?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, at 25 to 1, for example,
a 250 milligrams a day would be 10
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do patients tend to see any kind of THC
effects, or do the CBD effects tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: cancel those out?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's been your experience?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I can talk to my experience,
and then I'll let the other panelists talk
[SPEAKER_08]: to theirs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do find that children, and there is one
report in the literature that says that
[SPEAKER_08]: children may have immature cannabinoids
receptors, so they may not respond.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do find children tolerate THC much
better than adults.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of them do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not found, and you know,
people ask me, how do you know a child's
[SPEAKER_08]: not high, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And many parents can tell.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a problem in, or I should say,
seven patients contact me, not this past
[SPEAKER_08]: summer, the summer before, right around
the same time.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a product that was, parents were
sharing information on the internet about
[SPEAKER_08]: a particular 25 to 1 ratio CBD made from
ACDC, and the company had shipped out just
[SPEAKER_08]: a new batch to a handful of my patients,
and on a Friday I got a call from a mom
[SPEAKER_08]: who said, okay, this batch is different.
[SPEAKER_08]: My kid's acting weird, and I wasn't sure
what to make of it, and then the next day
[SPEAKER_08]: I got two phone calls.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just got a new batch, people who did
not know each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: My kids on the floor giggling,
and one parent says, my kid hasn't gotten
[SPEAKER_08]: out of the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, these were clear cut, and then I,
four out of the seven parents that
[SPEAKER_08]: reported this to me actually took the oil
themselves and reported that they were,
[SPEAKER_08]: that had major psychoactivity,
and so it was clear cut that these people
[SPEAKER_08]: were able to recognize psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not hear that from my families that
are using the 25 to 1, even with very high
[SPEAKER_08]: doses, two, 300.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes 450 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said, I do find that many
patients who are able to be verbal about
[SPEAKER_08]: their experience find that if you start at
a high dose, they have some difficulty,
[SPEAKER_08]: so we start at a lower dose, and we
titrate up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do that anyway, but for some families
who came to me without me starting them,
[SPEAKER_08]: they started earlier, prior to my advice,
they said, oh, we were told to start at
[SPEAKER_08]: 300 milligrams a day, and the kids kind of
wiped out from it, so there may be some
[SPEAKER_08]: tolerance issue there that you start low
and you are able to build it up over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd echo that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You always want to start low and use the
dose that's effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: With these high CBD, low THC, I like,
my rule of thumb currently is to try not
[SPEAKER_05]: to exceed a total of 15 milligrams of THC
a day after titrating one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And generally, well, particularly for
adults, it's very unlikely someone's going
[SPEAKER_05]: to get into trouble with that approach,
but even with these broad ratios,
[SPEAKER_05]: THC tends to overwhelm the effects of
everything else if given the chance,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so titration from a slow start is
really necessary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have any of you noticed a circadian rhythm
to endocannabinoid activity?
[SPEAKER_06]: Either with respect to time of day of
dosing or increased pathology in shift
[SPEAKER_06]: workers or people with different sleep
disturbances?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I couldn't relate to that,
but yeah, there's a lot of evidence to
[SPEAKER_05]: show there is a circadian rhythm to
levels, and yeah, that literature exists.
[SPEAKER_06]: Has there been any experience in time of
day of dosing is more effective?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing to keep in mind is these
don't last 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally speaking, depending on the
preparation and the mode of
[SPEAKER_05]: administration, most people are going to
need to administer cannabinoid drug two or
[SPEAKER_05]: three times a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're inhaling, it probably is a lot
more, but for chronic illnesses,
[SPEAKER_05]: there should be an emphasis on some kind
of either oral mucosal or GI
[SPEAKER_05]: administration.
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you see more pathology with
deficiencies in shift workers or anybody
[SPEAKER_06]: who's?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's worth studying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's for Dr. Silek here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The past few days have been a little bit
of a whirlwind, and the slides have gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: a little blurry already.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one slide that you had up where
you were talking about the up and down
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation of cannabinoid receptors in a
48-hour cessation from THC would then
[SPEAKER_01]: up-regulate the cannabinoid receptors
again, but then in the same slide,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was one showing that THC actually
causes the up-regulation of CB1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that dose dependent as well,
did you notice, or how does that work?
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's pretty well established
that enough THC or any CB1 agonists will
[SPEAKER_10]: down-regulate the receptors.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're internalized, and there's just a
little bit of evidence that a low dose or
[SPEAKER_10]: a single dose of THC can up-regulate the
expression of the receptors and also the
[SPEAKER_10]: affinity of the receptors.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this question is for Dr. Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you please comment on your
experience with ADHD?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, with what?
ADHD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your experience with ADHD and any ratios
that you use on your patients?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I always start with it's
personalized, so different people can have
[SPEAKER_08]: the same diagnosis and respond differently
to different ratios.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have patients using 27 to one,
25 to one, all the way down to one to one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do find that my adult patients with ADD
or ADHD, when I very first started
[SPEAKER_08]: practicing, it was mostly people who were
smoking or vaporizing THC, and they found
[SPEAKER_08]: very good results.
[SPEAKER_08]: And many of them, there's two kinds of
patients that I see, some that get
[SPEAKER_08]: enhancement of activity that we're looking
for where somebody gets Ritalin or
[SPEAKER_08]: Adderall, but without the side effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I have another subset of
population who do find good results with
[SPEAKER_08]: the stimulant medications, but they find
that some of the side effects are
[SPEAKER_08]: intolerable, including loss of appetite
and poor sleep.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're using cannabis in the evening
to counter out the effects of a medication
[SPEAKER_08]: that actually does work functionally for
them, but at nighttime they are feeling
[SPEAKER_08]: the side effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: In my pediatric population, I am starting
to see a lot of patients coming in because
[SPEAKER_08]: parents are very concerned about putting
their children on these medications.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always start with pediatric patients
with a high ratio CBD to low THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes there's other comorbidity,
epilepsy, autism sometimes exists,
[SPEAKER_08]: OCD sometimes that I'm seeing,
and I just find that I start with,
[SPEAKER_08]: I always start at the high CBD,
low THC, so like 27 to one, 25 to one,
[SPEAKER_08]: sometimes 21, depends on what the parents
can find and get.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I slowly will, depending on
results, checking in frequently every
[SPEAKER_08]: couple of weeks, maybe titrate in a little
THC to see what the effects are.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a little boy right now that I'm
taking care of that came to see me with
[SPEAKER_08]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's at the time was four.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been my patient now for two years and
he was having terrible rage with Keppra.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was impossible.
[SPEAKER_08]: They couldn't go anywhere or do anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: The family came in tears to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: We started him on CBD oil and he responded
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's interesting is that his ADHD
and autism kind of persisted.
[SPEAKER_08]: No rage anymore, but he was really kind of
a very difficult child.
[SPEAKER_08]: He couldn't be in a preschool.
[SPEAKER_08]: He wasn't really learning and had no
focus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we started very low dose THC added in
as a separate for more treatment of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it turns out he's on a one to one
ratio.
[SPEAKER_08]: He takes 50 milligrams of CBD three times
a day for seizures.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he takes 50 milligrams in the morning
of THC, which is a very large dose and is
[SPEAKER_08]: actually in a classroom that's considered
mild.
[SPEAKER_08]: And his focus, he's learning to read and
write.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as the mom says, I feel bad giving him
this, but he's not high.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he's going off to school and I'm
getting good reports and nobody knows he's
[SPEAKER_08]: on THC because she's worried about being
reported.
[SPEAKER_08]: But meanwhile, the child's having major
success.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it really does depend on
individual.
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, starting low and tiptoeing up
on dosing and just really going by how the
[SPEAKER_08]: patient responds is really the way to go
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted to add, it's not a
direct answer to the question,
[SPEAKER_10]: but because this conference has focused a
lot on CBD, especially in the treatment of
[SPEAKER_10]: children, I have found clinically that THC
is a very safe and effective medicine for
[SPEAKER_10]: children with self-injurious behavior,
violent behavior, chronic pain,
[SPEAKER_10]: with seizures, with many different
conditions.
[SPEAKER_10]: THC seems to have a better side effect
profile in children than it does with
[SPEAKER_10]: adults.
[SPEAKER_10]: And for some of these really sick kids,
it's something that should not be ignored.
[SPEAKER_10]: It might even be a first line treatment
option because of better efficacy,
[SPEAKER_10]: faster at lower doses, better cost
effectiveness than CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we've got time for one more 30
second question.
[SPEAKER_09]: To the whole panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Two questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: One about the use, the efficacy,
and bioavailability from nanoparticle
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis, full spectrum, not just CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second question is what other kind
of chemical can be used to expedite
[SPEAKER_09]: bioavailability outside of nanotechnology?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just address the second part.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we heard alluded to this morning,
cannabinoids get in best with a lipid
[SPEAKER_05]: carrier.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see a lot of preparations in
sesame oil or coconut oil or ghee is a
[SPEAKER_05]: really good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, absorption is aided by
taking with food as opposed to a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: other medicines, particularly herbal
agents.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would be the advice there.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can thank the panelists here.
[SPEAKER_14]: This has been very enlightening.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for joining us for
this session.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
