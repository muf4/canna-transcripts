[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about botanical
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about a plant,
but we haven't talked about botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take that step back and actually
talk about botanical medicine as a field,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a offering to pharmacological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from a lot of years of me
thinking this through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had some real world application
in here, but I thought it was probably
[SPEAKER_00]: more important that you got some of the
foundation before we went to real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This used to be an hour and 15 minute
lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now 45 minutes, so I'm going to be
moving fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a very abbreviated
history of botanical medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we go back at least 5,000
years to the written word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chinese, Ayurvedic, those two systems
argue over who was first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like if you look at the history
books, that Ayurvedic medicine was a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit ahead of Chinese medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that comes from an Ayurvedic
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had all kinds of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out, if you look at Ayurvedic
medicine and Chinese medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: both, they're still using compounds that
have now been turned into drugs in their
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their physicians are writing drugs from
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reserping, for instance, is something
that you may or may not use anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of drugs out there that
are really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them have turned into tools in
labs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's where it gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we really stop and think about the
number of plants in the world that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been used as drugs, it turns out that
about 80% of them match the
[SPEAKER_00]: ethnopharmacological or ethnobotanical
uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you stop and think about that,
we tend to have this idea of barefoot,
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional people as being ignorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to reframe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if 80% of the 122 plants that
we're using as drugs right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody beat us to it that didn't
understand pharmacology and chemistry in
[SPEAKER_00]: isolation, it says a lot about what we
have to learn from ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moreover, if you really look at the
developing world, it turns out that about
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of the developing world uses botanical
medicines for primary medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would say that in the US,
we're developmentally delayed in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of being aware of other options besides
big pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you also look at the drugs that
have been approved over the last 30 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 50% of those are basically based off
natural products, either directly where
[SPEAKER_00]: they have isolated it from a plant or
indirectly where they have been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesize the exact same molecule or a
very close derivative of that molecule,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was cheaper to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: In oncology, from about the 1940s to the
current date, about 175 small molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: have been approved, and about half of
those are actually natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for cancer as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this keeps cannabis out of the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about cannabis here at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about other botanical
medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the thing that really alarms
me, is that there's an estimate that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's somewhere between a quarter of a
million to half a million plants on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only about 6% of those have been
screened for biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's all well and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's not well and good is that we
lose a plant species a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially what's going on in Brazil
right now, where for some reason they've
[SPEAKER_00]: taken the control off burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're losing species, it's probably more
than a day, one a day at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody recognize that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Turmeric, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks a little bit like ginger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same family, gingerberryaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want you to take a second here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel so tied to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to move when I lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to take a second here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your eyes adjust to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're looking at is chemical space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of those graphs, natural products
that are drugs, natural products that are
[SPEAKER_00]: derived drugs, so they've been changed
slightly, natural product-inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic drugs, and then completely
synthetic drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want you to notice, just in an
overview, is look at the grouping between
[SPEAKER_00]: the first graph and the last graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see is that when we're
synthetically making drugs, we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty narrow range.
[SPEAKER_00]: When nature is biosynthesizing compounds,
phytochemicals, they're all over the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to think about that from a
couple of different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to think about that,
number one, from drug targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you look at those synthetic
drugs, about 35% to 50% of those targets
[SPEAKER_00]: for those drugs that are in the synthetics
are all targeting GPCRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, what I'm telling you is
that we have narrowed our drug therapies
[SPEAKER_00]: to what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all this stuff that we don't
know yet, these natural products that are
[SPEAKER_00]: scattered all over the chemical space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different characteristics, different
properties have the potential to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to say there's dark
pharmacology going on with medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not dark as in Darth Vader, but dark in
the sense that the drunk is looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: his keys under the light post.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's everything else where the keys
probably are, and we're still stuck in
[SPEAKER_00]: looking under the light post, because
we're just focusing on a couple different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should really get us thinking,
too, about evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolutionarily, if you stop and think it
through, what plants have really been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is derive a broad spectrum
protective effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, real world application here,
what you're looking at is cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is cannabinoids based on
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing there is that
cannabinoids have their unique space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas most of the other drugs,
again, they start to cluster, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster away from cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really are looking at unique
pharmacology here with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same photo here, in terms of actual
actions, activities here, cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to be different than the rest of the
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets very interesting very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can do that for almost any other
plant as well, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at that evolutionary
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while humans were still learning to
walk, plants had figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants couldn't pick up their roots and
run away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to figure out a way to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to figure out a way to survive
the harsh conditions of evolution at
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at humans' role in this,
so now we've gone from 300 million years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago to 5 million years ago, phytochemical
intake for paleolithic humans was about
[SPEAKER_00]: eight times, and I think this is a very
conservative estimate, about eight times
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than modern humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we're talking about a modern human
that's eating the standard American diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say it might be closer to 100 times,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the opportunity when I was working
as a professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did, you know how freshmen will
do almost anything for you, but by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time they're juniors, they're burnt out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had all the freshmen do food logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is we broke it down to the
number of plants that they had in their
[SPEAKER_00]: diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was about 10 for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it got up to 12, but about 10
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, your ancestors in the paleolithic age
ate somewhere between 80 to 220 plants a
[SPEAKER_00]: year, depending on what continent,
where they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about that difference in terms
of phytochemical intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, speaking of that, so what's happened
in terms of chronic disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really where I think it starts
to make sense because I would postulate
[SPEAKER_00]: that phytochemical deficiency is a root
cause of chronic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember all that dark pharmacology we
were just discussing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absent in people that just eat white
bread and fast food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have very different conditions,
physiological context today in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're putting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, consider that the African
hunter-gatherer's body mass index is about
[SPEAKER_00]: 19, and their serum cholesterol is about
121.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider the average American's body mass
index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, and that's gone up since this,
is about 26, and the serum cholesterol is
[SPEAKER_00]: around 294.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that physiological context has
changed dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that push towards that body
mass index and serum cholesterol is almost
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly not just that we're eating more
fat and more cholesterol, but that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: absent from us phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, think about adaptation, because
really that's what evolution is,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adapting to conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we think about that,
what it denotes, almost necessarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, in fact, necessarily, is that
structures change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Dr. Celek mentioned structure and
function, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our structure starts to change based
on what we're exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this becomes very key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so genes are modified, can be modified
by what we're eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how part of our structure changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your ancestors, what they were eating
is what you're carrying now in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the structural changes that came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we think about receptors that
are responsive to natural products,
[SPEAKER_00]: think about opioid receptors, think about
vanilloid receptors, and there's plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for each one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about nicotinic receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about dopamine receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about type 2 cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about estrogen receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about adenosine receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about GABA receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about PPAR receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, PPAR is a particular interest to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a number of years with my head
inside the nucleus, almost figuratively.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a funny image.
[SPEAKER_00]: But PPAR is particularly promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually bind two ligands at one
end at the same time in a PPAR binding
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PPAR really is almost a phytochemical
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you recall, PPAR gamma is an
important site for, and by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's part of the endocannabinoid system
now, is an important site for not just
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes, but also for inflammatory
processes and autoimmunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really do have this series of
adaptations due to what we were eating and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we were exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, even at this point,
we can still point to a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochemicals that we eat regularly,
like, for example, quercetin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quercetin, by the way, I use for my
allergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stabilizes mast cell membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also has an effect on gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So daily, we're exposed to our dietary
broth, and that turns on and turns off
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genes you're turning off and
turning on are different than the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: who's eating at McDonald's, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that becomes a very interesting
idea, right, is that our dietary broth,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, is steeped every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our genes are steeped every day by our
dietary broth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, plant-shaped humans, and one of the
really super obvious ways that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: low-hanging fruit is the cytochrome P450
system, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at at least 75 different
genes here for cytochrome P450.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cytochrome P450, you may think of it
as something that's exogenously affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, cytochrome P450 is huge in
things like breast cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: C1P1A1 versus 1B1 is going to make a
difference between those fiery 16-hydroxyl
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogens and those 2 and 4-hydroxyl
estrogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to do is keep in mind that
the interindividual variability in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytochrome P450 system is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very vast because our ancestors
developed eating different plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what region they were in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that really points at, for example,
caffeine metabolism tends to vary about
[SPEAKER_00]: 64%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know people that can drink a cup of
coffee right before bed and have a great
[SPEAKER_00]: night's sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know people that have one cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, you probably don't know that
this is the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're going to have one cup and have
a hard time sleeping that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of that that goes
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with Starbucks, young people are
going, well, I need a triple shot in my
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee of espresso.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting up to 250, up to almost 300
milligrams of coffee or caffeine per dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So huge interindividual variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also can alter metabolism,
as well as change our biological fitness,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just of ourselves, but also,
as Dr. Sulak just pointed out,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoid receptors have a role in
turning on, turning off potentially our
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the same sort of way,
all these organisms that we carry really
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to our phytochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this idea of this phytochemical index
was put out by a guy named Mark McCarty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And McCarty dropped out of medical school
and made a good career for himself as a
[SPEAKER_00]: research scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he dropped out of medical school
because he didn't think what he was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: was making sense to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason he said is we're ignoring
the idea of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ignoring the idea of the
phytochemistry that we're exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he came up with this idea of the PI,
the phytochemical index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he said was, well, let's figure
out how this alters human fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his idea, basically, is we could
use this epidemiologically to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: disease processes even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's his original paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he moved on to actually some proof of
principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, he points out very keyly
is that non-nutritive phytochemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: appear to be key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-nutritive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the vitamins and minerals that we
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those non-nutritive phytochemicals are
particularly of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, of course, is going to have a
huge effect on health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, proof of principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a number of years later, and it took a
while, but here you have something showing
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation in overweight young adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phytochemical index is inversely
related to adiposity and oxidative stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the higher the PI, the lower the
oxidative stress in the inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one on breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, what you see, those in the
fourth quartile of dietary phytochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: index, in other words, the most
phytochemical index, had a decreased risk
[SPEAKER_00]: of breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's another one on
hypertension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dietary PI was inversely associated with a
hypertension occurrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they point out synergistic
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that in a couple of
lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are phytochemicals from different
foods that are responsible for the inverse
[SPEAKER_00]: association between high dietary PI and
the risk of hypertension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get to this idea of insulin
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we see a very significant
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shouldn't surprise you,
because of what we just talked about with
[SPEAKER_00]: PPAR-gamma, again, part of the
endocannabinoid system now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But PPAR-gamma being almost a
phytochemical sensor in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so promiscuous that it binds so many
different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what would we see?
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the shot here that really makes
a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hyperlensinemia in the first quartile
versus the fourth quartile, insulin
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity, insulin resistance,
they all show beta cell dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have very significant decreases,
beneficial decreases in activity based on
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochemical index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where it starts to get
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just one chemical?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the way that we've approached
pharmacology, is we've approached it by
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, well, let's find the gem in the
jungle of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that might be the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, well, it might actually be an
additive or synergic effect that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: is having the activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to show you all these
compounds that are coming up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all anti-cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not just anti-cancer in one
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hit more than one pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of these compounds hits at least
two different pathways, at least two
[SPEAKER_00]: different pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about garlic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about legumes in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think genistein is just soy,
but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all kinds of compounds up here really
have a significant role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see this with
cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early exposure to phytochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens when we are exposed early
on in life versus not exposed early on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Waterland, by the way,
in Journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did a great series of studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They showed human epidemiological data
indicates the susceptibility to adult
[SPEAKER_00]: Lansot chronic disease is influenced by
persistent adaptations to prenatal and
[SPEAKER_00]: early postnatal nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this study came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to see more studies like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a 60-year study, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine, for those of you who
are researchers, you can imagine the
[SPEAKER_00]: funding issues around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher childhood consumption of fruit was
associated with the reduced risk of adult
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer in a study of almost 4,000 adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder how many they lost in that 60
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the kinds of studies that we
actually need.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is epidemiological evidence at its
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 years, that really gives us some
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we fight cancer, speaking of
cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, I don't see a lot of activity in
that direction, honestly, by our
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems almost criminal to me,
knowing what I know about the
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochemicals that are very preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems we really need to be thinking
more about preventing breast cancer and
[SPEAKER_00]: other cancers than treating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, treating it is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if we could prevent it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much money could we save?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then somebody wouldn't be making a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I guess I'm a little twisted today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetic component of all complex
traits such as hypertension, arthritis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cognitive function is influenced by a
broad range of effects spread across many
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs and many genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is an important point to
remember, is when we're treating chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, we're not going after one target.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what we do currently in
pharmacological approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go after one target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be exactly the wrong idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be why, if you look at the
rates of chronic disease, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the way, are going up, but you look at
the rates of visits to physicians,
[SPEAKER_00]: 75% of those visits are for chronic
diseases, which means that they keep going
[SPEAKER_00]: back because it's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really need to rethink this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if every physician had a nutritionist
in their office?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if every nutrition looked at the
phytochemical index?
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing else, and said to their
patient, you know, you really need to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: more fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what if we had to walk people?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would need to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for most people, we'd have to walk
them by the hand to show them how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't even.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a program that I was involved in
in Baltimore, inner city Baltimore,
[SPEAKER_00]: for addicts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they made it to a certain point,
they got into a halfway house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people started donating fruits
and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw out almost all the vegetables
because they didn't know what to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think this is unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the evidence?
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one, herbal medicine for cough,
the systemic review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to cruise through these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, there is evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oral herbal therapies for treating
osteoarthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there is evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbal medicine for low back pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even I was surprised by this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Cochran review on congestive heart
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is it about herbal medicine that's
actually different than pharmaceuticals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's my main take.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're treating networks with herbal
medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not treating one target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about networks for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Systems biology has been a huge
breakthrough, especially in ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's starting to affect other fields
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those other fields that it's
affecting include pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that in a second
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But network biology basically suggests
that what you want to do is massage,
[SPEAKER_00]: alter, modulate, whatever term you want to
use, multiple nodes in a network at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, you can start to
look at aggregate behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now aggregate behavior is another way of
thinking about emergent behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is emergence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Emergence is when one plus one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a simplified example that's got
some colloquial truth to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put one neuron or two neurons in a
dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put three neurons in a dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a system is created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see behavior that you won't see
with one or two neurons alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what's happening is we're
creating characteristics that we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledge when we're just studying the
properties of one compound or one cell or
[SPEAKER_00]: one receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to see networking activity
that goes well beyond what we might
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, the usual mathematical
techniques that we would use to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: drawing a straight line on a graph,
which unfortunately I've done a lot of in
[SPEAKER_00]: my life, can't really explain this
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it tends to get ignored and tends
to get missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that outlier on the graph?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to go after.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened there?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we tend to throw it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's a real living cellular network.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is put out by a company that does
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's happening inside a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what starts to happen,
and this is molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the field, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is what you're looking at is signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at crosstalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much as physics shifted from the particle
back in the 60s and 70s to the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between the particles,
that's what needs to be happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is we need to be looking at the
relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cut out the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it in a box and we study it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut out the kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it in a box and we study it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We study its weight, its properties,
its volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how are we understanding the signaling
that's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a huge piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spend some time there, but we don't
spend enough time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a very simplified model of immune
network that certainly would be affected
[SPEAKER_00]: by many different compounds, whether
pharmacologically synthetic or
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we really need to start doing is
thinking in systems and not just thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about one target, thinking broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you really look at how we've
managed unresponsive patients in our
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical practices, a lot of times what
we've done is combinations of drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: because we start to think more in systems,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're, in my opinion, if we're thinking
in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the saying, somebody once said
that a dirty drug is a drug that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what is meant by a dirty drug in
pharma?
[SPEAKER_00]: A dirty drug is a target that hits more
than one, a drug that hits more than one
[SPEAKER_00]: target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so think about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about the name that we've given
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something we want, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, if we go back to evolution
and the way that we were eating and the
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochemicals that we were exposed to,
that's exactly what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hitting more than one target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about it from the plant's
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do a Paulinesque, a Michael
Paulinesque model of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would the plant say to itself,
well, if I'm going to produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm going to spend all that ATP making
a compound, it better be useful in more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one place, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how plants evolved to survive 300
million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, Gleevec is a great example
of a blockbuster drug that was designed to
[SPEAKER_00]: only hit one target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they started looking at why it
was so efficacious, they discovered that
[SPEAKER_00]: it was actually hitting multiple targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking in system really means that we
need to rethink how we go about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: rethink how we evaluate and how we think
one disease, one drug is the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really came from Pasteur in
Ehrlich.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to move past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk specifically about network
pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this field is probably about 10 to 15
years old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dustin and I are the only ones that I
know at this point talking about network
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacology with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it actually makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just have a comment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occam's razor was theology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what the idea of Occam's razor
is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a simplified explanation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The simplest explanation is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's used in labs all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually used in clinics all over
the world as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Occam, the man Occam, he was a theologian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are we taking scientific advice from a
theologian?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll let you decide if that's a good
or bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is network pharmacology?
[SPEAKER_00]: The recognition informed by systems
biology that drugs for many disease states
[SPEAKER_00]: may require multiple activities to be
efficacious, acting on the network of
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues, cells, receptors, enzymes,
and the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's take an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's look at asthma targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all the targets that are
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is under the light post,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That we know of for asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's all the drugs that we know
of that can actually treat these
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a number of drugs we can
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'd like to do is turn this on
its head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take the common food grape,
Vitus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's look at all the compounds that
are anti allergic, anti asthmatic,
[SPEAKER_00]: asthmatic, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're anti bronchotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're anti leukotriene and anti
pharyngeogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anti prostaglandins, anti spasmodics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do plants make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so could, and by the way, I don't
think if I was going to treat asthma as a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinician with herbal medicines,
I wouldn't use grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked a really simple food to highlight
this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a minimum of what activity you
might have versus an herb that was used to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does the patient that comes in with
asthma who's eating fast food respond
[SPEAKER_00]: differently than the patient that's come
in that's eating a diet high in fruits and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, has a high phytochemical
index?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to suggest to you that
they're going to respond very differently
[SPEAKER_00]: to your approach, your pharmacological
approach, based on what they're eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either going to be enhancing that
effect or just really trying to push hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to get an effect when there's not much
other activity supporting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a phytochemical foundation to
support the pharmacology that you might
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So network pharmacology, basically we're
looking at multiple targets versus single
[SPEAKER_00]: targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compared to that, multiple but partial
perturbations, and I like this term,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple but partial perturbations of
selected genes in a network are almost
[SPEAKER_00]: always more efficient than the knockout of
a single well selected target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think that through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what you've got here is a nudge
versus a sledgehammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go in with one drug for one
target, we're hitting it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: sledgehammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go in with a bunch of broad
spectrum phytochemicals, we're massaging
[SPEAKER_00]: the system, we're nudging the system so
that it's not 100%, it's not even 80%
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibition for an enzyme, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be more like 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we hit a bunch of enzymes in that
system at 20% inhibition, we actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: an effect that turns out to be safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's robust, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the issue here, is redundant
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robust living molecular networks have
redundant pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we try to knock out one
pathway with a single target drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're almost always going to lose efficacy
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at this, it really does
look like what we have been doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: food plants forever in terms of our diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think of it as ensemble properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of it like music.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we put one compound in,
what does that sound like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we put multiple compounds in
that have grown together in a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there some sort of chemical harmony
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this study came out and it made a lot
of noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came out in, I think it was 2003,
a strategy to reduce cardiovascular
[SPEAKER_00]: disease by more than 80% published in
British Medical Journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what they suggested was that
a multi-component remedy, a poly-pill they
[SPEAKER_00]: called it, based on a single daily pill
containing six components, those
[SPEAKER_00]: components were a statin three blood
pressures, lowering drugs at half the
[SPEAKER_00]: dose, again, partial nudges, partial
inhibition, folic acid, and aspirin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was their conclusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this was all theoretical, but their
conclusion was it would prevent 88% of
[SPEAKER_00]: heart attacks and 80% of strokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that got everybody's attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there were a couple of papers
that came out after this that made fun of
[SPEAKER_00]: this multi-component remedy because it got
everybody's attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how would it really affect our
epidemiology?
[SPEAKER_00]: About one in three people would directly
benefit, each on average gaining 11 to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: years of life without a heart attack or
stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty darn profound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what would happen in terms of the
United States alone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of our cardiovascular disease deaths
in the United States would be prevented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty profound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, hey, eating more fruit and
vegetables and whole grains actually might
[SPEAKER_00]: make real sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, getting less salt and
trans fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's the proof of principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody just did this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did they find?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those on the poly-pill had a third fewer
cardiac events over five years in the
[SPEAKER_00]: control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the poly-pill group with high
adherence, greater than 70% adherence,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in the risk of major
cardiovascular events was 57% fewer
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiac events than control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't get the promised 80%,
but we got almost 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really notable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take the poly-pill from a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all your cholesterol lowering
agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your blood pressure lowering
agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your anti-inflammatory agents,
which by the way, of course, would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea with cardiovascular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your anti-aggregants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 40% of drug targets that map with
disease genes map to more than one
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really when it comes down to it,
and again, I look at it from the molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, there's a common theme going on
in the molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet we name them differently and we
treat them differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start thinking on a molecular
biology level, we really start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that, gosh, a lot of these diseases have a
common thread and we can treat that common
[SPEAKER_00]: thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might depend on the weak link.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might depend on the SNPs that you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might depend on the family inheritance
that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might depend on the diet that you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physiological context is all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a drug discovery approach that matches
with a systems biology approach is really
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna give us combinations of small
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to see that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing ACE inhibitors with statins
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the drug cocktails for
tuberculosis, resistant tuberculosis or
[SPEAKER_00]: cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so intervening in a network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacological strategies with multiple
targets might have a better chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting the complex equilibrium of whole
cellular networks than drugs and an
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced safety profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's, this looks like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have the old, I don't think this is
the abbreviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, here we go, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I go back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so differences as compared to
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pulled the case studies here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize, that slide is slightly in
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what I wanna leave you off with
here, is there's differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those differences,
I've put it categorized into two broad
[SPEAKER_00]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pharmacodynamic differences and
there's pharmacokinetic differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pharmacodynamic differences,
there's multiple modes of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, biochemical convergence on
a single outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also multiple constituents
that can work on one topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can end up with molecular
multitasking on one hand, and target
[SPEAKER_00]: getting hit by multiple molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: In pharmacokinetically, we affect things
like absorption, distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism, excretion, and toxicology.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what you're gonna see,
and if you think about this again
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionarily, is that plants really have
this role in affecting the accessory
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds in plants, not the actives,
really have a role in affecting
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacokinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may improve bioavailability,
we may delay metabolism of the actives,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is really super common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that 50% of all drugs on
the way to the market fail because of poor
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacokinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something we should consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we just, because we're a little
behind schedule anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna call it quits and we'll,
I think we have a break now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, break time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks.
Thank you.
