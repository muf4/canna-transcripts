[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be in California after
a short trip of about 20 hours from
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerusalem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll try in my talk if I know how to
advance my slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can show me how to advance my
slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to present an overview of things
that are happening in the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, for my group, it has been quite a
few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, as one mentioned
before, we started work in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: 1960s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that many of you were not born
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started work, there was absolutely
no interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, when I asked for a
grant from NIH and NIH had a lot of money
[SPEAKER_01]: at that time and gave a lot of grants,
they told me, and I knew the people there,
[SPEAKER_01]: many of them outstanding scientists,
when you have something more relevant to
[SPEAKER_01]: the US, contact us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody smokes marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that's being used in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a year later or two years later,
their pharmacologist came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked him what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody important, maybe a senator,
had approached him and had asked whether
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana destroys the mind, the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, his son had been seen smoking
pot and he wanted to know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, things have changed since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature, probably one of the most important
scientific journals, Nature published last
[SPEAKER_01]: year four reviews, and this is our review
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the brain and the cannabis and
all the time we have additional
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is, in the medical
side at least, that it is known today that
[SPEAKER_01]: modulating endocannabinoid activity may
have therapeutic potential in almost all
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases affecting humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was published, this was in a
review by two scientists at NIH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I'm not sure that this is
absolutely true, affecting all diseases,
[SPEAKER_01]: affecting humans, there is no doubt that
quite a lot of diseases are affected,
[SPEAKER_01]: and therefore there is a lot of interest,
contrary to what happened, as I told you a
[SPEAKER_01]: few years before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's go back and look at some of the
interest in cannabis in my area of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, in the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was used for thousands of years,
and this is something that the Syrians
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had three types, so they used it
in three ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used it as a recreational drug,
if you wish, in modern terms, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: called that ganzigunu.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used it apparently for neurological
diseases, and they called that hazalo,
[SPEAKER_01]: and apparently it was also part of their
religion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this went on and on for quite a lot of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something from Dr. Reynolds,
who was the personal physician of Queen
[SPEAKER_01]: Victoria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Queen Victoria had severe migraines,
and he used to bring cannabis from India.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently European cannabis was not good
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to bring cannabis from India for
migraines, and he didn't mention her name
[SPEAKER_01]: in her articles, but it was well known
that this is what he was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we speak today of cannabis,
most people will think of the plant alone,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the compounds that are found in the
plant, and I'll, of course, speak about
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is not so simple, and things have
developed quite rapidly over the last 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can see three phases of cannabinoid
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them has to do with the plant,
the fight of cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one has to do with the
endogenous cannabinoids that we and all
[SPEAKER_01]: mammalians produce, anandamide and 2AG,
two compounds that we discovered in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, there has been a lot of
interest, at least amongst many
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists, of compounds that we produce,
mammalians produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are about 100 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are like anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anandamide is a relatively simple
compound, a fatty acid bound to an amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acid or an amino acid derivative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are about 100 compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of these, at least those that
have been investigated, are of major
[SPEAKER_01]: importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't believe that the body makes
compounds because it has nothing else to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have about 100 compounds,
and these are being investigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll spend a part of my talk on these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with the fight of
cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised to find out in the early
60s when I started work that contrary to
[SPEAKER_01]: morphine, which had been isolated 100
years previously from opium, and contrary
[SPEAKER_01]: to cocaine, the cannabinoid chemistry was
not well known, although some excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: chemists had worked on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is because it turned out that
there is a huge number of cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the techniques were probably not
available in the 30s and 40s to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, without any major administrative
problems, got five kilograms of hashish,
[SPEAKER_01]: Lebanese hashish, from the police.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started looking at the cannabinoids
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incidentally, the hashish I got was
smuggled hashish, which Lebanese and
[SPEAKER_01]: Israelis collaborate to get through the
frontier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But only part of it is being caught,
and that came to my lab ultimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started isolating the materials
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to isolate about a dozen
compounds, most of them unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of them, for those of you who
remember your high school chemistry,
[SPEAKER_01]: the right-hand side of the molecule is
more or less the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we know there are some differences,
but at that time, we found out that all
[SPEAKER_01]: the compounds we identified had the
right-hand side, the aromatic part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule, if you wish, the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the differences were only in the
left-hand side of the molecule,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these modifications led to a huge
number of compounds, and they are
[SPEAKER_01]: identified, at least some of them
identified here, cannabigerol,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabino, THC, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the two most important compounds were
CBD, cannabidiol, and THC, which we
[SPEAKER_01]: elucidated the structure of cannabidiol,
which had been isolated way back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 30s, but the structure was unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we published that in 1963.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our first paper on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And THC, we were able, I believe,
for the first time, to isolate in a pure
[SPEAKER_01]: form and to elucidate its structure and
its absolute configuration, the way it
[SPEAKER_01]: stays in space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these two compounds are the two
compounds that have been investigated most
[SPEAKER_01]: thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is still quite a lot of work on
some of the additional compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know enough about cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know enough about
cannabichromine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly know almost nothing about
cannabicyclole and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is worth doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the other compounds, to the best
of my knowledge, except THC, do not bind
[SPEAKER_01]: to the cannabinoid receptors, and I have a
few words to say about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with cannabis, everything is
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We turned out that THC, CBD, all the other
compounds are not actually natural
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are secondary products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are made in the plant from their
acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant produces CBD acid, THC acid,
cannabigerol acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: These compounds are not stable,
and they convert on the plant itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: or later, they convert into their neutral
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabidiol acid converts into
cannabidiol, and THC acid converts into
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there isn't much work on the acids
because they are not stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And scientists don't like to work with
unstable compounds because one doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know whether the results are due to the
starting material, to the acid itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this case, or to those compounds that
are developed in the derivatives of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is not enough work on the
cannabinoid acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought over the last few years that
it's worthwhile to stabilize the acids and
[SPEAKER_01]: then maybe look at their activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, as I mentioned over the last
few years, we have been working
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly on cannabidiolic acid,
which we stabilize by converting it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the methyl ester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this compound is stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this compound, apparently,
to a certain extent parallels the activity
[SPEAKER_01]: of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, it's more active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have already published several
papers on the activity of this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are going to hear a few lectures on
this compound, as work in this field is
[SPEAKER_01]: being supported by one of the two groups
that's organizing this meeting,
[SPEAKER_01]: EPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that after we know more
about CBD acid methyl ester, it will,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope, hopefully become a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we know about the cannabidiolic
acid methyl ester?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we found and published that it
suppresses nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, cancer chemotherapy does
cause nausea and sometimes most,
[SPEAKER_01]: most unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It suppresses nausea and it suppresses
anxiety in rats.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know whether it suppresses
anxiety in humans because it has never
[SPEAKER_01]: been given to a human, never administered
to a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are neither rats nor mice,
so we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this particular compound was found
that it enhances serotonin activation,
[SPEAKER_01]: as all of you know, serotonin,
dopamine.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the two major neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're of utmost importance in a large
number of diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is probably one of the mechanisms
that the acids and the neutral compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: act.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in any case, this compound,
580, the methyl ester was found to lower
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite recently, we also found that it
lowers, again, in animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lowers depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we are not, we can never say 100%
sure whether depression in animals
[SPEAKER_01]: parallels depression in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that this is so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to see whether the
methyl ester will suppress anxiety and
[SPEAKER_01]: depression in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that the next meeting here,
the next few meetings here, we'll hear a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot about these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I go into some detail,
I want to say a few words about an effect
[SPEAKER_01]: which we observed quite a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called it an entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that compounds that are
present in cannabis and do not have any
[SPEAKER_01]: significant cannabinoid activity by
themselves affect the activity of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They affect the activity of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: They affect the activity of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We published that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of papers that refer to
the entourage saying that patients prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: to use a cannabis extract rather than pure
THC or pure CBD because of the entourage
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This may or may not be fully correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is surprisingly very little work
on the entourage effect by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a huge number of terpies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have other compounds in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still do not know how these
compounds or which are these compounds in
[SPEAKER_01]: the long list of terpinoids and flavonoids
that cause the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope, again, that more work will be
done on the entourage effect because it is
[SPEAKER_01]: an important observation, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does not really answer all the
questions we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is of major value.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is of biological importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me say a few words about the
effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been published.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are well-known.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will not spend much time on THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a few of the major effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it affects pain, nausea and
vomiting, sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of patients report that sleep,
allowing them to go to sleep, is the major
[SPEAKER_01]: effect that they can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it lowers appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, as we all know, at low doses,
it may cause these effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we go to higher doses, especially
people that have not used cannabis THC
[SPEAKER_01]: previously, if they use initially high
doses, many of the mostly young people end
[SPEAKER_01]: up in the psychiatry department with an
attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, I have found out that in the
hospital I'm associated with, the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: faculty of the Hebrew University,
the psychiatrists are strongly opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is that they see,
almost every day, one or two young people
[SPEAKER_01]: being brought to the hospital with an
attack because they started using
[SPEAKER_01]: initially large amounts of cannabis,
large amounts of THC, which, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: can cause a psychiatric attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most recently, we have seen that THC,
again, at low doses can cause,
[SPEAKER_01]: can lower depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, many patients say so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we have a biphasic effect here.
[SPEAKER_01]: At low doses, we definitely see
antidepressive effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at higher doses, we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: At higher doses, we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other cannabinoids do the same,
but it seems that they do that at much
[SPEAKER_01]: higher doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some years ago, we looked at the
possibility that THC is effective in
[SPEAKER_01]: post-trauma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, a lot of post-trauma patients
use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to know whether this is true
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did a small clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that, yes, most definitely,
it affects most of the symptoms of
[SPEAKER_01]: post-trauma in patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had patients that some of them were
soldiers previously and had seen people
[SPEAKER_01]: around them get hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a few women that had been
raped.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a few people that had been in
traffic accidents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had patients of all types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, most definitely, it helped with
the post-trauma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that there will be a much
larger trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of patients, as you know,
a lot of post-trauma patients use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really have to know more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have enough clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I want to stress we badly need
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one thing that physicians
insist on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rightly so.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can base their work on clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have clinical trials for most
of the diseases that are well known to be
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not seen yet a major clinical trial
in a cancer, any cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that some cancer affected
more, some cancer affected less.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I strongly ask the clinicians,
here, please try to go ahead with modern
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials in most of the diseases
that we're speaking about, certainly in
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what about CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course, CBD is well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised to see that people think
that CBD will be used to the extent of $25
[SPEAKER_01]: billion a year within the next few years
in the US alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be an exaggeration, after all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll say a few words about the effects
of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, and many others, have seen in animals
that CBD, pure CBD, affects epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did a clinical trial, as you can
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We published it in 1980, almost 40 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was done in collaboration with my
colleagues in Sao Paulo in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we supplied them with almost 500 grams
of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had isolated from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they gave relatively high doses,
200 milligrams a day, to epileptic
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing else was helping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found that, yes, indeed,
it is most definitely a very helpful drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was done on a small number of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even so, that should have meant at
that time that, yes, here we have a drug
[SPEAKER_01]: that can help with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what happened was nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for nearly 30 years, nobody used
cannabidiol in epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the US, parents saw that cannabis,
the plant, cannabis that contains the high
[SPEAKER_01]: doses of CBD is indeed helpful,
especially in children that had epileptic
[SPEAKER_01]: attacks, sometimes 20 to 30 epileptic
attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the only thing that helped them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they started going to one of the states
that cannabis was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a lot of public pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the US Food and Drug Administration
ultimately approved a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until then, I don't believe that there was
any major clinical trial with cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as we know, the trial was a
relatively large trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, CBD, in the name of Epidiolex,
is being used as an anti-epileptic drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we have to wait 30 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have helped children,
in particular children, over these 30
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having 20 to 30 epileptic attacks a day
really means that the child of this time
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ruined a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have helped maybe thousands of
children.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm under the impression that this is
what's happening with quite a few of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one field, we have pretty good
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the graft-versus-host disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: We and others had found that cannabidiol
works in autoimmune diseases, namely
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases in which the body attacks itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why it does that, quite a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the ultimate fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: The body attacks itself in many autoimmune
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been told that there are about 80 of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 10 are pretty well-known and
serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a colleague of mine, Dr. Yeshurun,
thought that maybe he should try
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiol in something that is closely
related to autoimmune disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: namely certain cancer cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a bone marrow transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the body doesn't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the transplant doesn't like the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they attack each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the patient is sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sometimes very sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is kind of an autoimmune disease,
then maybe cannabidiol will be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, he tried pretty high doses,
about 300 milligrams a day, of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave it to these patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, he helped most of the
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are the results that he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had about 100 controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 46% of these had a mild attack,
a relatively mild attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 10% have had a very serious attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those that got CBD, only 12% had
unpleasant symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of those, I mean, the serious
patients, which previously were 10%,
[SPEAKER_01]: went down to 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, cannabidiol in GVHD is,
I think, a third phase investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sincerely hope that it will become a
drug within the next few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I hope that it will be possible
to help quite a lot of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third example I want to give is
schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had done a small trial of CBD,
high doses in schizophrenia, in Brazil,
[SPEAKER_01]: many years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was quite successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was not taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just an interesting paper in
the literature of an atom also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Germany, Dr. Levica did a major
clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he found that, indeed, CBD was an
extremely, was a very good
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-schizophrenia drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: He compared it to another drug that was
being widely used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both drugs were active.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the activity of the drug that's
presently being used had a lot of side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, as we know, does not cause side
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: That apparently helps a lot with
schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he saw, and this seems to be the
mechanism, CBD enhances anandamide levels
[SPEAKER_01]: in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe this is the way it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have additional information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, although the paper was published
seven years ago, it is still not being
[SPEAKER_01]: used in schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, are we missing something?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have enough data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, psychiatrists will not be
using CBD in schizophrenia without
[SPEAKER_01]: additional data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may be losing something important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, please, those of you, if there are
any psychiatrists here, try to repeat and
[SPEAKER_01]: try to enhance the work that was published
by Levica and then by others later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Levica found that when cannabidiol
was compared to the drug that was used
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bit, amiculpride, it caused less
weight gain, which amiculpride causes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no changes in hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a few extrapyramidal
syndromes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that there were less muscle
spasms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was less slowness of movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was less tremor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were less irregular jerky
movements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm trying to say, here we have a
drug which possibly, quite possibly,
[SPEAKER_01]: acts well on schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are speaking about 1% of the
population which has schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a large part of this population does
not work, cannot work, cannot study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, to a certain extent, lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can help, I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to mention, speaking of the
cannabinoids and the plant cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, another autoimmune disease,
diabetes type 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a good model in animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to see whether cannabidiol helps
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the diabetes type 1, the body
destroys the cells that produce insulin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, those mice that were now
treated with CBD after a certain period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time lost most of the cells that produce
insulin, while those that were CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: treated, 77% of the cells remained intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: We badly need new diabetes type 1 drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has never been tested in the
clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, schizophrenia, at least we have one
or two clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: With diabetes type 1, we don't have a
single one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we speak of the mechanisms of CBD,
here we have a major problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to bind to a lot of receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has all kinds of mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, I prefer this mechanism,
which was published recently, that CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: causes an increase in certain cells that
are called MDSC cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these cells are known to suppress
another type of cells that cause
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called CD4T cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether this is correct or not,
whether this is the only mechanism,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems to me to make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabidiol seems to cause lowering of the
activity of the CD4T cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to wait over the next few years
to find out whether this is true or true,
[SPEAKER_01]: in all cases, only in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, many of the drugs that we have on the
market are not natural products,
[SPEAKER_01]: natural products as they appear.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot buy penicillin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The penicillin is not a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Derivatives of penicillin are drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same is true for cortisone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot buy the hormone cortisone in a
drug store.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy prednisone or derivatives of
cortisone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that this may happen to a
certain extent with cannabidiol and
[SPEAKER_01]: related compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, if we take cannabidiol and
make a small change, put a fluorine atom
[SPEAKER_01]: on the cannabidiol, it is more active than
cannabidiol itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned before, the acids,
the methyl esters of the acids do the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And chances are that we shall have within
the next 10, 15 years on the market both
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, the plant materials,
and derivatives like the fluorine
[SPEAKER_01]: compound, the methyl esters and so on,
which is not a bad situation because
[SPEAKER_01]: patients will be able to choose whatever
they want and they believe is best for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, up till now I talked about the plant
phase of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started to change when the mechanism
was, there was research on the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 80s, namely almost 20 years after
the cannabinoids were identified,
[SPEAKER_01]: an American group, Alan Howlett,
discovered that there is a receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this receptor, which is a specific
one, is found in those areas of the brain
[SPEAKER_01]: that are quite typical for cannabinoid for
THC effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those areas of the brain that have to do
with movement control, with coordination,
[SPEAKER_01]: learning and memory, a cognitive function,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we had an opening to the mechanism
by having a receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we know that we have two
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But receptors don't exist in the body
because there is a plant out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise we'll have millions of
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Receptors exist because we produce
compounds that bind, that stimulate or
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibit these receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went ahead looking for the
compounds, the natural compounds that do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does one do something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for those of you that are interested
in the chemical part, we take THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, put on a tritium atom on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the compound is still very active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we bind this tritium labeled THC
to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then start to look at the areas of the
brain that also want to bind to the
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing so, they kick out the labeled
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can measure the labeled material
that has been kicked out from its binding
[SPEAKER_01]: to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by this simple method, a way of doing
it, it takes only three, four years and a
[SPEAKER_01]: few PhD students and quite a lot of
photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to identify two compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them we call the nanomide and the
other one 2AG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these compounds are essentially the
cannabinoids of our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are chemically completely different
than THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their activity is essentially the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC mimics the activity of the compounds
that we make, the compounds nanomide and
[SPEAKER_01]: 2AG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are, of course, some
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: These compounds are made in the body when
and where needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly, a nanomide is not present in
life in large amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the body, it's present in very small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is synthesized by the body when and
where needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts, and then the body breaks it down
essentially immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't see the effects that are so
well known with THC, as THC stays in the
[SPEAKER_01]: body for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have two neurotransmitters and
novel neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will, of course, not go into the
biochemistry, but contrary to most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other neurotransmitters, they,
as I said, are not present in the body in
[SPEAKER_01]: large amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are present in the nerve.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nerve is not just a wire going from my
hand to my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are breaks in the middle so the body
can regulate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are called synapses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nanomide and 2AG are formed in the
post-synapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the part of the brain that's after
a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go out from the post-synapse to
the pre-synapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They activate the receptor, and then they
affect the formation or the release of
[SPEAKER_01]: other neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm saying in short is that these
compounds, and THC also, act not only by
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also act by regulating other
neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the reasons why we see
so many effects by both THC and the
[SPEAKER_01]: endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the endogenous cannabinoids,
nanomide and 2AG, are very, very important
[SPEAKER_01]: and interesting compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, because of all kinds of legal
problems, they have never been
[SPEAKER_01]: administered to a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's quite frankly outrageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: When insulin was discovered almost 100
years ago, it was given to humans within a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of months and became a drug within
a year or so, an excellent drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insulin, derivatives of insulin,
are being used 100 years after discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nanomide and 2AG, which were discovered in
the mid-90s by our group, have never been
[SPEAKER_01]: given to a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although they are not toxic, they do not
cause any major side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the legal situation,
nobody has given them to a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no solution to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I mentioned that we have two
receptors, CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Activation of the CB1 causes the
well-known cannabis effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The activation of CB2 is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It leads to, essentially, to protective
actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of a receptor that parallels
the immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps in a large number of disease
states, and I'll say a few words later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the endocannabinoid system contains
nanomide and 2AG.
[SPEAKER_01]: The enzymes that synthesize these
compounds, the enzymes that break down
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds, and quite a few companies
are working on these enzymes because they
[SPEAKER_01]: can enhance the presence of nanomide,
let's say, by blocking the enzymes that
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy these compounds, that metabolize
these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I expect that a few new drugs will be
available in the market within the next
[SPEAKER_01]: five, 10 years because these compounds can
affect the levels of nanomide and the
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of 2AG by playing around with the
enzymes that synthesize them or the
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes that break them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not directly, not giving nanomide
directly, not giving even a derivative
[SPEAKER_01]: nanomide directly, but by playing around
with their being built up or destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a lot of scientists have looked into
the activity of nanomide and 2AG.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are about 6,000 publications that
have to do with nanomide and 2AG,
[SPEAKER_01]: and today we have quite a big list of
compounds of physiological state that are
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by nanomide and 2AG, and here is
an alphabetical list starting with anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: and blood pressure and immune system,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had a full list, it will take another
two, three slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have a system of major,
major importance, and I have no doubt that
[SPEAKER_01]: within the next few years we shall see
many more papers in addition to the about
[SPEAKER_01]: 6,000 papers that have been published.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see many more papers, and this will
open to us or clear to us many of the
[SPEAKER_01]: physiological problems that we know exist,
but we have not been able to show,
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand how they happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I will give just one example of work
that I did with one of my colleagues,
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Shohami.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a specialist in brain trauma,
and we wanted to know what happens with
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoid system in brain
trauma, so she caused brain trauma mice,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we found that the 2AG in the brain
goes up tremendously.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 2AG is the red thing that you see in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see and compare it to the controls,
you'll see that there is enhancement,
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very potent enhancement of 2AG
levels in the brain after brain trauma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that because we have caused brain
trauma and brain damage and the brain
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't know what it does, or is it a
reaction of the brain, kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: protective reaction, if you wish,
so we synthesized a large amount of 2AG
[SPEAKER_01]: and gave them to mice that had undergone
brain trauma and compared them to mice
[SPEAKER_01]: that had not undergone brain trauma,
and we found that the 2AG lowers by 50%
[SPEAKER_01]: the infarct volume in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The infarct was not a very strong one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It caused a certain amount of damage,
but it could be compared, so we saw that
[SPEAKER_01]: most definitely the brain reacts to the
damage by producing 2AG and lowering the
[SPEAKER_01]: damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we see quite a lot of people with
brain damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe, 2AG is a good protective
compound protective drug, if you wish,
[SPEAKER_01]: but again, nothing has been done in this
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I mentioned to Dr. Shohami,
whom I collaborate, I still collaborate in
[SPEAKER_01]: many areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the field of cannabis, whether it's the
plant cannabinoids or the endogenous
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, there should be a lot of
joint work, a lot of collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no way we can understand what's
going on by looking just at the chemistry,
[SPEAKER_01]: or looking just at the pharmacology,
or looking just at the physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be in collaboration,
and our group has collaborated with a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: number of the colleagues all over the
world, and I mentioned that in more detail
[SPEAKER_01]: around the end of my lecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here is what I said at 2AG in
addition to blocking the brain trauma or
[SPEAKER_01]: at least relieving some of the damage that
was caused was found to be decreased in
[SPEAKER_01]: major depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, is it possible that at least in some
patients, major depression is caused by
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that the body has levels that are
too low, the levels of 2AG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we have seen something of that sort
between anandamide and anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this was work that was published by
Hill some time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, here we have an opening that most
definitely needs further development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, there are two receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CB1 receptor causes, in addition to
many other things, the well-known effects
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis, changes in mood and changes
in activity and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CB2 doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBT is exclusively a neuroprotective
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least 90% of its actions are
protective, and one can see that because
[SPEAKER_01]: there are papers showing that CBT
receptors work in myocardial infarction,
[SPEAKER_01]: in atherosclerosis, in stroke,
in fibrosis, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there are a few companies working
on synthetic CB2 agonists, and I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: that we shall see synthetic CB2 agonists
as drugs against at least some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is possible to do that because we
have, and other groups have done the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is possible to synthesize compounds
that act only on the CB2 under protective
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't act on the CB1, so it doesn't
matter whether somebody gets very high
[SPEAKER_01]: doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: One does not see the cannabis anabinoid
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: One sees only the effects on the CB2,
and it is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anandamide, 2-AG-DHC act both on CB1 and
CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible, again, as I said before,
to synthesize compounds, and here are two
[SPEAKER_01]: examples of compounds that act only in the
CB2, and chances are that we shall see the
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds of this type in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to come to the last part of my
lecture, and it has to do with the
[SPEAKER_01]: activity of anandamide-like compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, anandamide is a simple
compound, relatively simple compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is formed from a fatty acid,
which is bound to an amino acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: and our body has about 20 fatty acids
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has about 20 amino acids, and so the
body, using already the synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism it knows, our body is lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it can use something that it knows how
to use, it will use it as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, the body has learned how
to make anandamide, and by the same
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic mechanism it can make many other
compounds, fatty acids bound to amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids, and it has made about 100 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll speak about the three or four that
have been investigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's start again from brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brain injury acts, I've been told,
in two directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Causing the effects on compounds present
in the body, called glutamate and
[SPEAKER_01]: cytokines and so on, and they can bring to
self-death, and this is what we see in
[SPEAKER_01]: most cases in brain injury, but there is
also something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: In brain injury, one sees
vasoconstrictions, the blood vessels
[SPEAKER_01]: constrict, and this is not healthy,
and so the body tries to prevent,
[SPEAKER_01]: or to lower, vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we compared the vasoconstriction with a
THC, CBD, or anandamide, a lower
[SPEAKER_01]: vasoconstriction, and we saw that the
brain extract does that better than these
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the answer was, do we have compounds
that the brain makes and that they block,
[SPEAKER_01]: or try to block, or vasoconstriction,
they are vasodilators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a PhD student who worked very
hard on that, and after a few years,
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to identify a compound which is
very close chemically to anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the anandamide on the top,
on the left-hand side, and we isolated the
[SPEAKER_01]: compound, which is essentially the same,
but it has another oxal group there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not bind to the receptor,
but it is vasodilator, a pretty potent
[SPEAKER_01]: vasodilator, and this is what our body
does when there is vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It synthesizes this compound which is
closely related to anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said to ourselves, well,
maybe there are additional anandamide-like
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the third phase, the phase
which quite a few people in the field
[SPEAKER_01]: work, the three phases I mentioned at the
plant, chemistry and the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, the compounds that we make,
anandamide and 2AG, and now I'm speaking
[SPEAKER_01]: of anandamide-like compounds, and this was
the first case when we discovered that
[SPEAKER_01]: rachidonil serine has something to do with
vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing some research in Professor
Bap's lab on bone remodeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had nothing to do, at least we thought
it has nothing to do with bones,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we shall hear quite a bit on that by a
colleague of ours who will be talking this
[SPEAKER_01]: afternoon, and we found that the body
makes, again, a compound which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, anandamide-like compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a fatty acid, in this case,
oleic acid, found in olive oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it is bound to an amino acid called
serine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all this came from a work that was
published many years ago showing that
[SPEAKER_01]: osteoporosis is less prevalent in the
Middle East or in the countries around the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mediterranean than in Norway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, that's what they suggested,
maybe because women in the Mediterranean
[SPEAKER_01]: region have, they consume olive oil,
and indeed, after the age of 55 and so on,
[SPEAKER_01]: with all the hormonal changes,
the body does something which prevents the
[SPEAKER_01]: osteoporosis, which otherwise will be seen
in essentially all women at that age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we tried olive oil, and we tried
oleic acid, they didn't work, but then we
[SPEAKER_01]: tried derivatives of oleic acid,
and we then looked for these compounds in
[SPEAKER_01]: the body, and we found again, as I said,
a fatty acid bound to an amino acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very potent compound that works
against bone destruction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is company that thinks that it can
do something with it and developing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: so here we have a compound which may prove
to be of major interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed, if we take animals and cause
osteoporosis, and I wouldn't go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: details, you can see the red, the bone is
being destroyed, the green is before the
[SPEAKER_01]: destruction of the bone, the red is after
the bone has started to be destructed
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the hormonal changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we give these animals the compound,
synthetic in this case, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: the compound that our body makes,
the bone starts growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this may be of importance because
most of the drugs that are available today
[SPEAKER_01]: for that kind of disease stop the
destruction, but they do not, in most
[SPEAKER_01]: cases, help with the new formation of
bone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we have a compound that maybe,
also in humans, never tested in humans,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only stops the disease, but also
causes the bone to be built again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to end with something that we
are doing at the moment, and this has to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with addiction, not cannabinoids
addiction, but addiction in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our body sees addiction as a disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many years, it was thought that it is
something only psychological, nothing to
[SPEAKER_01]: be seen chemically or biochemically or
pharmacologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, today this is not accepted anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Addiction is considered to be a disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is a disease, the chances are,
we thought, that our body tries to fight
[SPEAKER_01]: against the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what our body does with most
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does our body fight addiction?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out that we do not know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not know anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the research that has been done on
addictions is on the addicted people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody has looked into those that use
compounds that cause addiction and are not
[SPEAKER_01]: addicted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't these people addicted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not addicted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, this was done in
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said before, collaboration is
essential to work in the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, we're four groups,
in addition to mine, a group in Virginia,
[SPEAKER_01]: the US, a group in Canada, and a group in
Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we meet at meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drink a lot of coffee together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We discuss things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't throw the chairs one to the
other, but we discuss things for many
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we decided to look for compounds that
maybe our body produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found a paper that a person who was
strongly addicted to nicotine and a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain part of his brain had been damaged
in a car accident was not addicted
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought maybe this part of the brain
produces a compound that blocks nicotine
[SPEAKER_01]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nobody volunteered to give his
brain, so we had to do it with mice again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had mice that were addicted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had mice that had brain damage in that
particular part of the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked for the compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, we found the compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to our great surprise, maybe,
we found that the compound belongs to the
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide-like compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a relatively simple compound,
oleic acid bound, which is a fatty acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: bound to glycine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this particular compound blocks the
formation of nicotine addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are quite a few ways of doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in a few words, we can have mice
sitting between food that contains
[SPEAKER_01]: nicotine and food that does not contain
nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is called conditioned place
preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the mice at the beginning go 50% here
and 50% there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they slowly get addicted to the
nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of them go to the part where the
nicotine is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can block this and a few other
models by administering oleic glycine to
[SPEAKER_01]: these animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they don't get addicted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this compound work in other
addictions?
[SPEAKER_01]: To the best of our knowledge, the answer
is no.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to see whether this compound,
OG, oleic glycine, can block the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing with opiates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that these particular compounds,
at reasonably high levels, can block the
[SPEAKER_01]: withdrawal symptoms, both of nicotine
addiction and of opiate addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our colleagues in Canada have now done
quite a lot of work, outstanding work,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, showing that this simple
compound can block the withdrawal
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms, not only of nicotine,
but of morphine, sometimes very often one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the treatments of opiate-addicted
people that are brought to the hospital,
[SPEAKER_01]: a given compound that will, naloxone,
that will cause withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can help the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the withdrawal can be really,
really very bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can block the addiction,
at least in mice, by giving them the oleic
[SPEAKER_01]: glycine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're trying to find out whether we
have additional compounds made by the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain, brain in mice, brain of rats,
that work against opiate addiction,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we know that not all opiate users
get addicted.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80%, 90% of them do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the others?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that here we have quite an
opening to some new ideas, maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully these ideas will bring new
drugs against the various addictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me summarize what I've been
saying over the last almost hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoids involve a large
number of physiological processes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and THC mimics their actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised that the endocannabinoids
and the endocannabinoid system were not
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered when dopamine and serotonin
were discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are important neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, because they are not more
complicated than the dopamine and
serotonin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dopamine and serotonin system,
but this is what we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the next decade, next few decades,
we shall learn quite a lot more about the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system in this respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, CBD has turned out to
be an extremely interesting compound,
[SPEAKER_01]: and again, we should know more about CBD
after clinical trials are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, we see a lot of noise
around CBD, but in most cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have no clinical trials and many of the
things we hear about CBD are just,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, out of the blue, if you wish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the third thing that I want to
mention, that the endocannabinoid-like
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, and this was the third part of
my lecture, may certainly bring new drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: to a wide variety of diseases,
and I hope that this will happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the same is true for the CB2-specific
compounds, compounds that act under CBT.
[SPEAKER_01]: CB2 receptors alone, because we see no
side effects, except in very, very unusual
[SPEAKER_01]: cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see no side effects from drugs attacked
on CB2 alone, and I want to thanks my
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborator in Israel, many of them in my
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are professor in different
departments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be in the School of Pharmacy,
some of them are in the School of
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicine, and I want to thank in
particular my collaborator abroad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it is impossible to do work in this
field, and actually in many, many other
[SPEAKER_01]: fields, by just working in one part of the
area, only in chemistry, only in
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacology, or something of that sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be done in collaboration,
because I see no difference, as a matter
[SPEAKER_01]: of fact, no scientific difference between
chemistry and pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We separate them, because we are possibly
unable to know everything about two
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: We barely know a little bit about one of
the fields, and I want to thank them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I want to thank you for being at my
lecture.
