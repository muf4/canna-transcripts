[SPEAKER_00]: Our guests today are Ed LeClair and David
McKillop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed and David have teamed up to create
HiScience, a new TV series premiering on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube today, November 27th, and that
features Medicinal Genomics and CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: David is an Emmy award-winning producer
with an impressive background in creating
[SPEAKER_00]: hit shows like Duck Dynasty and Pawn
Stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brings his storytelling expertise to
the cannabis space, teaming up with Ed to
[SPEAKER_00]: launch a show that is as entertaining as
it is informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: HiScience promises to take viewers on a
journey through the world of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on its therapeutic potential,
the people who grow it, and the science
[SPEAKER_00]: that drives it forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss Ed's
personal health journey and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired the show's creation, the show's
goal of making the medical science of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis more accessible to the public and
reducing cannabis stigma, the challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis entrepreneurs face in the
form of strict regulations, financial
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges, and the thriving black market,
how the series uses personal storytelling
[SPEAKER_00]: to balance education and entertainment,
why YouTube was chosen for its global
[SPEAKER_00]: reach and creative freedom compared to
traditional networks, and a glimpse into
[SPEAKER_00]: future seasons, which may explore other
plant medicines, such as mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with Ed
and David, I'd like to thank this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's sponsor, HiScience TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: HiScience TV shares the lively exploits of
colorful characters around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: trailblazing all things cannabis in
pursuit of the modern-day gold rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Father-son hosts Rich Battenberg Jr. and
Richard Rick Battenberg III explore
[SPEAKER_00]: legendary seed gurus, relentless
cultivators, expansive growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: pioneering product makers, and imaginative
dispensary owners as they break the
[SPEAKER_00]: barriers of this new era.
[SPEAKER_00]: The storytelling unmasks the mystical
powers of the ancient cannabis plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: its innumerable uses through dynamic
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: HiScience premieres on YouTube November
27th at youtube.com at HiScienceTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Ed
[SPEAKER_00]: LeClair and David McCullough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Ed and David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm excited to talk with both of you
today about HiScience, a new TV series
[SPEAKER_00]: premiering on YouTube today, November
27th, and it features medicinal genomics
[SPEAKER_00]: and CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The series takes viewers on a journey
through the world of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on its therapeutic potential the
people who grow it and the science that
[SPEAKER_00]: drives it forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ambitious project to say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that said, Ed, what inspired you
to create HiScience specifically about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and why now?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, back in 2018, I had acoustic
neuroma surgery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anybody knows what that is,
that's a tumor in the brain that's
[SPEAKER_02]: connected to your basically everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after surgery, I spent 33 days in the
ICU and had some issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the medicine I was on, I did not like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also believed when they did the surgery,
I don't know, 10, 12 hours, whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: was, they said it was easier to remove.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more cyst-like than the tumor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that when I found out I had
this problem, I just smoked a lot of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: because I heard it was great for cancer
and tumors and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I smoked a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that's what made it easier
to remove.
[SPEAKER_02]: The doctor doesn't think so, but that's
medical versus a cannabis guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had this idea for a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I wanted other people to
understand what cannabis was all about and
[SPEAKER_02]: managed to, through a friend, meet the
infamous David McKellop, who's now my
[SPEAKER_02]: partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what I would do without
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we make a great team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he asked me, do you really think we
could do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I do, David.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, who's going to own the IP?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, you and I, we're not going to
sell it to a network.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do everything ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes from the television world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we set out on the road to find the
most incredible OG entrepreneurs in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry from medical genomics,
being the top lead scientists in the
[SPEAKER_02]: country and around the world, to the
little guy that produces seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to really showcase these
incredible entrepreneurs and the
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible work that they're doing with
this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave all these puzzle pieces to
David.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are getting ready to launch
the show today, the 27th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight weeks, David took this and built one
hell of a beautiful puzzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is going to be great,
not only informative, educational,
[SPEAKER_02]: entertaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And David, tell us a little bit about your
background and what got you involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent most of my life as a television
programmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've headed up programming departments at
National Geographic, Discovery Channel,
[SPEAKER_01]: History, A&E.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran A&E as the general manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've spent most of my life producing
programs, everything from Deadliest Catch
[SPEAKER_01]: to Discovery to Storage Wars, Hawn Stars,
and Duck Dynasty at History and A&E.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been doing this most of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I met Ed, I kind of left the
network.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a certain limit to what you can do
in terms of your age and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's time to let the other people come
in and program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had a great run and loved what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was looking for my next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Ed approached me, I was skeptical,
to be quite honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it was like, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I allowed to say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to just sit here and do some
kind of stoner show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not what I smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked some weed when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, when I was growing up,
we actually smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never even drank until after college.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I started to meet some of the
people Ed had rounded up in this group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started to do some research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suddenly realized, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people's perception of the cannabis
industry is still squarely in this idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: a recreational drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the government and big pharmaceutical
companies all would love to have you think
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we soon discovered, where Ed had
shown some light and I did some
[SPEAKER_01]: discoveries, is that quite the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, prior to World War II,
cannabis was the go-to treatment for up to
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 different ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also the main treatment for pain
before aspirin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we began to discover that the
relationship of human evolution and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis evolution is tightly bound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's somehow gotten lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my theories on why.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it probably is people don't have
patents on it and trying to make a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take this on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a lot of money,
but we had a lot of passion in someone
[SPEAKER_01]: like Ed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we met some of the people and the
characters in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we worked hard and we all chipped in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: This became a passion for me because I
know how many people can benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most important thing is that there
have been lots of stories about people
[SPEAKER_01]: overdoing it or going into emergency
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because there's no information.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no trusted source of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government doesn't want to tell you
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmaceutical companies don't want to
tell you anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are basically finding out for
themselves how many gummies it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, an uneducated population is not
going to really be able to fully embrace
[SPEAKER_01]: what cannabis can do for the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since no one else is going to do it,
Ed and I decided that we're going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first step in this was to create
the high science TV show, which is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be an anthology series.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this first series is we're following a
family of investors, but our second,
[SPEAKER_01]: third, we could be doing something totally
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal here is to educate people at
the same time and have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I kind of got involved in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and your story is not unique to enter
the industry or the topic skeptical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then dig into the actual information
and be made a believer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear it all the time on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear it at the conferences all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's great that you're bringing
this to more and more people so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: have more believers out there and get more
great information into the hands of folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people are going to see it's
trusted information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, there's so much,
you know, what is real anymore?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so or what what what can what can you
trust to be real information or truth?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we've relied on is rather than
lecturing people about what we think it
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is we've just followed the stories of
individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: People tell their own stories from
veterans who were in very dark places,
[SPEAKER_01]: who stumbled across, literally stumbled
across cannabis that was changing their
[SPEAKER_01]: lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: People aren't going to lie about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our show is really testimonials wrapped
up in a wonderful narrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not preachy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not here creating a documentary with
a voice of God that's that's telling
[SPEAKER_01]: people they have to know about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually you're experiencing the
journeys of a lot of individuals as they
[SPEAKER_01]: come to the realization of what cannabis
can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Responsible use of cannabis can do.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've said that it's the blending of
educational content with entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there challenges in making science
and cannabis accessible to a broader
[SPEAKER_00]: audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, look, there are certain
limitations in terms of broadcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you know, what we were doing,
you know, 10 years ago would have put us
[SPEAKER_01]: in a put us in the federal penitentiary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look, storytelling is human is our way
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the secret to humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never change anybody's mind by
throwing facts at them, but you will
[SPEAKER_01]: convince people by telling them a good
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most obvious example, O.J.'s trial,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the defense had every single fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an open and shut case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all they did was they presented the
facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: O.J.'s attorneys turned around and just
gave a better story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the jury went with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this idea that we tell as human beings,
we we thrive the most in terms of learning
[SPEAKER_01]: and educating it during play and
storytelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we find the narrative and the
arc?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of that's what took Ed and
I so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once we found the narrative,
then it just fell into place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's probably never going to be
able to err on a cable channel because
[SPEAKER_01]: there are just too many standards and
practices issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still illegal on the federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertisers have certain had lots of
reservations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in some ways, I think that that's a
mark of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Courage, and I think people like to see
that, especially Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're leading the charge, kind of
pioneers, you know, you know, and and the
[SPEAKER_02]: beauty is when you look at our cast
members, they're being supported and
[SPEAKER_02]: backed up with incredible people like
Kevin McKernan, one of you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the owners of medicinal genomics,
Deedee Muir, who I think I just couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: get enough of Deedee when I was
interviewing him, he said some things that
[SPEAKER_02]: just blew me away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethan Russo, again, we were all at Canomed
and that's that's the place you really
[SPEAKER_02]: need to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys have really supported what
our cast members in the show are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And David just hit the nail on the head
when he put all these pieces together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's really look, the information
is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all these all you got, you guys have
done the most amazing work in the research
[SPEAKER_01]: and.
[SPEAKER_01]: The I mean, there's there lots of simple
concepts that we don't that the average
[SPEAKER_01]: person doesn't know or understand as
something as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you inhale cannabis,
there's only like I think it's 40 percent,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 percent or even less is is is actually
metabolized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you eat something, it can be
upwards of hires of 90 percent,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is why eating too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the difference between indoor
grows and outdoor grows?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the what is the benefit of of a
rainbow effect of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so once you start to learn all
that stuff, you begin to sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, there's something here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it actually goes back to challenge
the the way that the medical system works
[SPEAKER_01]: now, where they use a very sharp focus of
one one very specific drug for one very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific symptom cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're beginning to understand,
as you know, and this is what these
[SPEAKER_01]: stories we're going to be telling is it is
a it's it's a it's a fabric of of of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal uses that attack it as a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going from a a single shot to a
shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very very that has that has
enormous promise in terms of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm preaching to the crowd,
you know, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm getting at, I get excited
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then my job is to make the audience
get excited about it, because if they get
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about it, they can then,
you know, they can go back and educate
[SPEAKER_01]: their doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because we're not going to see,
you know, that here's an interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: statistic, 70 percent of the income for
broadcast and cable television comes from
[SPEAKER_01]: the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's where their ad revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where their revenues come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's when you if you have a who
does, I don't know who watches the news
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do watch CBS or ABC News,
try it one night broadcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single commercial is a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are only two countries in the entire
world that allow the drug companies to
[SPEAKER_01]: advertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the United States and New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every other country in the world,
it is banished.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drug companies spend more money
advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do an R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so we're up against a
monster here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and so it's no pun intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really this is where Ed convinced me
it's a grassroots duty here to get people
[SPEAKER_01]: educated on the potential of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis isn't the cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to change the entire world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is certainly a safe and organic
alternative to a lot of the kind of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: the word?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, traditional ways now that medicine
is being practiced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our job is to educate people and then
let them make their own decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not pushers.
[SPEAKER_01]: No pun intended again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're educators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, this there's a lot of
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the other thing is we don't we
only know we only know what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many how many cannabinoids are there
in a plant, something like 48 or something
[SPEAKER_01]: or 100?
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what the number is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's he would know better than us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't I don't even think we I don't
even think we fully know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we only know about a fraction of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only know about so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's so much more to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of how many are actually
tested for, too, it's even a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a there's a vast body of
knowledge that still needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so getting people excited about that
will help them, you know, encourage others
[SPEAKER_01]: and encourage their doctors and and and
lawmakers to to not just run away from
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of misrepresentation of a very
powerful drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our main characters or one of our
characters is a guy named John Piasecki.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you know, John,
he's a he's a he's a grower up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I refer to him as kind of Mr. Natural
meets Thomas Jefferson.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is just he's a genius, but he's also
just an amazing man and has incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his whole piece is that he believes
that the cannabis plant really has a
[SPEAKER_01]: coevolution with humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same way that the dog became the
one mammal that coevolved with humans,
[SPEAKER_01]: he firmly believes that the cannabis
plant, which can be traced back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: earliest known human interactions,
actually evolved in a similar way with
[SPEAKER_01]: with humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that that there's a tremendous
amount of power in that potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed got me all excited about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I can't stop talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your passion definitely, definitely comes
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you touched on a lot of great
points there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them being that, I mean,
for a lot of us in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: we take a lot of this information for
granted and assume that it's common
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge, but it really isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a show like this that's more
accessible to the general public so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can start understanding what we
already know is very powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I ran up against that one at the
History Channel, you know, when we first
[SPEAKER_01]: took over history, it was there was a lot
of criticism that we were showing shows
[SPEAKER_01]: that weren't really about history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, well, you know,
everything we do is about history.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we did find was that it it in how
television is a wonderful means of
[SPEAKER_01]: expressing emotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a terrible means of giving
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you tell, as you say, if you have
it's a great emotional that's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you see a cotton commercial and
you cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's so it has a it triggers
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one the most successful thing we
did at history was that it wasn't so much
[SPEAKER_01]: that we were just reciting like a
historical encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got people excited about history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they got excited about history,
we went from the number thirty four
[SPEAKER_01]: network up to number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people knew what they you know,
you get them excited about American
[SPEAKER_01]: history, they go onto the Internet and
they learn about it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get people excited about cannabis,
they'll start doing their research.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll come back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll find you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than having to go to the
conference, they'll be doing their own
[SPEAKER_01]: research because of their passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll find you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the other thing, the other
beauty about the show, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: think that these entrepreneurs are just
sitting back making boatloads of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fighting for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fighting for their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the millions and millions of
dollars that it takes to build a grow an
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the amount of money that it takes to
open a dispensary, the not only the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations you got, you know,
federal, state, county, parish,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, depending where you are,
which is changing daily and stick around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll change in the next 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's like, you know, banks close you
down because for no reason, because we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have safe banking in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they because you work in a
cannabis industry, you can't go buy a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't buy a house because you're using
federally legal money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the same damn money that's in
my pocket that's in yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the list goes on of what these
poor guys, men and women in this industry
[SPEAKER_02]: are fighting and we touch on on all of it
in the show to show people that,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, it's not all, you know, champagne and
pop and corks.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are actually busting their butt
because they believe so much in this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're willing to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what.
[SPEAKER_02]: High science is all about is showing all
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are a lot of a lot of things
up against folks in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just the regulations, but you have the
black market that they're competing with
[SPEAKER_00]: and now with the farm bill and have all
these loophole stores that are popping up
[SPEAKER_00]: with our hemp derived cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's a lot of things,
a lot of challenges facing the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's great that you guys are
highlighting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, those are topics we tried
to dive into as well at the conference at
[SPEAKER_00]: Can Med, helping people kind of try to
navigate this because it is a difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I found that when I tell
people what we've been up to and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: at dinner parties or friends houses and is
every single person has said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other story is I find a lot of
older people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at a like a neighborhood picnic the
other day or a couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this couple said they were in their,
I don't know, late 50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said that they had heard about,
you know, gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they decided they were going to
take a gummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they took some gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The woman said that three days later,
she was still thinking about going to the
[SPEAKER_01]: emergency room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the the thing here is that
if they had only known, that's what they
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just didn't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so educating people not only is it
good for them, in terms of empowering
[SPEAKER_01]: their wellness, but it's also a very
important protection against irresponsible
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no place to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's no consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you go and pick up a bottle
of Tylenol and know exactly what to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's so important to get the
show on the air and to start generating
[SPEAKER_01]: interest is that it's there to educate
people and an educated population on this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff is going to be good for wellness and
it's going to be good for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a bit about, you know,
how is the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can people expect when they're
watching the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that you kind of have some
characters that tie all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: stories together.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a thread.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have to have a thread and a
story, you know, and I've always been very
[SPEAKER_01]: successful with father son relationships,
whether it's pawn stars or dynasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, multiple generations tend to
people tend to be able to relate to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this particular season, you know,
we were following a group, a family of
[SPEAKER_01]: venture capitalist entrepreneurs as they
look to expand their business in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis world and in doing so,
they we created their interactions with
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody from OGs to suits to scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a bunch of hijinks that is so,
you know, in terms of family dynamics,
[SPEAKER_01]: situational comedy, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's all tied into the to the the
entertainment piece of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really just a skeleton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you hang on that skeleton,
all of these other individuals,
[SPEAKER_01]: including John Piasecki, we've got this
couple of Megan Eric up in the Berkshires
[SPEAKER_01]: who are, you know, who have been
experimenting in retail to customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have we have Mo in Arizona,
who, you know, he's kind of this he was
[SPEAKER_01]: his mother was suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he invented a type of cannabis
that's used for your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we and we've tied all of these
individuals into a storyline around this
[SPEAKER_01]: family that's out in search of of
increasing their knowledge and investments
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as I say, it's not a lecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a it's not it's kind of a reality
series.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, you know, the reality is
series are kind of misunderstood these
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but what it is, is it's very
entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's watchable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy on the eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also really informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, it's like you're getting that
information on a on a secondary and
[SPEAKER_01]: tertiary level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even know you're getting it
because you're enjoying watching the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Ed, you were originally conceived of
the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the finished product compare to
your original vision?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we were looking to go,
he fired me the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not the first person to get you fired.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been fired a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the the thing is, when we were looking
to put this on cable that were the show
[SPEAKER_02]: was so different from what I envisioned in
the very beginning, because when you go on
[SPEAKER_02]: cable, you know, you can't show this,
you can't show that you're showing too
[SPEAKER_02]: many products, you're going to dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God, you got to block all those
names out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't show smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't show somebody taking a gummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's like all of a sudden you're
doing a Seinfeld show, a show about
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we cut the cord and David really
got into the characters and how they all
[SPEAKER_02]: intertwine together, he goes, I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the show is exactly as I envisioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: David has had one hundred percent creative
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I I sit back and I really
treasure his thoughts and ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just I'm super, super excited about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just can't wait for everybody to see
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people working on this series
referred to Edna as the odd couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of we walk into a room and,
you know, I'm usually got a suit jacket on
[SPEAKER_01]: and a button down shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and they look at they kind of look
at it go, well, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: But but we work together really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I think it's because we share the
same passion, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to get people to understand the benefits
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a you know, this is a it's an
important story to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we want to tell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've mentioned future seasons
and maybe, you know, working with with
[SPEAKER_00]: different characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any, you know, people on your on
your wish list or dream collaborations or
[SPEAKER_00]: experts that you'd be interested in
featuring in future seasons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look, we could do some of the
people that we've met along the way in
[SPEAKER_01]: this season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could spin off into separate seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what it's going to become is an
anthology series, meaning that by science
[SPEAKER_01]: will come back season after season and
they'll have returning characters from
[SPEAKER_01]: different seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there'll be maybe a totally different
story being told.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is so much out there, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'd like to spin offs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some spin offs in season one that
we could spin offs and do their own
[SPEAKER_02]: series.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's people that are strong
enough to handle their own series.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we spin them off, we can add new
ones into new cast members into season two
[SPEAKER_02]: of High Science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just it's exciting to see this
all come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're you know,
we're we're going to we made a conscious
[SPEAKER_01]: decision to go out on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally think YouTube is the future
of what YouTube today is, what cable was
[SPEAKER_01]: twenty five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where you go to learn about cooking
shows that aren't competition shows and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So YouTube has a has a powerful reach into
the to the everyday common person in
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, you know, it's you don't have the
marketing machinery behind what you would
[SPEAKER_01]: have at a network.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, I think through social media
and word of mouth, build it and they will
[SPEAKER_01]: come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think YouTube is really the perfect
place for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of pushback from some of the
directors in the show because they all
[SPEAKER_01]: they said this is going to be a TV show
and it's going to be on Netflix or some
[SPEAKER_01]: other thing like that.
And.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remind them that right now,
YouTube is probably the has the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: potential audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can if we can manipulate social
media to act as our marketing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the perfect spot for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I mean, if my if my kids are any
indication, YouTube is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they want to watch is you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you when you sit back and
you think it's worldwide, it's 78 percent
[SPEAKER_02]: of the people that stream, they stream by
their hand held.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, most people have cut the
cord on the television.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beauty is not only can I watch YouTube
on my hand held, but I also have the app
[SPEAKER_02]: on my television and I can watch it on my
TV as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So or on your your iPad, your iPad,
whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so I think it's the perfect avenue for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's not to say we're not going to
go out and sell the show or license a show
[SPEAKER_02]: in other countries and and doing other
things with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we own the IP, we have that that
ability to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're starting with YouTube and we
could not be more excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people are really embracing it
that we're telling our cast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our cast members kind of scratch
their head and some of them goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, you guys are geniuses.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, let's remind people where can
they find the series and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to YouTube, not YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube and in the search column,
go up and type in high science TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to our channel, subscribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch the show for 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: Afternoon on the 27th, which is today and
just a little short time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be popping champagne
bottles because the show is coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is it going to be all all eight
episodes right from the start or are you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys going to kind of drip them out?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first two episodes are going to be on
the 27th.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have episode,
episode one and two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then every Wednesday after that at four
twenty in the afternoon is another episode
[SPEAKER_02]: for eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might take a couple of weeks off,
David.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Might take weeks off for the Christmas
holidays and kind of play some Christmas
[SPEAKER_02]: music or whatever we want to do,
show some, you know, to be jolly old St.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick taking a break, sitting down on a
rocking chair, smoking a joint,
[SPEAKER_02]: relaxing as he got some Christmas music in
the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got the long white hair so I can be
jolly St. Nick sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the show will pick back up and
we're starting to put together season two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're real excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, winding down here,
I guess, make one last pitch for the folks
[SPEAKER_00]: that are watching to watch the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how else can they connect with with
you guys and any other projects that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working on?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to high science dot com and
sign up if you sign up for the high
[SPEAKER_02]: science club, which doesn't cost you
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get it will mail you a free pin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got a high science official pin
that showed that you're part of the high
[SPEAKER_02]: science community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've started high science for twenty
mobile with some of the major mobile
[SPEAKER_02]: carriers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting ready to launch high science
travel club to tell you all the really
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting and four twenty open places that
you can go to and vacation out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the thing that I'm more
passionate about than anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: not only the show, but we started the high
science charity foundation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a percentage of all the merchandise,
a percentage of our online store,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as four twenty mobile,
a percentage goes to our charity
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation, which is helping veterans with
PTSD and mental health.
[SPEAKER_02]: David says it best.
[SPEAKER_02]: David, what's your line for the the
charity foundation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always come up with so many lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't I haven't had I haven't had my
six martinis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them on the slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've started a bunch of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's at high science dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find out all about us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find out about all our cast
members.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can read their bios.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can read David's bio and find out that
this man right here is a Emmy award
[SPEAKER_02]: winning producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He uses them to hold his doors open at his
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's just a really exciting the
amount of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to meet Kelly Moe Fomos,
Johnny Greenfingers, Megan, Eric,
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin McConnell and Brendan.
[SPEAKER_02]: The list goes on of all these cast members
and the incredible work they're doing in
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could not be more excited to be
sitting on a side of David watching our
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes as we go live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know when we realize these things
take time to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we've we've managed our
expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other thing about YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we're launching after a
multimillion dollar ad campaign and buses
[SPEAKER_01]: ads on buses in New York City and
billboards in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do believe it's like a diesel
engine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it takes a while to get those
guys up to speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you hit your your your once you
hit your RPMs, they're almost impossible
[SPEAKER_01]: to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll be we'll be we're going to be
manage our expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are 100 percent behind this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody that we have been working
with is 100 percent behind this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody who I have to say shout out to
all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of no one is no one has been paid for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other thing people have are
doing this out of the out of the their
[SPEAKER_01]: their passion to get this information
across.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that when you do something
like that and you have that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: passion and personal commitment,
success may take time, but it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one thing I want to I want to
say, Deedee Muir, I keep going back to
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible scientists work with me,
Shulam, the father of cannabis in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The list goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked Deedee, I said, Deedee,
could you tell me the difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because season one, we're in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Season two, we might go into mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where we're going to go,
but we need to explore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, Ed, Ed, Ed, Ed, Ed,
sit back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, what's the issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Deedee, he goes, Ed, cannabis is the
little village.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, but mushrooms is the kingdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, I'm telling you, just wait and
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to know telling where
season two is going to take us,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're going to be exploring this plant
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a lot to be said for what what
Mother Nature has put on this earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping also that people will see
the show and then contact us, because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I think it's just the tip of the
iceberg of who we've there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: serendipity in terms of who we've been
able to to rope in and meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm hoping that the series will bring
all kinds of interesting people out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: woodwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and so it will start to grow
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to that's what's really
going to be exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's also excited for the for
the people we're showcasing in the series,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it's great it puts a face
to a lot of a lot of these products and it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually puts a human face to the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the basis of the series
is we're putting a human face with a human
[SPEAKER_01]: story on some really exciting and complex
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we can help just one person through
education in a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we can shed some light to our
politicians that something needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: done with federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we can be instrumental in helping
through the show with safe banking to
[SPEAKER_02]: really help these guys out in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keeping my fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got everything crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loves the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can bring some education and
entertainment in people's lives with high
[SPEAKER_02]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very excited on our end to see the
premiere later today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have links to all the resources that
we talked about in the show description so
[SPEAKER_00]: people can easily find the show and find
the website and everything that we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we're big supporters of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely we're definitely a part
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll continue to promote it in the
coming weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get as many eyeballs on it as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for being a really fantastic
partner as we made this series.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to many more
opportunities as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a shared vision and
definitely a village.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grassroots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grassroots.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
