[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for
coming to CanMed 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Kyle Boyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the vice chair of the American
Chemical Society's Cannabis Chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: subdivision, and today we're going to be
talking about heavy metal contaminants in
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizer cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know vape cartridges have really been in
the news lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not exactly going to be tackling the
cutting agents and diluents, but
[SPEAKER_01]: nevertheless, this is a really important
topic that I think we need to explore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did do this work with Eni Afia,
who's here in the crowd, with CannaSafe,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I want to thank them for being so
gracious and letting me invade their lab
[SPEAKER_01]: over the weekends, and we also did this in
collaboration with Robert Weltman,
[SPEAKER_01]: who is a doctoral student getting his PhD
in public health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'll dive in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Firstly, I do want to give some
disclaimers and disclosures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Eni is a principal at CannaSafe
Analytics, which is a compliance testing
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory here in Los Angeles,
California, and one thing I do really want
[SPEAKER_01]: to stress about this work is that it is
done with very limited sample sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a pilot study and it's ongoing,
so really, by no measure should we be
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the data that's presented here and
ultimately drawing final conclusions on
[SPEAKER_01]: the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did it all start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, phase three compliance testing
kicked in on January 1st, 2019,
[SPEAKER_01]: here in California, and that basically
mandated that we had to test for the big
[SPEAKER_01]: four heavy metals, so that is arsenic,
cadmium, lead, mercury, and basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: here are the different action levels that
you see for all the different product
[SPEAKER_01]: types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you'll notice for the inhaled
goods, this is on the lower end of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're particularly going to be focusing in
on lead today, because that is what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: really seeing out there as a problem in
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it started with this compliance
need for people, so these vape cart
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers started to test their
cartridges prior to this new phase of
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance kicking in, and what the vape
cart manufacturers were seeing across the
[SPEAKER_01]: board is most of them were not meeting the
mark and they were failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw a lot of different headlines
that were very concerning, things like lab
[SPEAKER_01]: testing reveals like there's lead in most
vape cartridges, and also things like it
[SPEAKER_01]: is worse than reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people were really concerned about
this, especially the cart manufacturers
[SPEAKER_01]: who couldn't get their products on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we actually asked around for COAs
for some of these things, we saw a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: different results all across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll notice on the lower end on some
of these lead at 20% or 25 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million, but you could see almost 11,000
parts per million in some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a big question here,
and that is, well, is this a big variance
[SPEAKER_01]: in spread that we're seeing across these
different cart manufacturers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also got to ask the question
about who is doing the testing and how are
[SPEAKER_01]: they doing it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, we don't have any reference
methods to draw upon to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: standardize the testing of these vaporizer
cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some questions that come to mind is,
how are you doing the digestion of these
[SPEAKER_01]: vape cartridges?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you simply taking the whole cart and
running it through digestion fluid?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then analyzing, are you letting your
digestion fluid soak on the carts and the
[SPEAKER_01]: parts where it's actually having contact?
[SPEAKER_01]: Without knowing what people are doing,
really all these results don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: strong meaning because we can't compare to
one another, really, because everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this also propagated even further
across social media, and that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: really drew our attention is how scared
people were about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the cart manufacturers,
but also the people who are interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: public health and understanding are my
vape cartridges safe for consumption?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to give a shout out to a couple
different groups that really helped spur
[SPEAKER_01]: this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: California City and County Regulation
Watch was really great because it allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: for real-time interaction with those in
the community who were dealing with it on
[SPEAKER_01]: the front lines, people whose fingers are
on the pulse, and they're constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: posting and letting us know what's going
on out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also Cannabis Science and
Chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a moderator for that group on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of great scientific
discourse that's happening online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not your traditional forum for
scientific discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of really bright folks in there
that are bringing some of these topics to
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while not currently engaged in cannabis
regulation, the FDA does deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-market tobacco products and different
nicotine delivery systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll notice that there's an overlap
in some of the things that we are testing
[SPEAKER_01]: for for these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, the big four, cadmium and
lead, would be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also they're testing for things like
chromium and nickel, as well as some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the heating elements associated with
nicotine devices also have these involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also for these devices,
it's necessary to conduct analysis of the
[SPEAKER_01]: e-liquids and aerosols in your product due
to the substances outlined here that are
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially harmful constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of these are produced in response
to the actual vaping process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had some questions to answer in this
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, does storing the cannabinoids
containing solutions that we developed
[SPEAKER_01]: lead to appreciable levels of the big four
heavy metals in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if the metals are indeed leaching
into the extract, can we quantify that
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio of the big four heavy metals in the
pre-vape cartridges to the post-vape
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridges?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the condensed material from
that vaporization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how does the storage time as
well, and the residence time inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: these cartridges, affect the amount of
leaching that occurs during vaporization?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also wanted to know,
how did the chemical constituents of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different solutions affect the leaching of
heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to actually answer these questions,
we sourced a number of suspected
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated cartridges out there from a
few different manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we filled them with realistic
extract solutions containing THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: distillates, terpenes, and various
different cutting agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also ran these through a
smoking machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we captured the condensate in order to
test the concentrations of the metals that
[SPEAKER_01]: could potentially carry over into the end
user's lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are some of the different cutting
agents and diluents that you see on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the left, we've got PG, VG,
PEG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure many of you have heard of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the news, in particular, we have the
alpha-tocopherol and the tocopherol
[SPEAKER_01]: acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think tocopherol acetate is one we're
really concerned about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The alpha-tocopherol, someone does have a
patent on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been used safely, to my knowledge,
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you've also got things like
viscosity by true terpenes and thickener
[SPEAKER_01]: by fluoroplex.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are cutting agents and diluents that
don't even have ingredients listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's certainly going to
change here, especially in light of the
[SPEAKER_01]: recent events with all the vaping illness
that has been happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we did use in the study was
two different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we chose to use medium chain
triglycerides, or MCT oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you commonly see in heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used in health food stores,
things like Whole Foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: People make their bulletproof coffee with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also one of the most common
cutting agents on the black market
[SPEAKER_01]: currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, we sourced some tech temper
from abstracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is another one with
proprietary components.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some friends in the vape industry were
telling me that this is what's commonly
[SPEAKER_01]: used as a cutting agent for some of these
CBD pens, because they're actually not
[SPEAKER_01]: miscible at higher concentrations than the
MCT.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the CBD carts, we used that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also made a terpene blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't get to do enough of these
terpene blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just one of them that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sourced some terpenes from two terpenes
in fluoroplex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I essentially copied this formulation
that they had online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did we choose this one in particular?
[SPEAKER_01]: No particular reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really like terpenylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my favorite terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, it's mostly terpenylene
with a bunch of other minor components as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did we actually make this smoking
machine?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't have any funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was sort of just a fun project
that we just decided to investigate
[SPEAKER_01]: further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we were curious about answering
these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, Robert, who I collaborated
with, is very handy with basically making
[SPEAKER_01]: something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found something in the literature
that would enable us to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tried to copy it as best we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took a modified aquarium pump and
basically flipped the solenoid on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we took an Arduino, which allows
us to program the pump that we use so that
[SPEAKER_01]: it would do exactly what we wanted to at
the given time points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we took a Y connector adapter and
placed it into an Eppendorf tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we parafilmed that shut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then affixed all of this together with
a bunch of different tubing, different
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties of tubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we affixed this all to a vape
battery with a cartridge attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is a photo there of the actual
setup itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's the smoking machine protocol
that we developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we programmed the pump to automatically
inhale for 12 seconds with 30 seconds of
[SPEAKER_01]: downtime in between the puffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The battery had an automatic off function
after 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we already know that each puff was 10
seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That last two seconds was used to clear
any residual vapor that was left in the
[SPEAKER_01]: tubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we recovered and spun down any
remaining oil that was found in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridge after the vaporization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also collected the condensate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we analyzed all of these
according to Candice Sayer's SOP for heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, before we test anything,
we want to make sure that everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're putting into these carts is clean to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not going to impact the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are all the different things we
source to put in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have THC and CBD distillate,
the MCT, the Durbin poison turps,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the TEC temper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see here that the highest
amounts were found in the TEC temper and
[SPEAKER_01]: the THC distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, these are still just at
0.1 part per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, we shouldn't see anything much
above that in any of the resulting
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is the actual sample prep and
ICP-MS method that we ran.
[SPEAKER_01]: So digestion, fairly standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took our sample and we placed it in a
digestion vessel, added four mils of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitric acid and then one mil of
hydrochloric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we digested this in a milestone
ultrawave at 250 C and 120 bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as the actual method goes,
we were calibrated for all four analytes
[SPEAKER_01]: across 0 to 50 PPB, five point
calibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for our different LODs and LOQs,
those are all listed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between 2 and 30 PPB, depending on the
analyte we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as the acceptance
criteria, the BCC does have these
[SPEAKER_01]: different acceptable ranges of recoveries
that you should have for things like your
[SPEAKER_01]: CCVs to ensure the instrument is
functioning properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 80 to 120% is that acceptable range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, your R squared should look
good as well and be greater than 0.99.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for our pilot data, what we did is we
sourced some cartridges from a California
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer that this had already
basically failed for compliance testing
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were in quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time we got the stuff,
it had already been sitting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridge for six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd already known that it failed
compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had some inkling that there was
definitely going to be some metals in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see here, over three times
the action level for lead was found in
[SPEAKER_01]: this particular cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also ran it through the smoking machine
and we were able to recover very close to
[SPEAKER_01]: the action level of lead, which
essentially represents what would end up
[SPEAKER_01]: in the end user's lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that came out at about 480 parts per
billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one month post-filling data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are the different carts that we
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll notice here that all in yellow,
all of the different carts that we tested,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the condensate, but the actual cart
itself, what was remaining after the
[SPEAKER_01]: vaping, it all contained near the
California action levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was really interesting is for our
most interesting data point, we had one in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular that exceeded the California
levels by 13 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, for that particular data
point, we weren't able to actually collect
[SPEAKER_01]: enough condensate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We aren't exactly sure what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for that particular one, we removed
from our statistical analysis just because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was such a big outlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really don't know if that
particular cart just happened to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these things are manufactured in China
with not a lot of oversight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the homogeneity between cart to cart
may not be all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as our statistical analysis
goes, we did a t-test to compare the
[SPEAKER_01]: different sample means.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we basically did see statistically
significant differences for most
[SPEAKER_01]: comparisons with the exception of cadmium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also conducted a paired t-test
for the condensate versus the remaining
[SPEAKER_01]: oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did see a statistically significant
difference for all of the differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also did a pre-vapor testing
to compare the different analytes that we
[SPEAKER_01]: tested for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as the means go,
in our pre-vapor testing, we did show that
[SPEAKER_01]: none of our starting materials contained
levels of heavy metals that approached any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the action levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in some of our post-vapor
experiments, we saw levels as high as 2
[SPEAKER_01]: ppm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also saw higher levels in the
oil that remained in the cart compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: what was recovered in the condensate by a
factor of about 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when comparing all of the
post-vapor to the pre-vapor, we see an
[SPEAKER_01]: increase by about a factor of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we remove that outlier data
point, we see an increase by a factor of
[SPEAKER_01]: about 2.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the two-month post-filling
data, ultimately what we did see was that
[SPEAKER_01]: levels in all cartridges were on average
higher for the two-month data point in
[SPEAKER_01]: comparison to that one-month data point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see here all of these different
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It suggests that we're definitely over the
action level.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two did not, in particular,
that are not bolded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, in all of the end
products, we did see, or not all the end
[SPEAKER_01]: products, half the end products,
we did see that we exceed the action level
[SPEAKER_01]: for at least two out of the four.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, yeah, all the products
contained about a two- to eight-fold
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in the amounts of lead after
about two months of sitting in these
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to give some context for
these different data points that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's consider the 2008 ambient air
quality standard for lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's at exposure of about 0.15
micrograms per cubic meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would amount to a dose of about
2.4 micrograms over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you wanted to actually get to those
same levels, you would actually have to
[SPEAKER_01]: vape almost five of these full-gram
cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to achieve that same level of
exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, in the context of OSHA,
the permissible exposure action level is
[SPEAKER_01]: about 30 micrograms per cubic meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get about a mean exposure of 160
micrograms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, you would have to smoke 320
cartridges in a single day in order to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think we can all agree that no
level of lead is good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do want to give some context to
these numbers just because we don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to raise the alarm specifically if it's
not something that is really overly
[SPEAKER_01]: concerning in a capacity like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, if you were at the permissible
exposure limit for OSHA, you would have to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke over 500 of these cartridges in an
eight-hour shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that would put undergraduate
Kyle to shame, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did have some limitations in the
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, again, pilot data.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is by no means perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did want to get some inklings as to
what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely a potential for
interlot variability between the different
[SPEAKER_01]: brands of cartridges that we tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, China doesn't have the best
oversight on some of these manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could potentially see one cart that
has much more contamination than another,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if they came from the same lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also quite a bit of
variability in the different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: carts that you see out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tried to do the best we could to
mimic what is out there on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could see anywhere with things
with tons of vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't use that as a representation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is out there in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't take every single cartridge
and make something that's realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can do the best that we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have a lack of replicate samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we sourced all these carts from
just different sources from the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: and friends of ours that are in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't have a whole lot of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we weren't able to do replicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would certainly help in future
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, realistic vaping.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smoking machine itself is not meant to
actually represent the puff topography of
[SPEAKER_01]: what is normally done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to take a best representation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, nobody is always hitting a
vape pen exactly for 10 seconds,
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting 30 seconds for downtime,
and then continuing to puff on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people also don't smoke a whole
cartridge in a single setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, the differences in
vaporizer battery settings out there are
[SPEAKER_01]: very wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did in this particular study
was we used an e-cigarette battery that
[SPEAKER_01]: would basically sense the voltage and
resistance that is meant for that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular cart type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew that we weren't going to be
cooking this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, again, this is just one
setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are many different settings that
you find out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only used one standard power rating of
7.4 watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least we could get some consistency
across the different samples that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some future questions for this work that
we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the speciation of heavy metals is
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these metals that we're seeing there
in the inorganic or the inorganic,
[SPEAKER_01]: the organic or inorganic form,
because that's really going to play a
[SPEAKER_01]: factor into how bad this could be for
human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: For future work, we also need larger
sample sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just use a limited sample size
and draw conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd also like to see some interlock
variation testing just to see if there is
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency in the manufacturing of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it would be good to also see some
different terpene formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we chose terpene dominant
simply because that's the terpene of
[SPEAKER_01]: choice for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would be great to see some of these
other terpenes, especially I think terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohols would be interesting to see
because terpenes, of course, are solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could certainly impact the
leaching of some of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: components into the extract itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also want to know,
do other heavy metals leach aside from the
[SPEAKER_01]: big four?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we're focused on the big four
in California because that's what's
[SPEAKER_01]: mandated to be tested for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do we see anything else like nickel or
chromium and things like that as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those could also present some
health challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also want to test more cartridges
and formulations sitting in these things
[SPEAKER_01]: after a longer length of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I think is interesting in particular
with our two-month data point in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular is that we actually saw a
flipping that happened where we saw more
[SPEAKER_01]: of this stuff ending up in the condensate
in particular than the actual cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that suggests to me, I was actually
discussing with Dr. Rogan about this
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, that suggests to me that,
well, if these things are sitting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridge, the actual coil itself,
everything is breaking down, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, terpenes are solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these cutting agents may be aiding in
the breakdown of the metal coil that is
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were curious to test more samples
so we can get a better understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: what exactly is happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in conclusion, we were able to show
that a low-cost modified air sampling pump
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to produce condensate that we
collected in an Empedorf tube for analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we recovered the remaining solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, we were able to see that
there were elevated concentrations of
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals in here compared to the
starting materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even without vaping, we still saw
that many of these cartridges,
[SPEAKER_01]: two out of four, still exceeded the action
level for lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ultimately, we still need to do more
work on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is still very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully, this paves the way as a
cheap and easy way to do this type of
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis so that we can ensure that
consumers are safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I want to thank you all for
your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm open to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Boyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Timely and valuable data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them might be a little silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is, did you notice any
organoleptic visual or quality differences
[SPEAKER_02]: with the oils that you could kind of see
with just your senses that might tip off
[SPEAKER_02]: that they were heavy in metals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Color consistency, something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the oils that went in,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because remember, we tested all these
things prior to beginning any work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew right off the bat that the
highest levels we would see were 0.1 ppm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be if we had just used pure
distillate or the pure TEC temper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second one is, do you have plans
to do spiking and recovery data?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would help to validate your
experimental model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe more people might use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take heavy metals, spike it into samples,
and measure that recovery data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, this is a pilot study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great to actually do some
further validation on this method to show
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can actually, indeed, recover all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that would give researchers a
lot more confidence to use this method and
[SPEAKER_01]: move forward with it as a way to do more
analysis of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beth Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question about the thinners and
whether some of the thinners might carry
[SPEAKER_04]: more of the lead or break down the metal
and release some of the lead than the
[SPEAKER_04]: other thinners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually think, based on the data
that we saw, more of it is actually to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with the terpenes themselves and the
cutting agents, although those with just
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting agents and no terpenes still
exhibited a significant amount of leaching
[SPEAKER_01]: that had occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that we did see higher
levels in the condensate for those with
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, terpenes being solvents,
I think those are the main contributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's certainly complex chemistry
going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on the data that we have,
we can't actually isolate which of these
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be the greater contributors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were there any terpenes that were worse?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you just tested the same terpenes on
all, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We tested only one terpene formulation,
and that was a terpenylene dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great to see more work with
things like terpene alcohols, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think those could certainly lead to more
leaching in particular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of piggybacking on what she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to the terpenes,
the other additives, you showed MCT oil
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these other things, is there any
way to test?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the consumer knows that this is going
to be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to get lead from any of
those other things potentially?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lead is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low levels can be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ultimately, I think it's best for all
manufacturers, whatever they're putting in
[SPEAKER_01]: their products, that they should be
testing all the materials, not just the
[SPEAKER_01]: final product, just to know where these
sources of contamination could be coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like I said, lead is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have to know your source and
ensure that everything that's going into a
[SPEAKER_01]: product for consumption has been tested
prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for California regulations,
is the company required to test the
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge with all of these things,
and they all must pass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just the THC that has to pass the
testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: For BCC regulations here in California,
the final product has to be tested,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the constituents going into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, some of the more
responsible manufacturers may be testing
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the different components prior to
it so that they have some indication of
[SPEAKER_01]: what they should see in their end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there was major lead contamination
in the cartridge from something else that
[SPEAKER_00]: was added, a terpene or another additive,
that would be showing up in these tests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is not mandated for these
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the more responsible cart
manufacturers and producers will be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this type of testing to ensure that
consumers are safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question that kind of follows up
what you were saying, that you were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking a lot about the cartridges are
being made in China mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is not a lot of quality control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems to be influencing the
leaching, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm guessing that most of that is
coming from the heating mechanism.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this true?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it also coming from other parts of
the cartridge?
[SPEAKER_03]: And have you compared that to glass
cartridges versus plastic?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how far have we been able to get
that information?
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't been able to test specific
parts of the cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just looking at the whole
cartridges themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, what's going to cause
leaching, I think, is what the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: solution is in contact with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it would be great to actually
dissect some of these cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see some of the folks who did
their testing prior to January 1 were
[SPEAKER_01]: actually disassembling the different
pieces of the vape cartridges to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand where the contamination was
coming from in the cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this particular work did not focus on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think future work should take a look
at that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not actually the fact that the
solution is just sitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that it's sitting in a cartridge,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly, in contact with the
components that do have the heavy metal
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination, which leads to this
ultimate leaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your view, is there an excipient or
diluting that might be better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I don't know if I want to use the word
safer to use in these products,
[SPEAKER_02]: like PGVG versus MCT oil versus a
long-chain fatty acids sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, I don't think we have enough
data to make any conclusive statements
[SPEAKER_01]: about what is safe in terms of these
different cutting agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, a lot of these things don't
even have ingredients lists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how could you determine that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If these things aren't readily made
available to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that more work needs to be done
to establish what kind of cutting agents
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
