[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk Podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in November already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what that means?
[SPEAKER_00]: The holidays are right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that comes a lot of things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got people to buy for, parties to plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it be nice if you could check
something off your to-do list right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can register for CanMed 23.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't already heard, CanMed 23
will be taking place May 15th through 17th
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Marriott Beach Resort on Marco
Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry-leading event will feature
three full days of cannabis science
[SPEAKER_00]: content from more than 30 presenters and
instructors representing our key focus
[SPEAKER_00]: areas of science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And new for CanMed 23, we will also
explore psilocybin and psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, due to the limited capacity of our
new location, CanMed 23 is an invitation
[SPEAKER_00]: only event, and we expect that it will
sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've already gotten your
invitation to CanMed 23, please register
[SPEAKER_00]: and get that off your to-do list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't, head over to
CanMedEvents.com now and request your
[SPEAKER_00]: invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Dr. Swathi Varanasi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Swathi is a bilingual pharmacist
specializing in integrative and
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Swathi has paved the way for other
health care professionals to pursue
[SPEAKER_00]: non-traditional career paths through
creating post-doctoral training programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: industry internships, and online courses
focused on integrative medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: patient-centered shared decision-making.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discussed how
Dr. Swathi found cannabis medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: developed an interest in it, how
pharmacists can help cannabis patients
[SPEAKER_00]: with drug-to-drug interactions,
the lack of education about the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system for pharmacists and
other health care professionals,
[SPEAKER_00]: how difficult it can be for health care
professionals to find trusted sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: information around cannabis medicine,
whether pharmacists should be accessible
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis dispensaries, and
cannabimimetics, the things we can do to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve our endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Swathi, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Medicine Women Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine Women's team of specialists
includes medical doctors, natural paths,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis experts, nutritionists,
and alternative health practitioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: These integrative teams evaluate health
issues and design targeted protocols to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote personal healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine Women's protocols have
successfully alleviated symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, autoimmune diseases, and
neurological conditions, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: providing overall health regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us
[SPEAKER_00]: on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to talk with you today because
I believe you are the first pharmacist
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've had on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, I'm the first?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and hopefully not the last because I
know that you have written and spoken
[SPEAKER_00]: about the important role that pharmacists
play in helping patients navigate their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we dig into that, I was hoping
you could tell us a bit about how you got
[SPEAKER_00]: interested or got started in cannabis
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing up, I was around Ayurvedic
herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always was kind of in this bridge
between the conventional and
[SPEAKER_01]: unconventional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the East meets West.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was always very interested in the
preventative side of healing and really
[SPEAKER_01]: how we can work with prescriptions and
whether that's in conjunction if we add
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs, if we add any other healing
modalities, whether it be nutrition or
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about sleep hygiene or homeopathy,
therapeutic aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always interested in how a health
care professional could guide a patient
[SPEAKER_01]: with all these different modalities that
could potentially work for someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to me, when I saw a pharmacist in a
pharmacy, I saw them standing between the
[SPEAKER_01]: prescriptions and the supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going to pharmacy school, I really
thought there would be a wide array of
[SPEAKER_01]: information on all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as some people probably know,
the pharmacy curriculum is very clinically
[SPEAKER_01]: driven, very clinically focused,
and it's very specific about prescription
[SPEAKER_01]: medications more than the other side of
healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was drawn to how can I be that health
care professional that looks at both
[SPEAKER_01]: sides, that sees the value in both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how I found integrative
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found an incredible mentor out in L
.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time I was going to school in
South Carolina and I grew up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really was just on a whim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just messaged this Appy preceptor
saying, you know, like what you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: is so inspirational.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to do a rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's Dr. Pam Tarlo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a chance to do a rotation with her
and just a few days into the rotation,
[SPEAKER_01]: realized, wow, like this is absolutely
where I fit in pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I've been searching for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I asked her if there was a way that
I could move to L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: after graduation and train with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our conversations from there kind
of evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to the point where we were
like, you know, we should start a postdoc
[SPEAKER_01]: doctoral residency training program for
pharmacists interested in pursuing this,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, unconventional path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with her, we created the two of us
created this integrative health pharmacy
[SPEAKER_01]: residency program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was the first resident as well as
the co-founder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was really able to craft my entire
experience and training around what I
[SPEAKER_01]: really wanted to learn about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept coming back to herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept coming back to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just so fascinated by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I always say that like the
nerdiest people love cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system because it's this
brand new, exciting thing to learn about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we don't get a lot of
information in our whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: undergraduate or postgraduate curriculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found that just I just kept coming
back over and over being like,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, there's so much here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the way that cannabis or other herbs
altogether can really heal people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I did a lot of work in cannabis
during my training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, continue to do a lot
of different educational opportunities and
[SPEAKER_01]: different education programs, whether they
were, you know, creating online courses or
[SPEAKER_01]: creating other training programs for other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I've done a wide array of
things, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: really what I think is most important is
patient centered shared decision making.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really putting the patient at
the center of every discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as an Inuit health pharmacist,
it's really important to me to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what the patient's treatment goals are and
then kind of crafting a perfect plan that
[SPEAKER_01]: works for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, a plan that's going to work
to achieve their overall treatment goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's really like this like
conversation and this like collaboration
[SPEAKER_01]: with the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, you know, if let's say a patient
comes to me and says, I'm having issues
[SPEAKER_01]: with insomnia, I mean, there are so many
different ways we can talk about healing
[SPEAKER_01]: insomnia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always say, you know, sleep doesn't
just happen at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's so many things we can do
during the day that can also help with our
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and quantity of sleep,
whether that's, you know, the utilization
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabinoids, whether that's talking
about sleep hygiene, nutrition,
[SPEAKER_01]: then a lot of the other modalities that I
mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really it comes down to what the
patient wants and then how I can help them
[SPEAKER_01]: with my knowledge base being wide and
expansive of all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that one of the main roles that
pharmacists can play is helping patients
[SPEAKER_00]: navigate these drug to drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could speak a bit
more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's definitely true and
definitely something that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: important that that I wish more people
talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish there was more focus in medical
professional curriculum on this,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, for example, with
cannabis, there are certain drugs that if
[SPEAKER_01]: I see them on a patient profile,
they're an automatic red flag to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, as incredible as cannabis is,
there are other really great herbs that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have as many drug interactions that
maybe could be a better fit for a patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on their specific scenario and
what they want to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to me, you know, there are some,
you know, anti convulsant medications,
[SPEAKER_01]: like anti-seizure medications like
clobazam or valproic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are big red flags to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there are some other
medications out there that I might have
[SPEAKER_01]: caution with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like a much longer list,
but those are two definitely that are red
[SPEAKER_01]: flags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then another one would be warfarin,
which you might have heard of warfarin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Warfarin literally interacts with
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's also one of those medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I see a patient on that, and I actually
just got an email yesterday from a
[SPEAKER_01]: patient, one of the things, so I
co-founded a CBD wellness brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that we offer are
consultations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have like an Ask Dr. Swafi part of
the page where anyone can message me a
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I received an email yesterday of
someone asking like, Oh, can I incorporate
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD into my regimen?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, like, what would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what dose would you recommend on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I had to get more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the customer responded back saying,
you know, this is my drug list.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing I ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people want to incorporate
cannabis or CBD or any herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I see your current drug list of the
medications, supplements, and herbs that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're taking regularly?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this person came back and warfarin
was on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I unfortunately had to say,
you know, the cannabis is not the right
[SPEAKER_01]: choice for you, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And always the conversation comes down to
benefit versus risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we can optimize the benefit
while decreasing the risk, that's always
[SPEAKER_01]: the goal when it comes to incorporating
anything new into a regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the things we
always have to keep in mind with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know, there are some examples
where it's not necessarily a good fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know we like to think that it's
it's an all upside sort of sort of option
[SPEAKER_00]: for people because it's a natural product
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like you just pointed out,
there are certain people who are on
[SPEAKER_00]: certain medications that it's just not
going to work for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one of the myths that I
like to debunk is that just because it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural product doesn't mean that it's
safe for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like a lot of mushrooms are
poisonous and those are naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't necessarily mean that
everything in nature is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily be like a safe option for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and there's usually some pushback from
the industry when when we point out that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some potential dangers just
because, you know, prohibition is still on
[SPEAKER_00]: the minds of everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, any sort of bad news about
cannabis is taken, taken poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we need to have an adult
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: About it and just make sure people know
that proceed with caution in some in some
[SPEAKER_00]: instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering if you could talk a bit
more about how how patients can sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: access pharmacists, because I know that,
you know, a lot of people, myself
[SPEAKER_00]: included, the rare times that we interact
with pharmacists is just when we pick up a
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription from CVS and they ask if we
have any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we typically just say no and grab our
prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how how can we better use pharmacists
not just in cannabis, but in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, pharmacists are the drug
experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're the ones that know the most
information about these medications that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're picking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we're the people that should know
most about, you know, what's going on with
[SPEAKER_01]: the supplements and the herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as much as that,
I would love for that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really the case all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really hope and I want to be a part
of building up a lot of this current
[SPEAKER_01]: curriculum for various health care
professionals where if, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of brands will say, go ask your
doctor or like, oh, we can't answer that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask your doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the thing that worries me is that
a lot of the quote unquote doctors or
[SPEAKER_01]: providers or pharmacists don't know a lot
of this nitty gritty detail to really
[SPEAKER_01]: help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, when it comes to that,
then the patient just feels really lost
[SPEAKER_01]: and not heard and not seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the last thing we want is a
patient to not get the answers they're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the root of all of that really
is this need for education and the need
[SPEAKER_01]: for there to be access to this kind of
information that's evidence based,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's scientifically driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always joke that like right now we're in
this sea of misinformation right now with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, where everyone is posting about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, anecdotes are great,
but we can't base scientific decision
[SPEAKER_01]: making.
[SPEAKER_01]: on anecdotes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to understand that,
you know, who are the experts,
[SPEAKER_01]: who are the trusted sources of information
and where can we find it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once more health care providers
have access, they'll be able to really
[SPEAKER_01]: answer those questions that pharmacists
included.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say, out of all the
questions I received by email or via
[SPEAKER_01]: LinkedIn, most of them are from
pharmacists and they're wanting to know
[SPEAKER_01]: how to answer these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because truth be told, I mean,
patients and customers are asking about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't want to say, oh,
just don't take it because that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the go-to response a lot of the
time for providers is because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're optimizing benefit
versus risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to them, if they don't know that
there could be a potential benefit,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just want to decrease the risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then their go-to response would just be
like, oh, don't take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm seeing more and more people
messaging me asking, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like these number of patients keep coming
to me and asking me about CBD and whether
[SPEAKER_01]: they can use it for, you know,
pain or to improve their sleep quality or
[SPEAKER_01]: this, that, and the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to know how to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to know that they can be a
trusted source of information for their
[SPEAKER_01]: patient, which honestly is very inspiring
that these health care providers are out
[SPEAKER_01]: there interacting with people daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to be able to provide that
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're looking online and trying to
find people that they can message that
[SPEAKER_01]: they trust to get this info.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that there are people
messaging about it really means that there
[SPEAKER_01]: is this need for widespread education to
help providers that can thereby help the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine it must be difficult too
with, with cannabis medicine in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, because the endocannabinoid
system, it's, you know, involved in almost
[SPEAKER_00]: every system in the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to imagine that there is going
to be some interaction with, with any
[SPEAKER_00]: medication that you're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so back to the education part and,
you know, maybe sort of some of the lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of information part, how much of that is
that there's just not enough information
[SPEAKER_00]: out there about some of these drug to drug
interactions, just because I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is so new and the studies just
haven't been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So partially, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, some of it is that there isn't
information out there, but more than
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else, it's like there needs to be
an overall understanding of the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis works in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, for example, the way it's
metabolized in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we understand that, you know,
CBD and THC are metabolized by the SIP 450
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an enzyme system in the body
that really does metabolize the majority
[SPEAKER_01]: of medications on the market medication,
meaning prescription options on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that means that there is a
possibility that there could be
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even if there aren't studies,
okay, at this point, there are some,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there are not an extensive amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to just look at how cannabis
actually works in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we understand how they're
metabolized, AKA how they're broken down
[SPEAKER_01]: in the body, then we can really
understand, okay, then there could be
[SPEAKER_01]: potential drug interactions if other
medications are metabolized by the same
[SPEAKER_01]: exact enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, this is not unlike thinking
about other drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many drug interaction conversations
that, you know, that I've had or that I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned about in school or in training or
afterwards really comes down to what
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes are metabolizing these substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're metabolized by the same
substance, it's possible one could get in
[SPEAKER_01]: the way of the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at the end of the day, yes,
studies are great and studies are the
[SPEAKER_01]: ideal, you know, benchmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we have a general understanding of
how these things work in the body,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we can turn to that before looking
at, you know, very specific PKPB studies,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now to help sort of patients avoid
some of these drug to drug interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, and I don't know what the legalities
are around this or anything, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if someone were to be getting one of those
red flag medications from a pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_00]: can or should the pharmacist be asking if
they are using cannabis as a supplement
[SPEAKER_00]: or?
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be my ideal situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think that that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish there was a way that in any
pharmacy it would even come up as a flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like on the pharmacist's side,
certain medications will pop up with like
[SPEAKER_01]: different flags and warnings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love if that was an option and
that was integrated into their system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other side of that is
actually, you know, kind of like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are some states that do have
it mandated that pharmacists be almost
[SPEAKER_01]: like a pharmacist in charge of the
dispensary, which I think is an incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I absolutely think that that's the
right way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And granted, these are a lot of seats
where it's not recreationally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more medically legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some states really getting
it right and incorporating pharmacists in
[SPEAKER_01]: every single, you know, initial patient
consult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like any patient who's new to that
dispensary would come with their med list
[SPEAKER_01]: and be able to talk to a pharmacist that
would in theory be trained on how these
[SPEAKER_01]: drug, drug and drug herb interactions
could play a role in incorporating
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis into their regimen, which I think
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pharmacists can play a role,
you know, from the dispensary side on this
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also in like the pharmacy,
you know, conventional pharmacy setting as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is such a key place
where pharmacists could mitigate so much
[SPEAKER_01]: risk or potential risk for people
interested in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that this is, you know,
because this is not amazing in most
[SPEAKER_01]: places, this is why a lot of people try
one CBD product or one cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden are just like,
nope, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to look at it ever again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of write it off because,
you know, for example, maybe they picked
[SPEAKER_01]: up a CBD oil that's supposed to be taken
under your tongue, but they put it on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of their tongue or they just threw it in a
smoothie and didn't feel any difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, it's so much of this is yes,
based on education, but also just the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that there really needs to be more
widespread discussion about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I think that model of having a
pharmacist available in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in kind of building off that point
about people maybe not knowing how to
[SPEAKER_00]: properly use the product, how difficult is
it to that of finding the right dose for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and then finding good product
consistency as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is this is so key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you might have heard before is
people say start low, go slow,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that, you know, which I definitely
agree with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also like to add at the end,
stay low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that people maybe think
that, you know, just like a prescription,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you go up, it will work better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be true for some people,
but it might not necessarily be true for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that everyone has to find their
sweet spot and their perfect milligram and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd be surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people it might be really low for
people who are users every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for some people, it might be
really high who are also users every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really depends the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a bit of the struggle
in the dosing world for cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not dependent on race or
gender or to an extent, it's dependent on
[SPEAKER_01]: body composition, but not really at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just really depends on the person
and their trial and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that that's why health care
professionals being involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion is so important, because if
there is someone in your corner guiding
[SPEAKER_01]: you and helping you with saying,
OK, maybe you start with a quarter dropper
[SPEAKER_01]: of your CBD oil the first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you take that for a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see how you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always think it's really important to
keep like a CBD or cannabis journal so
[SPEAKER_01]: that once you're taking certain doses,
then you can write it down and.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can evaluate and see,
OK, how did this make me feel that this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, was this enough to make me feel
how I want to feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, you can, you know,
continually titrate the dose up if you
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like that's appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, one of the things I love about
natural products and cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular is that so many formulations
allow for this sense of patient
[SPEAKER_01]: empowerment in their own treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're able to take as much as they
feel like they need that day after going
[SPEAKER_01]: through the titration process of like,
OK, maybe this is not the right dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me take a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe some days you wake up and you're
like, I need that like extra 10 milligrams
[SPEAKER_01]: to make me ready for the day or to help
focus just a little bit more today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, I I definitely think
that that's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, coming back to this whole
lack of training or maybe lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge among health care professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, were you taught anything
about the endocannabinoid system in your
[SPEAKER_00]: in your training?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that trend changing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are our medical schools beginning to offer
more courses on the ECS?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, OK, so when I was in school,
there was absolutely nothing in my
[SPEAKER_01]: curriculum about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, it was like looking back on
it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, wow, what a what a lost
opportunity to be able to speak to
[SPEAKER_01]: students and even like new practitioners
about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was in school, no, granted,
that was a while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I see that trend changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even, for example, today, I'm speaking
at a pharmacy school about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and it's a lot of what I do now is I I
lecture quite often, whether it's to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a student group like I lecture
quite often at University of Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I live between L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I lecture there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of lecturing during Covid
went remote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had a chance to speak at a lot of
other universities like today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm speaking at a university in Ohio,
but it's, of course, virtual.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really opened up a lot more
opportunity as well to realize that,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, you know, we can bring in all these
experts, but we don't need to necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: fly them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have them over webinars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see more and more schools interested
and more and more schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it's not just on cannabis,
on like the idea of like integrative
[SPEAKER_01]: health and integrative wellness,
which I think is really important because
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plays an amazing role in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not everything when it comes to
integrative health, like there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: other aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this feeds into this topic
that I love to have in the medics of all
[SPEAKER_01]: these like other potential substances and
activities that can influence our
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system that are not just,
you know, simply like based on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of other things we do in our
daily life, for example, that we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: even think about that is actually
influencing our endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: system every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite examples is exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is another one of my like
favorite myths to bust is that when
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's talking about like the
endorphin high after working out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this came out like decades ago,
but there were a few researchers looking
[SPEAKER_01]: into the different neurotransmitters,
different neurochemicals that are impacted
[SPEAKER_01]: with working out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they found that, yes, like all the
way down the biochemical cascade that
[SPEAKER_01]: endorphins did increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that really caught on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now everyone really talks about
working out as, you know, like the direct
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit, or rather one of the direct
benefits of working out is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this feeling of endorphins and this like
runner's high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, if you look, you know,
earlier in the cascade, a lot of it has to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with the release of anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anandamide is an endocannabinoid that
we, you know, synthesize on demand in our
[SPEAKER_01]: body that interacts with the
endocannabinoid system, and in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: with CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this receptor is the same receptor
that, you know, is, you know, mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with the central nervous system
function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, like in the spinal cord in the
brain, and also the one that THC binds
[SPEAKER_01]: with and has a very high affinity with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if anandamide is also
binding to the CB1 receptor, it would make
[SPEAKER_01]: sense that we get these feelings of
euphoria and this feeling of almost being
[SPEAKER_01]: high from working out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's like one of my favorite
examples is that cannabinoid medics are
[SPEAKER_01]: all around us and in things that we do all
the time, but we just don't think about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another, you know, another way
that it plays a role really is in like
[SPEAKER_01]: spices and in the way that we cook,
whether it's eating at home or eating out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, beta-karyophylline is a
terpene that is found in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally occurring, found in a lot of
different plants and spices, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, black pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so beta-karyophylline has been shown
that it has an affinity to the CB2
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really interesting because
growing up, my mom would make,
[SPEAKER_01]: every time I didn't feel well,
she would make, you know, this like lentil
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of porridge and it was lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she would always put a lot of black
pepper in it because it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that she always had growing up,
something that she continued to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, you know, black pepper will
help you and help bolster your immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system kind of a thing and something that
I had always heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now learning about the
endocannabinoid system and how so many
[SPEAKER_01]: things impact it, whether directly or
indirectly, knowing that
[SPEAKER_01]: beta-karyophylline is an active component
and that it interacts with the CB2
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor that's most closely associated
with immune function and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: optimizing immune function.
[SPEAKER_01]: It completely makes sense, but almost from
like a scientific standpoint versus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, something I've heard so many
times growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then looking more into herbs and
things like black pepper, it's not just
[SPEAKER_01]: that it also interacts with, of course,
a lot of other systems and things,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's incredible to think that without
even knowing it and without even
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily incorporating cannabinoids or
cannabis into our daily life, we're
[SPEAKER_01]: already improving what's called our
endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really that is just the overall
functionality of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system and how important that is because
there's this new phenomenon that some
[SPEAKER_01]: people are just born with what's called
endocannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just the meaning that,
you know, your endocannabinoid system is
[SPEAKER_01]: not working at its, you know, highest,
most optimal function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just thinking like, okay,
how can I optimize my system?
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe for whatever reason,
if someone's on warfarin or on other drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: where maybe incorporating cannabis is not
the safest choice for them, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of other things they can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so coming from an integrative
perspective, love to talk about how we can
[SPEAKER_01]: make our endocannabinoid system work best
from a cannabinoid perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also from like a non-cannabinoid
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought up cannabimimetics
because I saw that you had spoken about
[SPEAKER_00]: that at the Cannabis Science Conference
and that was a new word for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't heard it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really interesting and I'm glad
you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that you brought up that
anandamide is actually the compound that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you the runner's high or the
euphoria after you work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a t-shirt made up that's
just the chemical structure of anandamide
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wear to the gym.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one knows what it means, but I know
what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just for me anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but you mentioned that with the
cannabimimetics, there are ways to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: improve our endocannabinoid tone,
whether it be through exercise or things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious about the opposite though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there certain maybe medications or
lifestyle choices that people make that
[SPEAKER_00]: can negatively affect their
endocannabinoid tone that we should really
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anyone's ever really asked
me this in this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we think about the goal of the
overall endocannabinoid system really is
[SPEAKER_01]: balance and homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the endocannabinoid system is able to
synthesize these endocannabinoids on
[SPEAKER_01]: demand whenever it senses that things
might be out of balance in our overall
[SPEAKER_01]: body system or in like particular organ
systems or neurotransmitter systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tries to do what it can to rectify
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What really can get in the way is an
excess of unwanted inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of what homeostasis has to do
with is really regulating the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is also something that I've
started talking about a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: recently, but this term anti-inflammatory
and I see it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just so important to note that
our body does need a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammatory response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our body does need what I like to call a
healthy response to inflammation because
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's pollutants or other foreign
substances, things that we don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: enter our body or that shouldn't be there,
then we do want a way for our body to
[SPEAKER_01]: react.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our immune system to fight it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't want an anti-inflammatory
effect, but cannabinoids as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system really help to
optimize our inflammatory response and
[SPEAKER_01]: really make it healthy and the best it can
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of what gets in the way of
increasing or improving endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: tone and a lot of what has to do with
endocannabinoid deficiency has to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: this increased inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really interesting now,
because a lot of research is coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about chronic disease states,
like whether they're cardiovascular
[SPEAKER_01]: disease, like heart disease or pulmonary
disease, or even things like anxiety and
[SPEAKER_01]: depression and all of these things really
having... Oh, as well as diabetes has been
[SPEAKER_01]: another big one about all these kind of
chronic disease states that we all deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with them, that so many of us rather deal
with on the daily, that the root of a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of these is inflammation and this unwanted
excess of inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we can work with our
endocannabinoid system to help improve
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid tone, then this would
really help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also stress has a lot to do with
inflammation and what type of stress we
[SPEAKER_01]: have in our life, whether that's inner
stress, or external stressors,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could be a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's another thing that I love to
talk about too is the role of adaptogens
[SPEAKER_01]: in our life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And adaptogens are herb substances,
activities that can really help improve
[SPEAKER_01]: our body's response to stress and overall
stressors, whether that's external or
[SPEAKER_01]: internal stressors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that comes back to the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all comes back to the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Swathi, so winding down here
before I let you go, I did wanna give you
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity to plug any social media
