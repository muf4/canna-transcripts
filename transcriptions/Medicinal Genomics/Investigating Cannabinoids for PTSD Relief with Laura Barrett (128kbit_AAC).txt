[SPEAKER_03]: good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our guest today is Laura Barrett.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nurse Laura is the Founder and Executive
Director of the National Clinical Director
[SPEAKER_03]: Consortium.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is the owner and operator of Ask Nurse
Laura, and she's on the board of multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: nonprofits, including the Connor Sheffield
Foundation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura has worked in each of the
plant-touching cannabis fields from
[SPEAKER_03]: growing, processing, and opening
dispensaries, as well as sales,
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing, and compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura works with providers, patients,
caregivers, cannabis businesses,
[SPEAKER_03]: and traditional workplaces to educate,
inform, and collaborate to find the best
[SPEAKER_03]: options for improving quality of life in a
safe, reliable manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura is currently working with the Connor
Sheffield Foundation on an observational
[SPEAKER_03]: research study about the use of cannabis
to treat symptoms of post-traumatic stress
[SPEAKER_03]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_03]: During our conversation, we discuss how
cannabinoids affect trauma responses and
[SPEAKER_03]: support cognitive therapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Details about the research study including
who should participate and how data will
[SPEAKER_03]: be collected, how patients use different
routes of administration, cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: ratios, and dosages to manage certain
symptoms of PTSD, the challenges of doing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid research, and the need for
standardization across the US,
[SPEAKER_03]: and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to my conversation with
Laura, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_03]: sponsor, McKinney RSA.
[SPEAKER_03]: McKinney is made up of regulatory science
veterans who apply lessons learned in the
[SPEAKER_03]: nicotine space to help cannabis
manufacturers better understand the
[SPEAKER_03]: toxological and societal implications of
their products.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do that by identifying base
compounds, extracts, flavors, and
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes, understanding how they interact,
and ensuring effectiveness for the
[SPEAKER_03]: intended use.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also provide dosing recommendations
and assessments to establish guidelines
[SPEAKER_03]: for product consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn more at McKinneyRSA.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Laura
[SPEAKER_03]: Barrett.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning, Laura.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to talk with you today about a
study that you're doing to better
[SPEAKER_03]: understand how cannabis can be used to
treat PTSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oddly enough, I did a quick search of our
CanMed archive on the website where we
[SPEAKER_03]: have all the recordings of all the
different CanMed presentations over the
[SPEAKER_03]: years, and I was surprised I didn't find
one about PTSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think that over the years that
we've been doing this that there would be
[SPEAKER_03]: one, but that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe that'll change in 2025.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our abstract portal is open, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until November 15th, so if you or anyone
else who's studying PTSD would like to
[SPEAKER_03]: submit one, that would be great to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, back to why you're here,
I was wondering if you could provide an
[SPEAKER_03]: overview of the study, kind of what are
the primary objectives, and what got you
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in exploring PTSD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so thank you for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such an important question,
and I just want to say that so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people, I believe, have symptoms of PTSD,
and they don't even know what PTSD is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't attribute what
they're feeling to this post-traumatic
[SPEAKER_00]: stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often, I think it's kind of like
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: We over-utilize the term PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's PTSD, or it's bipolar,
or oh, it's depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it officially diagnosed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even imposter syndrome, I find myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just responded to a friend on LinkedIn,
and I said, imposter-like symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than saying imposter syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think PTSD is the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we, so this is not just me,
this is a nonprofit called the Connor
[SPEAKER_00]: Sheffield Foundation, based out of
Baltimore County in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came together a couple of years
ago, established the foundation,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the person, Connor Sheffield,
and his need as a young person for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and cannabinoid medicine,
because it's the only thing that helped
[SPEAKER_00]: him thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a failure to thrive, couldn't gain
weight, pediatric, stomach motility
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder, very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing that worked were
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, mostly some cannabidiol,
but eventually even some THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's in his early 20s and thriving
and still really relies on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the family, and then a bunch of
volunteers came together to establish this
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation to raise money to do research
on cannabinoids, because we don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tricky, as many of my peers in
cannabis therapeutics and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, and you guys have spoken about,
it's really tricky to do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at first, we were really hoping that my
friends at Hopkins would do a research
[SPEAKER_00]: project with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think eventually we will do some
collaboration with them at some point,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's so time consuming to get an
academic research project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the scheduling of cannabis at
this time is really challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went through an independent,
with an IRB process, since it's on people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And came up with just doing a smaller
study first, an observational study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a controlled trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not providing the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just asking people that have
symptoms or diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't actually have to have had a
doctor say, you have post-traumatic stress
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have symptoms of
post-traumatic stress, which could be
[SPEAKER_00]: fear, anxiety, sleeplessness, outbursts,
triggers to an experience that brings you
[SPEAKER_00]: back to vivid memories of something that
happened in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some people, which I think we
don't talk about this enough, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the person that our organization is
founded off of struggles with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have medical post-traumatic
stress disorder, like having had a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis and struggling with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you had a heart attack or if you
had a stroke and you were covered,
[SPEAKER_00]: the challenge of not being afraid that
that's going to happen again, because in
[SPEAKER_00]: some cases it may.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are people who are even
challenged just by getting their checkups,
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the doctor, waiting for that lab
result, waiting for that next mammogram
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people have symptoms of
this post-traumatic stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to include anyone that has
symptoms like that diagnosed or
[SPEAKER_00]: undiagnosed that is considering or has
been using cannabinoid medicine purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: from a legal dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, they do not have to be in a
state where they have an adult use program
[SPEAKER_00]: or necessarily a medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have to have legally licensed
dispensaries because we want it to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: label and hopefully be lab tested,
which honestly not every state even
[SPEAKER_00]: requires all of the lab testing,
but we'd like a label.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like it to be purchased legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just observational data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing three surveys and mostly
yes or no questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not expecting to take a lot of time
out of someone's life, out of their day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 days, 60 days and six months,
30 days, 90 days and six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a, I think about 20
questions survey, mostly yes or no
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to establish which
cannabinoids are people using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there are a couple, there isn't a
lot of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know it's challenging with
research, but this is such a varied
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis or varied amount of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times we're looking at fear
and anxiety and how that's related and
[SPEAKER_00]: treating that symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that help relate to resolving
or dealing with the post-traumatic stress
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: But should I just keep going?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is, I want to give credit to a
more recent study out of Wayne State
[SPEAKER_00]: University in Detroit, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give these folks some credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did cannabinoid modulation of brain
activation during volitional regulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: negative affect in trauma exposed adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially they were looking to see if
they gave some cannabis and they give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you respond?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, we knew you had a history of
trauma and it's really good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what they meant essentially we're
looking at is this emotional dysregulation
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is the, that one of the main
things that happens with post-traumatic
[SPEAKER_00]: stress disorder is you, the person you has
trouble recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not like some people,
like you could see a bear and think,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, do I run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I freeze?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then think about it and move on,
hopefully get away from the bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But someone that is has post-traumatic
stress disorder can't like loses their
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to function and would go to an
extreme of extreme fear or extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: physical reaction or extreme depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like something that then takes days,
you know, it took us a lot of time to move
[SPEAKER_00]: out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they looked at this and they did
find that as we, might expect and
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipate, and I've seen in some of my
patients that when people use,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really is the THC, not so much CBD a
little bit, but really the THC really does
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to help people work through therapy,
like cognitive behavioral therapy work
[SPEAKER_00]: through it better than not having it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in their study, they used,
you know, they did both because this
[SPEAKER_00]: actually was like a trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have patients who were using
cannabis and patients who weren't,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they found that it did increase the
cerebellar activation when they saw these
[SPEAKER_00]: images and they had less negative side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great little study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll share the link so that people can see
it, but I was pleased to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal really is just to have a
better idea of which routes of
[SPEAKER_00]: administration people are using and which
ratio of cannabis, if they're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some of the few studies,
maybe in the past couple of years where
[SPEAKER_00]: they have looked at cannabis, at THC in
particular, they've been, if it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: oral, either synthetic or you know,
in a natural form, it's been a lowish dose
[SPEAKER_00]: between five to 10 milligrams,
7.5 milligrams seems to be the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's been like a lot of inhaled
cannabis, which is really hard to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially as a nurse, like my goal
isn't for people to need to just smoke all
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's not really the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to be able to find some
baseline, like, oh, if you take a four to
[SPEAKER_00]: one tablet, so four times the THC to one
time CBD in this low dose twice a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe it'll keep your symptoms at bay
so that you can be functional at work and
[SPEAKER_00]: functional taking care of your grandkids
and functional just to feel good in your
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potentially to use some of these
cannabinoids to do the regular more
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional psychological therapy,
like cognitive behavioral therapy to
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially heal from, recover from some
of these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some amazing veteran patients,
you know, cause that's a big population
[SPEAKER_00]: that is known to suffer from
post-traumatic stress disorder and using
[SPEAKER_00]: some THC, again, in the right amount,
let's be kind of figure out what that
[SPEAKER_00]: right amount is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had stories from patients who
weren't able to sleep in bed at night with
[SPEAKER_00]: their spouse because of nightmares and
outbursts and a fear of injuring their
[SPEAKER_00]: spouse in the middle of the night or just
scaring them even from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been able to, again,
not medical advice, but with encouragement
[SPEAKER_00]: and education, have some of these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some amazing stories, like I can
sleep in bed with my spouse now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have to sleep in another room,
sometimes even with a locked door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've heard some really extreme
situations and that sleep piece and
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressing the REM sleep, which is the
dream sleep, which is a lot of times where
[SPEAKER_00]: the nightmares occur seems to be really
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have so many peers that are more
experts than I am in some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: individual fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a nurse, just trying to bring that
holistic picture together, the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: person and looking at how do we make them
the most productive in the daytime,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best rested at night to be their best
version of themselves is really the goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mentioned that the THC is helpful
because it sort of suppresses the REM
[SPEAKER_03]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's actually kind of blocking them
from getting into REM sleep and having
[SPEAKER_03]: those dreams that can trigger the trauma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's my understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a short time, which I needed
to rely on some of my expert peers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, you know, we always have more to
learn and we need more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a short time where I was
concerned that so many patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: people, consumers, users were using THC
for sleep and maybe not getting enough
[SPEAKER_00]: quality sleep because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to look at each individual
person and look at if you sleep well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're not using cannabis at nighttime
and you sleep well, my recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: education is don't start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't need to, why would you do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: However, many people use things like
alcohol because they think alcohol helps
[SPEAKER_00]: them fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it does help them fall asleep,
but it really doesn't give us quality
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that for a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for many people, cannabis can give them
THC in particular, can give them better
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep than the sleep that they are
getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at those individual things and
figure out maybe it is inhaled cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few hours before bed that helps
them fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The falling asleep is their issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it is some type of edible
capsule, something that's going to last
[SPEAKER_00]: longer in even some cases, an extracted
oil like RSO that will give them a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: to help them stay asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically if they have pain or
post-traumatic stress disorder,
[SPEAKER_00]: nightmares, other things, maybe even
women's issues like menopausal symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: hot flashes might be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this whole episode isn't to
talk about sleep and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, post-traumatic stress disorder,
a lot of people experience those symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: during the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have it just trying to fall
asleep when all of a sudden all the noise
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world gets quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then suddenly all the anxiety and fear
and the racing thoughts come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis THC in particular helps
to break those racing thoughts,
[SPEAKER_00]: stop that in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're looking to gather our minimum
is 300 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep telling everybody I want a
thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really have no limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very short amount of time,
yes or no questions, only three surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just hope that people will consider
it's all through the Tetragram app,
[SPEAKER_00]: which if your viewers, if our viewers
don't already know, I want to give a plug
[SPEAKER_00]: to Tetragram the app because it's a
beautiful free app that consumers can use
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can track like journal your
cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can in some cases scan the barcode on
the product and have all the data pull in
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physicians and providers can have groups
of patients and kind of share information
[SPEAKER_00]: and track through groups like different
types of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using that app to collect the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like on your phone or on your iPad
or computer, really quick for somebody to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more people we have, the more
we'll be able to have a better analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: what does seem to work best for most
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be over 21 and purchasing
again from a legal dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, so you mentioned using the app and
being able to journal and track your usage
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that you also mentioned there's
sort of three different surveys at
[SPEAKER_03]: different time points, but are you also
kind of collecting data kind of in between
[SPEAKER_03]: those points as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: If people are, are journaling and tracking
things in the app?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the app, anytime anyone logs
anything like that data will be there and
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they have the option, you know,
opt in or opt out of certain things,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that we keep privacy,
but we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lots of points in the app that we
can collect even as some simple as like
[SPEAKER_00]: age, which is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know, you know, are these
younger people dealing with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they older people and the specific
symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the option to say,
I'm using cannabis to manage PTSD
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms, but then more specifically,
which symptoms are you having?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, some people have more
outbursts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have more social anxiety
disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just, it just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have insomnia and they're not
sleeping because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is it preventing you from
working like those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also can even track like by
the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see, you know, which states and
which products people are using in which
[SPEAKER_00]: states give us an idea of where we need to
encourage more development of newer
[SPEAKER_00]: process products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause again, in some cases people are
inhaling in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower and strains, which can be
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can track in the app,
like different terpenes and the ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also need to look at,
is it, is it better in a more edible form
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it anyone using a topical?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it, does a topical help someone that
is being triggered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if they put a topical rub on their
neck, you know, or, or do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: self massage to, to release and do some
breathing, does that relieve their
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could all the different ways
that you could support your
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system could help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be interesting to see that,
that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need people to sign up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put a link right in the show
description so people can easily get to it
[SPEAKER_03]: and either participate or share it with
someone who they know that they're a good
[SPEAKER_03]: fit for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I was, I was curious,
how are people using cannabis kind of to
[SPEAKER_03]: treat their symptoms?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it sort of like a preventative thing or
like a kind of daily usage just to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: keep symptoms at bay or do they actually
use it in an acute situation where,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you said, having a panic attack or
having an episode ingesting cannabis to
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of get back to baseline?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, for the, the research
study, we just started collecting patients
[SPEAKER_00]: in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still in the data collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, we don't even have any data
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still in the patient recruitment
part of that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we get all the patients and
we sort of close off, which I think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing January 1st, then we're going to do,
we have that like six months is the
[SPEAKER_00]: survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my practice, so I am independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work as a consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a registered nurse and I coach people
and work with people alongside of their
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor as a bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my favorite thing to say about nursing
and cannabis is, well, holistic and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine overall is, is we are the bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the bridge between the provider and
the dispensary for the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the bridge between like traditional
medicine and holistic and integrative
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm writing a book, nurses are the bridge
coming soon, hopefully by Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as that nurse coach, nurse educator in
my practice with patients, I have many
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have suffered from like sexual
trauma, domestic violence, and many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are women.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them have like an overwhelming
sense of doom every day and that there
[SPEAKER_00]: really aren't a good group of,
or a good protocol for prescription
[SPEAKER_00]: medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm a plant medicine nurse,
but I'm very much also for integrating
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't have a lot of traditional
pharmaceuticals that work or that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to take so many or the side effects are so
much that, that can relieve the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have people getting back to your
question that take a low dose of just
[SPEAKER_00]: something routinely, which we have some
pretty good data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of our friends that are very
involved with CanMed and medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics would share that, you know,
one-to-one equal amounts of CBD and THC
[SPEAKER_00]: have, have been known in low doses to be
helpful for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do have some people that,
that utilize those types of routes of
[SPEAKER_00]: administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting more data, more research
recently about another cannabinoid CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: being really helpful also for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, depending on when their
symptoms are worse generally, so if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not that they just wake up every day with
that impending doom and need something,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it is more about being in the world and
being triggered, like potentially somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: that was in a traumatic car accident might
have anxiety just every time they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: get in the car and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to encourage people to
smoke a little bit before they get in the
[SPEAKER_00]: car and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be thoughtful, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, we definitely would be
considering a less intoxicating route,
[SPEAKER_00]: less cannabinoid and less intoxicating
route.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want people to be safe on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it is that they're going to be home
or they're in an environment where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not the driver, then potentially if they
are triggered having an inhalation option
[SPEAKER_00]: available, whether that is inhaling,
like a lot of times, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell people with post-traumatic stress
disorder and like panic attacks related to
[SPEAKER_00]: it to consider carrying a vape pen like
it's an EpiPen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have it on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have, again, in a legal state
where you legally can use it, have it
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just knowing you have it might help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not even need to use it,
but it's easier and more accessible than
[SPEAKER_00]: having to actually light something and
smoke it in environments where with the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of our country, we still not be able
to do that everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have had experience with multiple
patients where just having it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: purse, on their person, just knowing they
have it has been enough for their brain to
[SPEAKER_00]: release the sympathetic nervous system,
get back to a more natural response and
[SPEAKER_00]: feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And or they can take a puff or two and
immediately have some relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm interested to see the survey
responses because I think it can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: for like that in the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we would be looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal for most people is hopefully to
prevent having to even get to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: having to prevent those feelings,
because when our body is releasing all
[SPEAKER_00]: that cortisol and going through that that
triggered response, it's unhealthy for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would prefer it if we could just keep
the edge off that and utilize the tools of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine, plant medicine,
and maybe entheogenic medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: some psychedelics to do the work,
do the therapy, retrain our brain to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: a new response.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing I wanted to ask you about is
is dosage and probably kind of a corollary
[SPEAKER_03]: to that as well would be sort of the the
ratio of the cannabinoids to I'm just
[SPEAKER_03]: speaking from personal experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that you talked about
was sort of like trying to sleep,
[SPEAKER_03]: having racing thoughts and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually had issues with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have too much THC or if it's not the
right strain for me, I can't fall asleep
[SPEAKER_03]: because I have those racing thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't stop them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I imagine with someone who struggles
with that, with PTSD, finding the right
[SPEAKER_03]: ratio at the right dosage is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, you know, it's so
interesting to think about how many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries across the country sell
gummies that are 10 milligrams as like the
[SPEAKER_00]: starting dose and milligrams of THC
starting dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody walks in, we have all of these
seniors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they like to be called something
else now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wise people over 65 who, you know,
they smoked in college or they smoked way
[SPEAKER_00]: back when.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now we have it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go to a dispensary and they're
like, yeah, I want to take a gummy to
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbor does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get this 10 milligram gummy and
they take it and maybe even they take half
[SPEAKER_00]: to start because somebody maybe told them
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they feel nothing an hour later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they take the other half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for many people, instead of
falling asleep, they start to feel a
[SPEAKER_00]: little paranoid or anxious or their hearts
racing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thankfully, it's not going to hurt
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, it doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal is to help people feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think at the dispensaries,
the people that are working at the
[SPEAKER_00]: counter, they want people to feel good,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they have their
endocannabinoid system is primed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know they're ready and they don't
always think about when someone says,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, yeah, I've used cannabis before
because they're at the counter trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: be cool and feeling intimidated by the
young person standing behind the counter
[SPEAKER_00]: and the store itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, I recommend super low THC
doses with higher CBD at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just not even getting into like
all of the CBD and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much to just try to give a quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, CBD cannabidiol is
very available from hemp and from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our study, you have to be purchasing
from a cannabis dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, higher CBD, generally like 25%
milligrams and up with just a tiny bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 2.5 milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I have to say this because I
have a nursing license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not medical advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just education, something for you
to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can be a good starting place
that the cannabidiol can really be helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: for relaxation and reducing anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's good for anxiety and
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some connections between
anxiety and inflammation, interestingly
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, too, which is why some of the
other cannabinoids and gut brain health
[SPEAKER_00]: are worth considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually I'll encourage people to start
with that and try that for at least four
[SPEAKER_00]: days, but potentially a couple of weeks
and just see, are we getting any benefit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we work our way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, some people end up at 10
milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe if you take lower doses,
cannabidiol is biphasic, meaning at one
[SPEAKER_00]: dose it does one thing and another dose it
does another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lower doses can also like make you
want to stay up and read a book all night,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it might not feel anxious,
but you're also not sleeping or make you
[SPEAKER_00]: too creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to understand some of
that dynamic and just do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: homework on that or talk to somebody like
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some people, they might end up
going towards mostly all THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people with a lot of pain,
again, it all depends on the person and
[SPEAKER_00]: what is keeping them awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's racing thoughts, that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's pain, I mean, some people do take
a 40 milligram gummy, which they sell in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the medical markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: For bedtime, because they have that much
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're taking that instead of taking a
bunch of opioids at bedtime and benzos and
[SPEAKER_00]: all these other medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that keeps the pain at bay and also
helps them sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is important to start low and go
slow and see how your body responds and
[SPEAKER_00]: give your body time to respond.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason we keep saying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think one of the things that you
mentioned before about the value of the
[SPEAKER_03]: study that you're doing is to try to
identify what are those good ratios and
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure that they're available to people
in other states, because I know that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: the case everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might not have sort of that high CBD,
low THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in some states, it's just all THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're lucky if you find any CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that would be a great benefit
of this work is to really figure out what
[SPEAKER_03]: that good ratio is and inform the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things I'm really
grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm independent, I'm not full time
employed by anybody, just me, Ask Nurse
[SPEAKER_00]: Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that I get to work because with
nursing, I can work in other states and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to companies and talk to researchers
about the different products, also in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp space and what's out there that we're
seeing is beneficial and where are those
[SPEAKER_00]: gaps, what's missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to educate people on how to be a smart
hemp consumer even, like how to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable hemp company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully in our network, we have some
good people that have some good products,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there also is a lot of garbage out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a secret shopper campaign in the
state of Delaware for hemp shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of scary what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot because it's not so
regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to encourage people to do
their homework and learn how to dig into
[SPEAKER_00]: the details, not just trust, like Google
reviews and not just trust a handshake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know what we're getting,
what we're putting in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even if today it doesn't cause a
negative effect, some of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be in some of these products might
cause issues down the road that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that could be a whole other podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, I think we should do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one of the things I was going
to ask, but then I remembered that the
[SPEAKER_03]: study is restricted to getting products
from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was curious, are people using
hemp-derived cannabinoids or these
[SPEAKER_03]: synthetic cannabinoids like Delta-8-THC or
some of these other things for PTSD?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be interesting,
maybe a later study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe you don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're trying to get approved by
an IRB, it is an independent review board.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of specifics that you
have to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our first study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to do so many more research
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to do something to get off
the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to find ways to sort of
level the playing field just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a group called CANRA,
the Cannabis Regulators Association,
[SPEAKER_00]: that brings together cannabis regulators
from multiple states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they talk and hopefully, at some
point, we're going to have some more
[SPEAKER_00]: standard across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the challenges that I find
is standards from state to state,
[SPEAKER_00]: accessibility from state to state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to take the time to figure out what
the regulations are, what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: standards in this state, especially for
business owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a contract with Brightview
Assisted Living because they want their
[SPEAKER_00]: residents to be able to access cannabis
and utilize cannabis in their facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these people, this is the end of
their life is going to be in this
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want them to have a good quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They operate in eight states up and down
the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the states, they all have
medical programs, but they have different
[SPEAKER_00]: rules and different products in each of
their programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to standardize a policy and
standardize implementation for them is
[SPEAKER_00]: really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We deal with that, medicinal genomics,
making the testing kits for all the
[SPEAKER_03]: different states and trying to figure out
what needs to be tested in each of the
[SPEAKER_03]: different states.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a tool on our website that tries
to make sense of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's a full-time job.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our regulatory affairs team.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's their job, is to stay on top of all
the different changing regulations and
[SPEAKER_03]: inform our R&D about the different tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a hodgepodge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're all dealing with it at
different levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would love some standardization.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would really help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting, too, because it's in
the cannabinoids, in the dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also that the hemp is just... And
again, I'm a huge fan of hemp-derived
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you have to know the company
and really dig into where the hemp is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it's processed, what it's processed
with, who's testing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really a third party?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really every batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just because at least shopping in a
dispensary, depending on the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what the standards are that they
have to uphold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm lucky to have started my journey
in health care and cannabis medicine in
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland that has some really strict
regulations around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually opened a grow facility in a
processing lab in three dispensaries when
[SPEAKER_00]: I first came in about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really was deep into the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the person with the lab coming to do
our samples and reading the report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some personal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even that is kind of interesting,
because if they're testing it on day seven
[SPEAKER_00]: or day 10 of its curing, there are
different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how much do we get to reprocess and
retest?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just, yeah, that's a whole
big question and concern for health care
[SPEAKER_00]: providers, because I think that's part of
the reason that physicians feel so
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable prescribing prescriptions,
giving out prescriptions, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: have gone through all these very specific,
very regulated, very precise things to be
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a plant, it's more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with different rules and regulations
in every state, it's just much more
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need nurses to be the bridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need you to come to CanMed and get
educated and meet some great people too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Laura, thanks so much for doing
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I let you go, I just want to give
you an opportunity to either plug the
[SPEAKER_03]: study more or other resources that people
can view if they're interested in learning
[SPEAKER_03]: more about this, and then other ways that
they can get in contact with you and learn
[SPEAKER_03]: about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say I mentioned the Connor
Sheffield Foundation, and I'm sure we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: put links for that in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just the face here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Renee Rinslinger is our chief investigator
and then the whole team.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Connor Sheffield family, Otha from
Tetragram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Shanitha and quite a few other
people that are working with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to make sure maybe I'll
give you a list of everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love for everyone to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just happen to be the nurse that's here
talking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I really hope that people will
sign up for our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a QR code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not that difficult,
not that time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have my independent practice,
which is Ask Nurse Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on all social media at Ask
Nurse Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a group called the National
Clinical Director Consortium, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: group of healthcare providers across the
country, nurses, doctors, and pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might even, after the last conference,
I was speaking to some speech therapists
[SPEAKER_00]: and some physical therapists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to be involved because
patients, people are bringing up
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're talking to the people that are
helping them to heal along all different
[SPEAKER_00]: journeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to come together and utilize
each other as resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll put a link to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look that up, see if you're any
type of healthcare provider interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really just meet to sort of support
each other and talk about how we're
[SPEAKER_00]: helping our patients and speak at
conferences and potentially help with some
[SPEAKER_00]: advocacy work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really big goal we've been working on for
years now is like getting cannabis into
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitals and healthcare facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least, don't forget,
I'm writing a book, Coming Soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nurses on the Bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully I'll get that published.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, happy to have you on the podcast and
excited to see you down in Puerto Rico for
[SPEAKER_03]: CanMed 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for having me.
