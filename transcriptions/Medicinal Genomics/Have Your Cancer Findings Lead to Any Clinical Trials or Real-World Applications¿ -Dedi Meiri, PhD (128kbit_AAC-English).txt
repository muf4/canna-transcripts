[SPEAKER_01]: And sort of talking about clinical
applications and maybe, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: future research has any of your findings
led to any clinical trials or real world
[SPEAKER_01]: applications yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, and both questions are the answer
is yes, it's lead to clinical trials and
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to real world applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in three cases, first of all,
I want to take one step back, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: to explain cannabis is a given name to
hundreds of thousands of different chemo
[SPEAKER_00]: bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of them contain different
combination of molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just talk that this combination is
important for the effects, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer is a given name to thousands of
different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have in our body 227 different types of
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each type of cell have different types of
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our, you know, lung cancer, breast cancer,
skin cancer are totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even in one type of cancer,
breast cancer, we have 20 some different
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So altogether, you're talking about
thousands of different chemo bars of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and thousands of different
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now my goal in my lab, what I'm trying
is to match a specific cannabis to a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that cannabis can cure cancer
or cannabis can treat cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are specific types of cannabis or
molecules in the cannabis, they might help
[SPEAKER_00]: or cure specific types of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's first of all, let's bring it
back to earth, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least in three cases, three types
of cancers and mutation, we already know
[SPEAKER_00]: which cannabis which which combination of
molecules can kill this cancer when you
[SPEAKER_00]: have this mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in leukemia with a specific mutation
called NOTCH1 mutation, I already know
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the molecules in the cannabis
that will always kill the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a leukemia patient have a mutation
called NOTCH1 and 50% of the leukemia
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, it's not all the leukemia,
but it's around 60% actually, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this type of cancer will treat as a
chemotherapy or therapy or radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: without all the side effects and
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea it would be the same,
it's killing the cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have three types of cancers like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are in two of them, we started the
process, I opened a company, raise money,
[SPEAKER_00]: we started the process to go to clinical
trials, that's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other hand, we created products
cannabis product extracts or flowers that
[SPEAKER_00]: we aiming the specific patient not to take
a general cannabis to take this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually I'm very gentle on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying if you have leukemia and you
have this type of leukemia and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: already going to take cannabis and you
don't know what you're taking and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't care, why won't you take this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that we have science on that and
research and we know it's not coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient, this will cure you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, if you're taking it arbitrarily
and you don't know what you're taking and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just trial and error, start with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I can think can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are following on the patient
taking, looking the improvement and so and
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are doing it, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's again, phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: A scientist usually like me, even when you
finding something and you have amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: findings in the lab, until a patient will
touch it, it's 10, 15 years, something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did my postdoc in Toronto,
father of one of the PhD student that
[SPEAKER_00]: works with me and she's still a good
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a very important scientist in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the one that invent the Pfizer
COVID-19 vaccination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he won all the prizes in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, he became a billionaire,
but this is a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came to give a talk in my university a
few months ago and he stand and he said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's amazing how we succeed to create a
medical medicine in eight months to this
[SPEAKER_00]: virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now in my talk, I want to show you
that it took 40 years, that it took me 40
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm coming back to what I meant to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually to a scientist in the lab to have
a results and to affect the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he's lucky and if he's amazing and then
got a Nobel Prize, it's 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my field, in my work, sometimes we
finding something and two weeks after,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can already be in, I can already
recommend the patient or help a patient
[SPEAKER_00]: with that because the product is on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to point him to what we found
and think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very unique situation,
very unique feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very, very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying things that I'm not 100%
sure about them when I'm not 100% sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that it will help and not do a damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you know something and you help,
it's really a good feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a unique situation that patients
kind of have access to this medicine early
[SPEAKER_01]: on where that's not typically the case
with other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an access to the medicine before
you prove it's really medicine.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the access before they have the
knowledge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
