[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about quantitative
chemomix that is a novel genomic selection
[SPEAKER_00]: platform which has potential to bring
revolution into cannabis genomics and
[SPEAKER_00]: breed variety faster and cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Chief Science Officer for DST
Bioscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're based in Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are bringing one of the largest center
of excellence for cannabis genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This research center does cannabis
breeding, genome sequencing, SNP
[SPEAKER_00]: genotyping, and the tissue culture clones
will be provided to the growers to have
[SPEAKER_00]: better consistency as well as yield in
their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four divisions in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Destiny Bioscience, Destiny Bioscience
does genomics breeding research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Destiny Healing, which is pre-clinical
research division for cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, taking into consideration human
genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Destiny Innovations, that's research
division for extraction, purification,
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation development to develop new and
innovative formulations, medicines for
[SPEAKER_00]: treating specific disease condition in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Destiny Naturals, that's another division
for developing skin care products using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids to
treat specific skin care conditions as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as date to use innovative products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question comes why we need genomic
selection or why we need these new modern
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that cannabis has been used for
last thousands of years and since last
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred years there had been breeding
efforts to breed cannabis and develop
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we closely look at the history of
cannabis breeding last century,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that the most of the efforts were
done to breed for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently we see some efforts,
we went through thousands of strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: did meta-analysis and I'm happy that
recently there has been some interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: improving the CBD content in cannabis
varieties, but most of the efforts were
[SPEAKER_00]: focused towards the THC-based breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happened because the technology
was not available and the breeders were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, were dependent on just the impact
of cannabis varieties when we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was improvement in yield indoor
because recently the other environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors which are important for cannabis
yields such as CO2 concentration and light
[SPEAKER_00]: and yield, water and nutrients,
so all these aspects were kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized which improved the indoor
yield, but we don't see much improvement
[SPEAKER_00]: in the outdoor yield because of the
environmental factors such as heat stress
[SPEAKER_00]: and disease, all these aspects need
genetic improvement and there has not much
[SPEAKER_00]: work been done in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall we see the century of cannabis
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a big scope to go into details of
minor cannabinoids and understanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics of minor cannabinoids as well as
terpenes to develop better varieties and
[SPEAKER_00]: integrate all these aspects into the
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about genomic selection,
it's very, very important to integrate so
[SPEAKER_00]: many physiological, genetic as well as
chemical components into it together to
[SPEAKER_00]: have that comprehensive breeding program,
have that comprehensive integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted breeding to achieve the goal of
improvement on one side but also keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and consistency in the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the types of genotypes that we
are targeting to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally in the last 30, 40 years we have
talked about this much part of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that I grow and that derives the price and
that derives the profit, but I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's the most important thing that
should be considered is the active
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical ingredient that cannabis
has and that should be the deciding
[SPEAKER_00]: factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of productivity as well as profit
that we get from cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about this integration,
the breeding plant, the phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype and genotype data, so all these
aspects combined together decides the
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated breeding platform that one
should use for the genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about what are the important
contributing traits, then the pre-breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: that should be focused mostly on the
traits such as how we can improve the root
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio, how we can improve the root
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about another important
component that will push the yield forward
[SPEAKER_00]: is photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to improve the photosynthesis ability
is one of the important key factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about yield improvement,
all these sources which are provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbohydrates which are providing sugars
for cannabinoid, terpene, biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the factors combined together to
decide the bud yield where the formula for
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud yield overall we get the resource
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the resources that you provide,
resource use efficiency, how efficient the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is to use these resources to end
into high quality yield as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: change in the bud yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we
[SPEAKER_00]: go into the details of the genomics of bud
yield improvement, there are two factors
[SPEAKER_00]: on one side we can measure, we can see are
the environmental factors we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the stomatal conductance, we talk about
the sunlight that's required and the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that we provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure, we can quantify,
but on the other side that's the complex
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the genomics of the yield where we
have to take into the expression of genes
[SPEAKER_00]: which are important in flower or
reproductive tissue, the genes which are
[SPEAKER_00]: important for meristem maintenance,
the genes which are important for root
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the holy grails in cannabis
research, the root biomass, lateral root
[SPEAKER_00]: development, the genetics and genomics of
it, the genes which are important for all
[SPEAKER_00]: these key traits which define yield in
combination with the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the area that will push the
cannabis breeding as well as genomics
[SPEAKER_00]: forward through the genomic selection
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see there are three chemotypes,
now we see in cannabis breeding mostly TSC
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant intermediate varieties as well as
CBD dominant varieties, but now we see
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are new products coming with
many combination of high TSC, low CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: high CBD, low TSC and Delta 8 TSC,
Delta 10 TSC, so TSCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many, many more products are
coming in market and all these aspects as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as all these cannabinoids need to be
considered when we select target for a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific cannabinoid breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at cannabis plant, it's a very,
very complex plant in genetics on one side
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's diocious and then it's
heterozygous for the fullest expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype and chemotype, but on the other
side when we go into the details of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid biosynthesis, each cannabinoid
is to be considered separately because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a complex combination of many
cannabinoids, many terpenes working
[SPEAKER_00]: together, expressed together to end into a
complex phenotype and chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a simple example, if we talk about the
total cannabinoid, we get a kind of normal
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution because we are talking about
overall cannabinoid content, but if we
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the same trait from a
TSC-inherited point of view and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD-inherited point of view, now there are
two normal distribution curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean to say is when we go into the
individual cannabinoid biosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics of it, it should be considered
separately rather than traditionally it's
[SPEAKER_00]: considered as total cannabinoid that we
are looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the cannabinoid
biosynthesis pathway, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factors, there are acid
synthesis which end up into the final
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid that we can extract from the
plant, but the overall biosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway for each cannabinoid is to be
considered separately when we are talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the genomic selection model.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the distinct bioscience bioinformatics
machine learning platform to establish
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic selection model, we have now
identified most of the genes in flavonoid
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have also identified important
genes in terpene and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis pathway from beginning up to
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the important factors for the
genomic selection, those are to be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also went through genome-wide scanning
and identified the important disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance genes in cannabis genome using
comparative genomics approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was mentioning, so all these key
targeted genes combined together we scan
[SPEAKER_00]: through the cannabis genome, annotated it,
and we have more than 4,000 key genes
[SPEAKER_00]: which are important for genomic selection
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have identified functionally,
identified their annotated functions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we know the location of these genes,
and we are working on developing this
[SPEAKER_00]: first of its kind genomic selection panel,
including the mathematical modeling that's
[SPEAKER_00]: required for the genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: As this interesting graph shows,
so we have annotated genome with a
[SPEAKER_00]: pangenomics approach, we have key genes
important for cannabinoid biosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have key genes important for terpene
biosynthesis, we have key genes important
[SPEAKER_00]: for flavonoid biosynthesis, their
location, and as you can see in another
[SPEAKER_00]: graph, the other key traits such as
flowering time genes, we have annotated
[SPEAKER_00]: all the genes and identified the SNPs in
these genes which will enable us to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop mathematical models as well as the
panel for genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resources that require for genomic
selections needs the understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: bioinformatics pipelines, using them
effectively to annotate genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: develop SNP panels, but the real question
is why should we do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the importance of using genomic
selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it really helps in terms of taking
a whole genome approach at the sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: level and helps to access or helps to get
back the missing heritability that we
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot get when we are doing
phenotype-based breeding or when we are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing marker-assisted selection-based
breeding where the major genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: considered in terms of QTLs, but when we
do genomic selection, when we use this
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, even the minor alleles or minor
genes with smaller additive effects are
[SPEAKER_00]: considered and this is one of the best
methods that's the gold standard for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis breeding, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other important aspect when we
talk about genomic selection, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: there are multiple traits and we cannot
consider each trait independently,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to consider all these traits in
contributing traits together because in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end we have to bring all these traits
through breeding and genetics-based
[SPEAKER_00]: selection into the variety that we want to
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where the quantitative traits
are important for which the prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: models are built and the correlation
coefficients to be added into all the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative traits, all the qualitative
traits, all the aggressive economic
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, which are important for the yield
as well as biotic and abiotic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about combination of these
traits, then again when we decide a
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted breeding approach, the models,
the genetics, and the combination of the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and genes, we use changes depending
on the targeted traits that is to be
[SPEAKER_00]: achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key important aspect depends,
the key important aspect which decides the
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation between what is the predicted
phenotype and what is the expected
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype depends on how big your
population size is, it depends on the
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability of the trait, how many genes
are, how many QTLs are controlling that
[SPEAKER_00]: trait, defines the success of genomic
selection on individual basis as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: on the combination basis together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other important aspect when we talk
about the genomic selection and the real
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage we get from genomic selection is
we can predict the phenotype just based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it brings revolution into
breeding because we can discard so many,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can negate so many clones predicted
from the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is enabled when we build robust
enough data sets of phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype, and genotype together which are
able to predict the phenotype of the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation when you use this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the predicted selection
index goes on better as you combine traits
[SPEAKER_00]: and as you bring them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the three different methods
that can be used and has been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first method we know traditional
breeding method that has been used and
[SPEAKER_00]: this traditional breeding method depends
on phenotype and then chemotyping that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been done, crossing the plants and
checking the pay degree for genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been the standard method that
was used last hundred years for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with this method although I
don't have doubt that was the only way and
[SPEAKER_00]: it has been successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with this method is that
cannabis plant is very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are selecting based on the visual
traits, here we are selecting based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we go into the details of the
minor cannabinoids, when we go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: details of combination of cannabinoids
which can be really good for medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation development, we cannot do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has limitation in terms of
understanding the genetics of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has limitation in terms of combining
traits together efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where last hundred years the
breeding was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently with availability of genome
sequences and recent discovery of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid terpene biosynthesis genes and
the gene sequence available, we have moved
[SPEAKER_00]: a step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have molecular markers for these
traits and these molecular markers can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used for breeding and targeted trait
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about cannabis,
it's a complex plant and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis pathways are complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where even if we use approach
such as QTLs or such as genome-wide
[SPEAKER_00]: association studies, but still there is
significant missing heritability which is
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting us from using the maximum
possible genetic gain that we can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where the genomic selection
helps in terms of bringing all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects of breeding together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make use of all the high throughput
phenotypic data, we make use of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemo-type data and the genome-estimated
breeding value that comes out of genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the missing factor that
really pushes forward in terms of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that missing heritability brought back
into the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also takes into consideration and
uses the earlier available QTLs which are
[SPEAKER_00]: major genes that has major impact on the
trait as well as the genome-wide
[SPEAKER_00]: association studies where we can select
and use many QTLs together, many genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: regions which affect the trait together to
bring all these aspects where we use the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome-estimated breeding value when we
make use of the QTLs and when we make use
[SPEAKER_00]: of the the minor alleles identified
through genome-wide association studies
[SPEAKER_00]: combined together to use this genomic
selection panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I believe the use of
genomic selection panel is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: important holy grails or one of the
important aspects those should be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Destiny Bioscience using the pipelines
for annotation, using the pipelines for
[SPEAKER_00]: SNP genotyping, using the pipelines for
identifying the punitive functional
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, those are controlled by the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have put together a very exciting
platform and opportunity that will push
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and make amazing change the way
cannabis breeding used to be then and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll do the cannabis breeding at a very
fast-paced manner in a cost-effective way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize the cannabis breeding
which is complicated, now we have
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to make use of modern
technology, sequencing technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies to integrate into the
breeding and that's going to play a major
[SPEAKER_00]: role in cannabis genetic improvement in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maximum availability of the genetic
diversity, that's a key resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is ample genetic diversity available
through all these heterozygous genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: collections available sequenced and
annotated together for molecular marker
[SPEAKER_00]: development is going to be crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it depends on, everybody has
different collections so the targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding approach and the output that
every breeding program will get depend on
[SPEAKER_00]: what is there available in their genetic
resources, in their bank for sequencing,
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping and developing their marker
development program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The role of high throughput phenotyping
and chemotyping is going to play a major
[SPEAKER_00]: role because having these data sets
properly collected, annotated,
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzed and integrated into the breeding
program is crucial for establishing these
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotyping is also one of the key areas
that should be integrated and should work
[SPEAKER_00]: hands-in-hands with phenotyping and
genotyping because having these databases
[SPEAKER_00]: and having access to minor cannabinoids,
minor terpenes analyzed through in-house
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program will be important to
dissect traits separately and then bring
[SPEAKER_00]: that targeted breeding approach for
focusing towards the minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and focus towards the terpenes which were
not considered earlier seriously and the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal potential as well as the new
opportunities that we can bring through
[SPEAKER_00]: all these minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, cannabis genome is very complex
so the genetics of these complex traits
[SPEAKER_00]: will be elucidated or will be discovered
through this genomic selection platform
[SPEAKER_00]: where high density genetic map and mapping
population as well as the understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: each cannabinoid biosynthesis gene
pathways at individual level will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely enable to even push the
percentage of these minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: higher which was not possible earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of scope to improve the
concentration of minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: through using this genomic selection
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the really interesting opportunity
that brings the research and discovery
[SPEAKER_00]: using these type of platforms is the
untouched area such as improving the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, improving the root
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the areas actually which will
push the yield forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why we see limitation in yield now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are mostly focusing on
improving the THC or CBD content but we
[SPEAKER_00]: are not focusing to improve upon the basic
yield-contributing traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are required for the yield as well
as quality improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the key traits such as improving
the photosynthesis efficiency by selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetic variation for light harvest
complex, selecting the genetic variation
[SPEAKER_00]: for Rubisco activation, and phenotyping
for all these physiological traits is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to definitely help to improve the
yield further irrespective of the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: variation that we are using as background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting area I believe we are
focusing and should be focused on is root
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the key areas where the
research and discovery is required for
[SPEAKER_00]: root biomass lateral root development root
depth development and genetics of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's key to push all these
yield-contributing traits as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the complexity of
cannabinoid, terpene biosynthesis through
[SPEAKER_00]: expression analysis, through genetic
variation analysis, and through mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis to bring that new wave of
genomics assistant breeding into cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Destiny Bioscience we are heavily
focusing on data science and machine
[SPEAKER_00]: learning approach towards precision
breeding because in the end we need
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms which can integrate all these
data sets together and then predict the
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithms or predict the patterns which
we can replicate again and again to add
[SPEAKER_00]: new traits into the breeding varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize the genomic selection
platform that we are developing at Destiny
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioscience will bring a big revolution
into the cannabis breeding, targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, and opportunity to go deep into
the discovery research of minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids enabling the extraction and
purification of all these minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids combining together to develop
better medicinal formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Christian Saucier.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the additional efforts from the
breeder's perspective when they engage
[SPEAKER_02]: with you or your platform?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the additional activities or
processes involved or costs maybe for the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder compared to more traditional
breeding plan selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The simple answer is the maximum genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: More the genetic diversity, more the
discovery, and stronger the genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: selection platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as more and more genetic diversity
comes into the breeding program,
[SPEAKER_00]: is sequenced and used for SNP genotyping
as well as SNP development, stronger the
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic selection platform becomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding more diversity, collaborating,
and working together is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: important aspects that we should do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you doing in terms of
instrumentation for your analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then are you doing that analysis at
different stages of growing to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: other paradigm in terms of how maybe RNA
is connecting to THCV levels at day 30 of
[SPEAKER_01]: the growth, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a very, very interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In breeding program, we look at the
genetic variation at genome level,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also take into consideration the
transcription, the gene expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as different isoforms of the gene
to identify which is the functional copy
[SPEAKER_00]: and which are the minor copies in
combination working for the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we take into consideration of
expression of different genes at different
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental stage to identify the
perfect expression or perfect stage which
[SPEAKER_00]: is responsible for the final chemotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more quick question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So say there's a specific cultivar that
the marketer doctors want, and we know
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're really hard to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say like a THCV cultivar in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out of Harborside or something
like that that's already been bred up to
[SPEAKER_03]: 13% or 14% THCV.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long will it take your sort of
technology to create clones of that that
[SPEAKER_03]: then farmers can grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever these new rare cannabinoid
strains are available, that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: starting resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can improve these starting
genetics for yield and other quality
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, or we can breed disease resistance
into it, which is the real value to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve this variety and make it
commercially successful in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers getting benefit growing from it
because the yield is optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these traits can be combined together
and bred into a new variety with our
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic selection approach and platform I
believe like within a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
