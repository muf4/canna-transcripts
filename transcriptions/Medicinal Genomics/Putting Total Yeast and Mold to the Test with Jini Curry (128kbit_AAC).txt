[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, I spoke with Ginny Curry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ginny is the Laboratory Director at Modern
Kana Laboratories Lakeland, Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, where she focuses on developing
standardized methods for analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to ensure harmful toxins are not
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before entering the cannabis industry,
Ginny gained valuable research experience
[SPEAKER_00]: at several well-respected institutes,
including Emory University, the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute of Aging, and the University of
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ginny recently received her master's in
medical cannabis science and therapeutics
[SPEAKER_00]: from the University of Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to running laboratory
operations for Modern Kana, Ginny is also
[SPEAKER_00]: active in other areas of the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: She currently serves on the Scientific
Advisory Board for Analytical Cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: is a member of the CASP Proficiency
Testing Task Force with AOAC
[SPEAKER_00]: International.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ginny and her team recently performed a
study that compared various methods of
[SPEAKER_00]: total yeast and mold testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their results showed that there is very
little agreement between the methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: calling into question whether total yeast
and mold is even a useful test.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the episode, we discuss why states
require total yeast and mold testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the different types of testing methods,
and how widely the results vary,
[SPEAKER_00]: how labs may not be giving yeast and mold
enough time to grow, whether the variance
[SPEAKER_00]: in total yeast and mold testing results
leads to lab shopping, and should total
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast and mold even be a required test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Ginny, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Modern Kana Laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern Kana is regarded as Florida's first
medical cannabis laboratory and one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most trusted third-party testing providers
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company's mission is to help set the
standard for cannabis testing labs
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide by providing the most accurate
and efficient testing services delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: with a sense of compassion, integrity,
and moral obligation, and to attract and
[SPEAKER_00]: attain clients who value quality data that
is verifiable, reproducible, and legally
[SPEAKER_00]: defensible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern Kana is also the only
leafy-certified laboratory in the eastern
[SPEAKER_00]: United States and adheres to the
industry's strictest SOPs and quality
[SPEAKER_00]: control standards.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Ginny
[SPEAKER_00]: Curry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning Ginny, thanks for joining us
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I read your article in
Analytical Cannabis about the benefits and
[SPEAKER_00]: pitfalls of total yeast and mold counts in
cannabis labs, and I'll put a link to that
[SPEAKER_00]: in the show description so people can
check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first, I want to thank you for writing
it because our team at Medicinal Genomics,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been talking about issues with total
yeast and mold for years now, and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: published papers on it, we've done
webinars about it, we've done canned med
[SPEAKER_00]: talks about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we're a kit manufacturer,
our message is sort of met with some
[SPEAKER_00]: skepticism because obviously we have a dog
in the fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for an independent lab like Modern
Kana to raise some concerns, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we think should resonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into the investigation
that your team did, maybe it's best to set
[SPEAKER_00]: the table for any listeners who aren't
well versed in cannabis testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you explain what the total yeast
and mold testing requirements are in
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida, at least to start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the state of Florida, the testing
requirements involve testing final product
[SPEAKER_01]: in its final packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So flour is kind of what we're going to
focus on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where the problems of total yeast and
mold are seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that, the limit is 100,000 CFP
per gram in the state of Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting is you have states that
have no total yeast and mold requirements
[SPEAKER_01]: to states that have 100 CFP per gram yeast
and mold requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a pretty vast range across the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, it causes some
issues as well on that front with data and
[SPEAKER_01]: with methodology, because if the
methodology doesn't allow you to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to meet those requirements, labs are not
going to be able to produce accurate data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that total yeast and mold,
basically we're looking at how much mold
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeast are in that flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not looking at any sort of species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not looking at specifics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an overall kind of big picture
of what's going on in that cannabis flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an important distinction to
make, because you mentioned that some
[SPEAKER_00]: states, they don't have total yeast and
mold testing requirements, but they do
[SPEAKER_00]: have species specific tests for things
that we know are pathogenic, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does Florida actually test for aspergillus
as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we require aspergillus all four species
to be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as well as that, it's salmonella
and sugar toxin E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and flour samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that's a good question then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're already kind of testing for
the known pathogenic species, what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit of a total yeast and mold test
from a consumer perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think really it, and that's kind of
where I think the misconceptions may arise
[SPEAKER_01]: from, is that consumers have been kind of,
it's been portrayed to them that,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, it's telling me, you know,
is my flour moldy?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem with that is there's good
yeasts and there's good molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so looking at a total count,
you're sometimes going to skew those
[SPEAKER_01]: results and you're going to make a patient
believe they're not safe when really they
[SPEAKER_01]: are, or a consumer, depending on if you're
in a recreational or medicinal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, and that's a good example with
aspergillus too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were only testing for total yeast
and mold and you had a threshold set to
[SPEAKER_00]: say a hundred thousand CFUs, you could
have 99,000 CFUs of aspergillus in your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not good for anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the things that we
mentioned, I mentioned in the article is
[SPEAKER_01]: like looking at those pathogenic species,
because if you don't, then a product may
[SPEAKER_01]: seem safe when it actually truly isn't
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, now that we've established that,
so what prompted you and the team at
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern Candor to investigate total yeast
and mold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, what questions were you looking
to answer?
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we, similar to medicinal
genomics, have had lots of questions about
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast and mold over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the first testing lab in the state of
Florida, we originally started with
[SPEAKER_01]: plating total yeast and mold using like
compact dry plates and then moved into PCR
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did PCR testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after certification, we certified
through PCR for total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're running samples and we actually had
a client come back and say, they tested
[SPEAKER_01]: with another lab and got much higher
counts than what we got with PCR and they
[SPEAKER_01]: used plating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after that, that really triggered
me to start diving in.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, the science is the
most important part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so figuring out that science and
figuring out is there issues and how can
[SPEAKER_01]: we adapt for those issues was really my
goal of doing this investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicinal genomics has been wonderful with
helping do R&D and really talking us
[SPEAKER_01]: through some of the troubleshooting we've
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started by, you know, doing some
dilutions in PCR and kind of trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: determine if there was some suppression
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did see that there was in cases
where if there's a ton of yeast and mold
[SPEAKER_01]: in sample, there can be suppression.
[SPEAKER_01]: There can be suppression on the PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started adapting the medicinal
genomics method to upfront, do a 20X
[SPEAKER_01]: dilution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of doing one to 10 grams like
the protocol calls for, we moved to doing
[SPEAKER_01]: one gram of flour to 20 mils of TSB in
order to really prevent that suppression
[SPEAKER_01]: from happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really saw a big difference in the
reproducibility once we started doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that, because we were no longer fighting,
okay, is there too much yeast and mold in
[SPEAKER_01]: that sample?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because in those cases, what you
would sort of be doing a rerun with a
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution to sort of make sure that you
aren't overloading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's ultimately what we ended up
doing is, you know, I kind of talked to
[SPEAKER_01]: the team at medicinal genomics about as
far as the CQ values on QPCR, what I
[SPEAKER_01]: should be seeing changes if I do
dilutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started applying those
dilutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took a sample and we did a 2X
dilution and then we did a 5X dilution and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we did a 10X dilution and we watched
how those CQ values should change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that they should change in a
very particular way and shift,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, downfield to be a higher CQ
value, lower reported value, but we
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't always seeing that if we just did
the one to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we leave too many people in the
dust here, because, you know, this
[SPEAKER_00]: audience, I mean, I know anyone who's
familiar with medicinal genomics,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to understand this,
but, you know, this is a canned med
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some people that are more on the
medical side or more on the cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was hoping maybe you could briefly
explain the difference between like
[SPEAKER_00]: plating and culture based methods and PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with plating, basically what you're
doing is you're taking your sample and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're diluting it in some sort of a
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're taking that media and
you're adding that to a plate,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that be an agar, whether that be a
petri film plate, whether that be a
[SPEAKER_01]: compact dry plate, whatever type of
culture method you're using, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to add that diluted sample to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's particular amounts that you
add, you know, for the agar plates,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using only 0.1 mil, but for,
you know, petri film, you're using a full
[SPEAKER_01]: mil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to factor dilutions into that
as well, because that changes your result.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much you plate is going to have a
significant impact on what you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: see your outcome be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So versus PCR, which, you know,
is the process of taking the sample and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're extracting the DNA from that
sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you're doing is you're
isolating not only the cannabis DNA,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're also isolating the microbe DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then using a primer, you basically
take your DNA that you've obtained and you
[SPEAKER_01]: mix it with a primer and then you load it
onto the PCR and it undergoes a process of
[SPEAKER_01]: heating and cooling in order to anneal
that DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when those microbes are present,
they bind to that primer and they anneal
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you'll fluoresce, have
fluorescence and you'll see what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The great thing about QPCR is you have an
internal control, which is hex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that hex fluorescence lets you know
that you have cannabis DNA and that your
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pro to PCR versus plating.
[SPEAKER_01]: With plating, you have no way of knowing
if it was plated correctly and if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually getting solution on the plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with PCR, if you don't get that
hex, you know your extraction didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't say for sure if that sample
really has Easter mold or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an excellent description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I gonna use that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your investigation, if I read it
correctly, you're primarily comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: plating methods to one another,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did compare kind of the PCR as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran PCR on those samples, but mostly it
was for us to do plating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state of Florida is potentially
considering moving away from QPCR for
twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if that happens, we wanted to be
prepared since originally we were only
[SPEAKER_01]: certified for QPCR and total yeast and
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a number of different
plating methods for total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like based on your results
that they don't necessarily agree with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the differences here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,
but in order for a plate to work,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're putting the microbes into a
solution that's supposed to be optimized
[SPEAKER_00]: for growth for a certain type of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, a total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I understand it, it's very
difficult to actually capture all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast and mold that could potentially be
there and effectively exclude any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria or other organisms that could be
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really the big battle with
plating is, you know, ensuring that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not getting bacterial growth and that you
are getting only yeast and mold growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also are combating the fact that
aspergillus doesn't grow well on plating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for that, if you're plating and you
have aspergillus, you're still going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get lower counts than what is
representative of the sample because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not able to grow those.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't culture well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't survive in that type of
environment, which is why QPCR is so
[SPEAKER_01]: important for some of the speciation
testing because that's the only way you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to accurately identify
those compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's get into your results here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please talk about the number of
different methods that you that you did
[SPEAKER_00]: and sort of what your process was and
ultimately what you guys found.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did was we started with seven
different types of plates or agars and
[SPEAKER_01]: used all seven of those and ran the same
sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took a sample and we actually ran
the sample in triplicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we ran it at three different
dilutions for each plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big study.
[SPEAKER_01]: My microbiologists were phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were troopers through the entire
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a lot of plates to manage and
to count and to keep track of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at compact dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at petri film, rapid yeast and
mold, petri film, non rapid yeast and
[SPEAKER_01]: mold, potato dextrose agar, potato
dextrose agar with chlorotetracicline,
[SPEAKER_01]: dichlorine, rose bengal, chloramethyl and
sabdex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to attempt that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are more kind of formally known
as PDA, PDA-C, DRBC and sabdex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we took all of those plates,
we plated them, we looked at, OK,
[SPEAKER_01]: what type of dilution needs to be done on
the plates, those agars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the PDA, PDA-C, DRBC and sabdex all
needed to be plated at point one mils
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the compact dry rapid yeast and
mold and non rapid yeast and mold petri
[SPEAKER_01]: films needed to be plated at a mil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we mapped out what our dilutions needed
to be in order to obtain the same dilution
[SPEAKER_01]: on each plate and then went about making
those dilutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the dilutions were made for all of
them at the same time and they were all
[SPEAKER_01]: taken from the same source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that ensured that the homogeneity
wasn't going to be in question because one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the fights you're combating with
cannabis is it's not homogenous and the
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast and mold is not going to be spread
evenly throughout the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get one scoop that, you know,
has tons of yeast and mold and you may get
[SPEAKER_01]: another scoop that doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to standardize that and
ensure that we were getting a good,
[SPEAKER_01]: true result, we only used the sample once
and then we did it for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same for PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also ran PCR on these.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we found from the plating was it was
a little shocking to kind of see how
[SPEAKER_01]: vastly different some of the results were
and then also how different the incubation
[SPEAKER_01]: times were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, rapid yeast and mold on
petri film, they recommend, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 48 hours, but between the 48 hour and the
72 hour mark, we saw the yeast and mold on
[SPEAKER_01]: those plates almost double.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a lab that's, you know,
going by the manufacturer recommendation
[SPEAKER_01]: and only incubating for 48 hours,
they could be severely under quantifying
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast and mold in those samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, we established
true incubation times for each of the
[SPEAKER_01]: different plates we're utilizing so that
we knew kind of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long did it need to incubate?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did that by we started viewing the
plates at 48 hours and we view the plates
[SPEAKER_01]: at 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours and 120
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at the change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the true incubation time was
defined as the point in time where no new
[SPEAKER_01]: colonies appeared and instead the colonies
just grew in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were able to map that out and
really determine, OK, when do you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: incubate this to to really let all of the
yeast and mold grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the ultimate result that you got,
like when you're comparing to other
[SPEAKER_00]: methods, did they all arrive at the same,
you know, number or was it sort of all
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is even in plating,
we saw a lot of suppression occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your lower dilutions, you know,
the standard protocol in plating is to
[SPEAKER_01]: plate at three dilutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you plated a 100 X,
you plated a 1000 X and you plated a 10000
[SPEAKER_01]: X.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we saw was if you took the
average of those three results,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is kind of the standard for this
type of methodology, that 100 X was
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing suppression and therefore
driving the overall result down,
[SPEAKER_01]: thus skewing those results low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when, in fact, the product may have
failed, had you factored in the 1000 X and
[SPEAKER_01]: the 10000 X, when you factored in that
1000 X, it drove the average down enough
[SPEAKER_01]: that the product passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's interesting when you're
talking about sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about subsampling from that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're talking about taking like a
smaller volume out of that original sample
[SPEAKER_00]: prep, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And putting that on to the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you could potentially be
missing other microbes that don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: plated, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing being is that,
you know, if you aren't able to ensure it
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed well, how do you know that you've
got a good amount of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever those microbes are versus just
your media?
[SPEAKER_01]: So versus just your TSB, for example,
how do you know you mixed it well?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, you know, I think PCR
has the benefit over plating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because you are able to ensure the
process worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with plating, there is no internal
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, too, as you pointed
out in your results here is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plating, it really relies on
this growth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, you know, depending on how long you
let it go, you're going to get a different
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with PCR, it is, I mean,
it is a snapshot of what is in there at
[SPEAKER_00]: this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you, I mean, if you kept the
isolated DNA, for another week or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you wouldn't see as drastic a difference
in results, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of the battle of
plating versus PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the other comments that
people will sometimes make is,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, PCR doesn't tell you if the DNA is
dead or alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by running PCR, you're getting
everything that's present.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not just getting the things that
are alive and harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the caveat to that in the conversation
that needs to be had regarding that is
[SPEAKER_01]: that if that DNA is present, that
indicates it was alive at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have aspergillus,
for example, that, you know, is now dead
[SPEAKER_01]: but was once alive, it could have created
mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now you have a whole nother
contaminant you're fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a place, too, where I think
that there needs to be more education
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding the microbes and how microbes
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't think that people always
realize that, that like dead versus alive
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't matter because if it was there,
it could have caused other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, too, that we run into
all the time is comparing QPCR results to
[SPEAKER_00]: plating results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, how come they don't match
up in certain situations?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like, I mean, looking at
your results, plating doesn't even agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with plating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of where I think the more
research needs to be done is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody kind of dove into
cannabis testing headfirst.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't necessarily know if the
knowledge and the research was deep enough
[SPEAKER_01]: for a headfirst jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: The waters may have been a little too
shallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that may be causing a lot of these
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, you know, my study,
the purpose of this was to get people
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about total yeast in mold more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get people having these
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get people doing more research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can involve universities
who have the time and the money and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, amount of lab techs that are
needed to do these types of studies so we
[SPEAKER_01]: can really figure out if total yeast in
mold is going to continue being a
[SPEAKER_01]: requirement in cannabis, what is the best
method?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we know that's the best method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there needs to be some sort of
some sort of truth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting a whole lot of different
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, yeah, we need we need to figure out
which one's which one's correct and
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrate.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really where those questions
arose during our investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we found a standard reference
material from an ISO accredited provider.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when looking at that reference
material, we noticed that it had two
[SPEAKER_01]: drastically different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: The values were one hundred and fifty two
thousand CFU per gram compared to four
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred and twenty three thousand CFU per
gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, those are concerningly
different numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we did more reading, we noticed
there was a footer and that footer said
[SPEAKER_01]: that one was plated with petrifilm and the
other was plated with sabdex agar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question is, you know,
you're looking at a result that's three
[SPEAKER_01]: times higher than the other, which which
is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you notice that labs, I think most
labs probably go about using the petrifilm
[SPEAKER_01]: rapid yeast and mold plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell you you only need to incubate
for 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for labs who are trying to meet
these quick turnaround times, that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be what they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that is, in fact, leading to a
result that's three times lower than
[SPEAKER_01]: another culture based media, is that
really a valid method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brings up another point,
too, is that if you have different labs
[SPEAKER_00]: doing different methods and one's using a
method that's giving lower results,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we get into this issue of lab
shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people people, you know,
it puts labs in an uncomfortable position
[SPEAKER_01]: because clients come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, well, this lab obtained this
result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't you obtaining this result?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, well, we're going to take
our business somewhere where we can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: lower result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's why standards in
general are so important, but especially
[SPEAKER_01]: with things where we're seeing such vastly
different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with analytical chemistry,
you know, chemistry is one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like there's a known amount of that
thing and everybody should be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: obtain the same number.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my microbes and microbiology is so
vastly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on, you know, how they
incubated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it get incubated at the right
temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it get checked on at the right time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the dilution get done correctly?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different factors that can
change the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from seeing this, it seems like all
kind of standard reference materials that
[SPEAKER_01]: are created for micro seem to just kind of
be consensus basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's run multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: By multiple different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever the average they obtain is,
is that, you know, certified value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, you run into
issues because if they're using different
[SPEAKER_01]: methods, they're getting very different
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked a little bit about how how
QPCR performed and how how it compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the plating results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm curious, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you talked about how, you know,
even some methods when you did different
[SPEAKER_00]: dilutions, or you did it in triplicate,
but those results didn't didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: line up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How consistent was the QPCR results when
you did that, though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not having to deal with the
the issue of growth and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we and you know, this is one of the
other struggles we kind of faced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we worked with medicinal genomics
quite a bit on this is we were having some
[SPEAKER_01]: lack of reproducibility there as well with
dilutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what led us to that
bigger dilution up front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is because of those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you're looking at a log
scale, you have to realize that when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're performing that conversion
calculation from QC or CQ value to CFU per
[SPEAKER_01]: gram, you it is a logarithmic kind of
formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that result, the larger dilution you do
is going to start to over quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really the big thing we saw
is if you do too big of a dilution in
[SPEAKER_01]: QPCR, you're going to over quantify
drastically because you're still going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the logarithmic scale is not
going to be able to account for how large
[SPEAKER_01]: of a dilution you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about that, that one to 20
dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did just recently publish an
updated protocol for QIM using that very
[SPEAKER_00]: same dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for your help on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess kind of wrapping up here,
I'm curious, what was sort of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: surprising thing you learned during this
whole exercise?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that we're not 100% sure that
really yeast and mold is figured out
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just not confident that it is a
good test for cannabis material just
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the lack of homogenization in
cannabis, because of the complexity of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it really providing what consumers
need to know that they're safe?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not looking at some of these
other microbes, such as powdery mildew or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Fusarium species or penicillium
species, and those don't grow well on
[SPEAKER_01]: plates or those aren't identified even in
QPCR, you're running into, are patients
[SPEAKER_01]: truly safe with total yeast and mold
testing or do we need more pathogenic
[SPEAKER_01]: testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And after this study, I am definitely
leaning on the side of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need more pathogenic testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think total yeast and mold testing is a
great representation for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the grower or the producer of how clean
their process is, but I don't think it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: good indication of how safe the product
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, no, that's an important
distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we, I think we agree with
you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, total yeast and mold,
it's sort of a big thing to take on there
[SPEAKER_00]: to really put a stake in the ground and
say this is the total amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's very difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's lots of species.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of species of mold and yeast
and you just you don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't determine if it's all growing on
the plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some consultations with some
microbiologists and one of them actually
[SPEAKER_01]: told us that in culture, even in culture
based media, you're only going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: about one fourth of what a sample truly
has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of crazy to think about
as well because you're facing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, viable versus culturable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, and that's a good point,
too, because I think I did see in your
[SPEAKER_00]: article that you mentioned testing
irradiated products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find anything interesting there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with irradiated products, we almost
always never see QPCR hits or if they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're very, very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: With plating, we saw kind of the same
thing, but there was some weird reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: that was going on, especially on the Petri
film, and it was changing the color of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the entire plate changed to a color
that would indicate yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on Petri film, for example,
you're looking at, you know, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for those blue colonies and the
whole plate would turn blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, OK, wait, what's what's
happening here?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a full plate of colonies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like blown out or what's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did lots of dilutions and we did see
as we diluted things out, those plates
[SPEAKER_01]: turned less blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think that that radiation may have
played a factor into some sort of reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: happening on those plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it created some sort of some sort of
chemical reaction that just turned
[SPEAKER_00]: everything blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're we're really not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's another thing that needs to
be further investigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's some research that
indicates that radiation just knocks down
[SPEAKER_01]: the cells versus fully destroying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if that's the case, you know,
if you grow these things for even longer
[SPEAKER_01]: than one hundred and twenty hours,
are you eventually going to start seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: growth on them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it is that the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I again, total yeast and mold needs
a lot more research done before anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: makes any conclusive decisions about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I think you already said this,
but I'll give it I'll give you another
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the results of your your
investigation here, what what would you
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend would be the best course for
testing to make sure that patients are
[SPEAKER_00]: safe from any pathogenic yeast and mold?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think number one, more research needs to
be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: More people need to participate in studies
and we need to do investigations and PT
[SPEAKER_01]: providers and reference material
providers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to work together to try to figure
out how to get a good, true representative
[SPEAKER_01]: sample that could be distributed and
tested by multiple different laboratories
[SPEAKER_01]: and by multiple different methods to see
what kind of lines up where.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, I personally believe that
maybe moving away from total yeast and
[SPEAKER_01]: mold and cannabis is is the right
decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And adding some additional species,
I know we would be, you know, happy to
[SPEAKER_01]: test things like powdery mildew and
frusarium and penicillium species versus
[SPEAKER_01]: testing that total yeast and mold,
because, you know, in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew is something is very,
very, very, very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not something that grows well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also something that if you run a
standard total yeast and mold panel using
[SPEAKER_01]: QPCR, you're not going to identify either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a good point you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like is total yeast and mold a good test
for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it used in other testing, food testing,
things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But surprisingly, in food testing,
we kind of did some looking into USP 61
[SPEAKER_01]: versus USP 62.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did see that in food testing,
it's more of along the lines of gauging
[SPEAKER_01]: how clean the process was versus gauging
if the process, you know, is safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lettuce, I can guarantee you,
your lettuce probably has a lot more total
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast and mold on it than what you're
seeing in your cannabis, because the
[SPEAKER_01]: testing that they're performing is mostly
for, you know, salmonella, shiga toxin E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, those pathogenic species that are
dangerous versus those total yeast and
[SPEAKER_01]: mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing lettuce in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lettuce you grow on the ground is
going to have some yeast and mold on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're growing it in a humid
environment.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the examples we always bring
up, too, is that, you know, sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: get strawberries from the grocery store,
and a day later, you open up the fridge
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have fuzz all over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not completely clean either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that also comes down to
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, people, whether it's been,
you know, legally or not, have been using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for quite some time and years
before testing was even a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even out in some states that testing
wasn't originally required.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rules on testing weren't developed
until after a program was started up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in those instances, things weren't
being tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were, you know, using product
without being concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that testing is required,
people are more and more concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think ultimately, you know,
yeast and mold could even be visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, does the bud have mold on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it does, don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's that's also something
that where education needs to be added is
[SPEAKER_01]: like visually inspecting something and
really determining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, if your strawberries that
you open from your fridge have fuzz on
[SPEAKER_01]: them, you're not going to eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same kind of goes with your
cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little common sense goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winding down here, Janie, I did want to
give you an opportunity before I let you
[SPEAKER_00]: go to plug any website, social media or
any additional resources that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: would be helpful for the listeners to
learn more about what we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, you know, analytical
cannabis is a great resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a provider who does a lot of
publications on cannabis testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as our website, moderncana.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got lots of information as well,
kind of on different blogs, on testing and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to also be on the lookout for more
presentations from our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a lot more research and
development now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be participating in a
lot more kind of presentations and
[SPEAKER_01]: conferences that are mostly focused on
standardization in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not just yeast and mold, but across the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be on the lookout for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to have you back on to talk
about something else and hopefully we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see you out at CanMed as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, Janie.
