[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd also like to thank the McKernons
for asking me to participate in this and
[SPEAKER_00]: also for being very wonderful colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Brian said, I'm going to be talking
about the role of cannabidiol in the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment of refractory pediatric
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been a huge focus of our work
over the past three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really an honor to be able to come
and talk with you about what we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, I have been very involved
with GW Pharma in these clinical trials
[SPEAKER_00]: and the expanded access program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my disclosures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought it would be good to
start, since this is a mixed audience,
[SPEAKER_00]: first kind of really describing what
epilepsy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, a seizure is a disturbance
in the electrical activity of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And epilepsy is simply defined as two or
more unprovoked seizures occurring greater
[SPEAKER_00]: than 24 hours apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And epilepsy is actually a spectrum of
disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many, many different types of
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many, many causes of seizures,
both in children and adult, with some
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap but some quite distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also many epilepsy syndromes
as well as types of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medically refractory or intractable
seizures are defined as seizures that are
[SPEAKER_00]: not controlled by anticonvulsant
medications or are controlled only by
[SPEAKER_00]: medications that have significant side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's estimated that one third of
individuals, children and adults,
[SPEAKER_00]: who develop epilepsy will go on to have
intractable or refractory epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking then at what an unmet need for
treatments are in this country,
[SPEAKER_00]: the incidence of epilepsy in the United
States per year is estimated 150,000 new
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prevalence of epilepsy in the
United States is about 2.2 million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prevalence of epilepsy worldwide is
greater than 65 million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the estimate of prevalence of
refractory epilepsy in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: is about 730,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worldwide, it's 21.7 million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite a significant healthcare issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently in 2017, we do have options for
children and adults when they develop
[SPEAKER_00]: refractory epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, medications, we've had 17 new
medications become available over the past
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also an important role for dietary
therapy which can be very effective in
[SPEAKER_00]: treating epilepsy as well as our
neurostimulators, both the vagus
[SPEAKER_00]: neurostimulator and the responsive
neurostimulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a role for epilepsy
surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in spite of these treatments,
particularly the 17 new medications,
[SPEAKER_00]: the incidence of refractory epilepsy has
really not changed over time, which
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrates that there continues to be
really a significant unmet need for
[SPEAKER_00]: effective, safe, and tolerated therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then kind of making a case for
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I think most of this
audience knows, but the medical community
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of naive and ignorant of,
as this is not really a new idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've had some discussion today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to just briefly review
through history some of the references to
[SPEAKER_00]: the treatment of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll look briefly at the mechanisms
of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they make sense as a possible treatment
for epilepsy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the pre-clinical studies that have
been done in the animal models of
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy, and then turn to what is the
clinical data, and then what do we still
[SPEAKER_00]: need to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as this audience knows, cannabis has
actually been used as a medical treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first reference in the use of epilepsy
was in Texan, 2200 BCE from Samaria,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then from the Middle East kind of were
also descriptions in 1100 and 1400 CE.
[SPEAKER_00]: About using cannabis specifically in the
treatment of seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recent history in 1842, O'Shaughnessy
reported that cannabis reduced infantile
[SPEAKER_00]: convulsions, then suggesting also that
could be effective treatment in infants
[SPEAKER_00]: with seizures as well as others,
as well as hydrophobia, lockjaw,
[SPEAKER_00]: and rheumatism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1856, McMeans reported the
successful use of a tincture of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: indica in four children with epilepsy,
including a seven-week female.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1881, William Gowers, who is a very,
very famous child neurologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every neurologist knows his name,
reported that cannabis had been
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended for epilepsy by Russell
Reynolds in 1861 as a sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: though not very frequently useful,
small value as an adjunct to the bromide,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is sometimes of considerable service
given separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gowers actually administered cannabis
in many cases with the effect of delaying
[SPEAKER_00]: the paracysms and mitigating the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the 1850s and early 1900s,
I think that cannabis was used very
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently and widely in the United States
and elsewhere in the treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we all know, in 1851 actually,
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, cannabis compounds were
suggested for neuralgia, depression,
[SPEAKER_00]: hemorrhage, pain relief, muscle spasms,
convulsive disorders, and other ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1860, the Ohio Medical Society
Committee on Cannabis Indica said that
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy was claimed for infantile
convulsions, epilepsy, and many other
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, amounting evidence over time,
including the 1800s, that this could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: very effective treatment for epilepsy,
very important then because at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: there were only, really only one
medication available in the treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we all know, and I was
actually sad to learn that it was my blue
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Massachusetts in 1911 that became
the first state to outlaw cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: setting the prohibition of alcohol,
and the other states quickly followed with
[SPEAKER_00]: the marijuana prohibition laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we all know, in 1970,
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlled Substance Act passed
classifying marijuana as a drug with no
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as we've discussed today,
as all of us are aware, the not only not
[SPEAKER_00]: put kind of incredible limitations on this
clinical use, but also research into the
[SPEAKER_00]: possible benefits of the compounds in the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1996, California became the first state
to legalize medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by 2015, medical marijuana was
legalized in 23 states, again regulated at
[SPEAKER_00]: the state level by the DEA, and CBD
specifically was made legal in an
[SPEAKER_00]: additional 16 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this has been a fabulous
and incredible movement to watch because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think a lot of this was really driven by
the patient community that really wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: access to this treatment, not only for
their children with epilepsy, but for
[SPEAKER_00]: other disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as we're all aware,
over the past several years, there's been
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing anecdotal reports about the
efficacy of medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the CBD-enriched formations in
the treatment of pediatric epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been, I think, every child
neurologist and most neurologists in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country have not seen a patient with
epilepsy in the past three or four years
[SPEAKER_00]: without the patient or their parents
asking for access to this as a treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: for their seizure disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Katherine Jacobs and Brenda Porter kind
of did a Facebook survey and solicited
[SPEAKER_00]: data on Facebook, sort of 150 families
whose children had been using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol-rich cannabis to treat their
drug-resistant seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a low response rate of only 12.7,
and the patients or kids included Dravet
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome kids, Deuce syndrome,
which is a myoclonic-aesthetic epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: another very highly refractory epilepsy,
one with Lennox-Gasto, which we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing about later by Dr. Devinsky,
one with idiopaths, idiopathic epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this population that responded to the
survey had been on an average of 12 prior
[SPEAKER_00]: anticonvulsant medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, 84% noted seizure decreased
frequency on the CBD, including two that
[SPEAKER_00]: had experienced a complete remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a low number, but remember these
children had been on a prior mean of 12
[SPEAKER_00]: medications, so really highly medically
refractory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cannabidiol was associated with
adverse events, and drowsiness was fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: common, as was fatigue, and also was noted
some positive benefits, better mood,
[SPEAKER_00]: increased alertness, and improved sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: A similar study was done by the folks at
UCLA, and they also did an online survey
[SPEAKER_00]: of parents of children with epilepsy who
had also used CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They received 117 responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mean latency from the onset of
epilepsy to the use of CBD was five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of these kids also were
refractory having been on a mean of eight
[SPEAKER_00]: prior medications, and their population
included 53 kids with infantile spasms,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also considered a catastrophic or
malignant form of epilepsy, or
[SPEAKER_00]: Lennox-Gasto syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar to the other survey,
85 reported a reduction in seizure
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency, including 14 who became
seizure-free, and again, many reported
[SPEAKER_00]: improved sleep, alertness, and mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these studies did remark that
there were limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were subject to participation bias,
the people who responded to the survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unknown formulations of cannabidiol
products these kids were receiving,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was also no control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, there was a lot of
pressure, and it was really a concern to
[SPEAKER_00]: us, as John said earlier, as being child
neurologists, of wanting to do right by
[SPEAKER_00]: our patients and making sure what they're
taking is safe, well tolerated,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as efficacious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of looking then,
does it work via the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors, as we've talked about,
and you all know better than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is the only plant species that
contains cannabinoids, and we've already
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed the cannabinoid receptor family,
but this has had me interested for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years, and could this be a potential
treatment for epilepsy, since these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: contain chemicals, as we've discussed,
that our brains have receptors for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've already discussed the
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But kind of, could they be playing a role
somehow in epilepsy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower levels of anantamide have been found
in the CSF of patients with newly
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosed temporal lobe epilepsy,
and tissue resected during epilepsy
[SPEAKER_00]: surgery was found to have lower levels of
the CB1 receptor mRNA, and also reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of the enzyme responsible for
the synthesis of 2AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we've discussed, cannabidiol does
not appear to exert its main neuronal
[SPEAKER_00]: effects through the activation of CB1
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it may function as indirect
antagonists at high levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, there is a lot of interest,
and I know many people in the room work on
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but what could be the possible
mechanisms then of cannabidiol in the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment of seizures?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been shown that it decreases
presynaptic release of glutamate,
[SPEAKER_00]: glutamate being the main excitatory amino
acid in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been shown to do this by binding
to the members of the TRIP family of
[SPEAKER_00]: cation channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been shown to activate serotonin
receptors, inhibit adenosine reuptake,
[SPEAKER_00]: both of which we think are somehow
involved in epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also thought that it could have
anti-inflammatory properties, antioxidant
[SPEAKER_00]: properties, and there's some interest that
it could modulate the mTOR pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we know is a pathway involved in a
disorder called tuberous sclerosis
[SPEAKER_00]: complex, where 85 percent of those
individuals have epilepsy often
[SPEAKER_00]: refractory, and it may also be involved in
other forms of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what have the animal models shown us?
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD has actually been shown to be
effective in several acute seizure models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any drug undergoing development for
seizures is used in several different
[SPEAKER_00]: animal models of induced seizures,
including the PTZ model, MES,
[SPEAKER_00]: pylocarpine-induced temporal lobe
seizures, as well as penicillin-induced
[SPEAKER_00]: partial seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was effective in all of those
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is less convincing data in chronic
seizure models, but that is very
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been shown that CBD increases
the after-discharge threshold and reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: the after-discharge amplitude,
duration, and propagation in
[SPEAKER_00]: electrically-kindled limbic seizures in
rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty good pre-clinical evidence
through the animal models that this could
[SPEAKER_00]: be effective for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So several years ago now, we became
involved with GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a product licensed in over 30
countries in development in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States called Sativex, which is 50 percent
THC, 50 percent CBD, used for MS
[SPEAKER_00]: spasticity and also pain, and they were
doing pre-clinical studies looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol and would it be effective in
the treatment of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their product, Epidiolex, is a 99 percent
pure oil-based cannabidiol extract of
[SPEAKER_00]: constant composition, and it's in a
100-milligram-per-mil sesame oil-based
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with GW Pharma, initial activities was
the Expanded Access Program, and about
[SPEAKER_00]: almost four years ago now, five academic
centers got together with GW to discuss,
[SPEAKER_00]: could we try and see if this would be safe
and effective, as well as tolerated in our
[SPEAKER_00]: patient population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all approached the FDA and the DEA,
and each site was given permission to put
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 children on Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial 25 children we put on this
treatment, we actually had to send
[SPEAKER_00]: biographies of each child to the FDA
describing the child, their epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was due to, how many medications
it had been on, how many medications they
[SPEAKER_00]: were on, how many seizures they had a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these kids had had epilepsy
surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these kids were on dietary
therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these kids had devices,
but all of these children continued to
[SPEAKER_00]: have pretty significant frequent seizure
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were five initial sites,
and several were added afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MGH ended up enrolling 57 total
patients in the Expanded Access Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial 25 started the medication in
April of 2014, so we have many children
[SPEAKER_00]: who have now been on this as a treatment
for their epilepsy for three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, as Dr. Dvinsky will talk about in
the next talk, GW then went on to sponsor
[SPEAKER_00]: trials in Dravet Syndrome, and the results
from the first RCT have been released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Dvinsky will review those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two trials in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome,
both of which had been complete,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the data has been released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also they are now enrolling in a
trial in the treatment of refractory
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also planned trials in infantile
spasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm gonna do the rest of the time
is just discuss what we've seen from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Expanded Access Program, and this is the
first data cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now in 2017, there are over 1,000
children on Epidiolex through the Expanded
[SPEAKER_00]: Access Program and also some of the state
programs that GW has been working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we looked at this data, there were
214 kids ages one to 30 years who had been
[SPEAKER_00]: on greater than 12 weeks of CBD between
January of 2014 and 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of this, again, it was an open
label, Expanded Access Compassionate Use
[SPEAKER_00]: Program, but we really wanted to determine
the safety, tolerability, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy of CBD in treating our patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran it like a trial, even though it was
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 12-week safety tolerability data was
available on 162 kids at this data cut and
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy data on 137.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this data was collected from 11 of the
sites involved in the Expanded Access
[SPEAKER_00]: Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it was Compassionate Use Open
Label.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not a controlled trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these patients had significantly
medically refractory epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did kind of come up with a shared
trial design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kids were started on 2.5 to 5
milligrams per kilogram per day of the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, increasing weekly, initially to a
goal dose of 25 milligrams per kilogram
[SPEAKER_00]: per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If children were tolerating that and
continued to have seizures, the FDA and
[SPEAKER_00]: the DEA then gave us permission at some
sites to further tie trade up to 50
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per kilogram per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to a clinical trial, we did do a
four-week baseline to kind of get a sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seizure frequency at baseline
before starting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kids had to have a minimum of four
seizures during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during the trial period,
all medications, diet, and VNS were stable
[SPEAKER_00]: for the month prior to enrollment and were
continued kind of at stable doses
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And parents maintained daily detailed
seizure diaries so we'd be able to really
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The age range, the mean, was 10.5 years
with a range of .9 to 26.2 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sex was about equal between boys and
girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The background AEDs was an average of
three with a range of zero to seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seizure frequency monthly,
these kids were having a lot of seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The median was 60.5 seizures per month
with a range of 19.6 to 151.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we looked at safety and tolerability
was there were adverse events in about 78%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A somulence in about 25%, which we now
appreciate is largely due to a drug-drug
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with those children on
clobizam.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a decreased appetite and some
diarrhea, which actually many of these
[SPEAKER_00]: parents thought was a positive side
effects because a lot of these kids with
[SPEAKER_00]: highly refractory epilepsy and significant
neurologic issues often have very chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: constipation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they viewed this as a positive in many
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fatigue and then convulsions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, convulsions, this was a popular
population of kids with highly refractory
[SPEAKER_00]: active seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just probably typically their
normal fluctuation of seizure activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serious adverse events include status as
the most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, reflecting the epilepsy condition
of this population, diarrhea and weight
[SPEAKER_00]: loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, only five withdrew from treatment
due to an adverse event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw for efficacy, we were very
encouraged by.
[SPEAKER_00]: 36.5 median reduction of motor seizures
over the 12-week period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhat higher in those children that had
Dravet syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five patients became seizure-free of
all motor seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's five, but these are some
of my most highly refractory epilepsy
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that any of them became
seizure-free, I really thought was fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: miraculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: 54 or 39% had a greater than 50% or were
considered responders.
[SPEAKER_00]: A greater than 50% reduction in motor
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some children doing extremely well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 32 of the patients had atonic
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when the children fall very
suddenly to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those seizures carry with them the risk
of significant injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the kids you usually see
wearing the helmets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And impressively, 56% of those with atonic
seizures had a greater than 50% reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 16% became seizure-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a graph from the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see here, the x-axis is
actually looking at each individual
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see down here, there were
some children who did not seem to benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from the CBD treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, some had an increase in seizure
frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see here, many of the
children had a significant increase with a
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease of up to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the last four weeks in the
study treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these five children were
seizure-free throughout the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we were very enthusiastic about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was criticized since this was open
label, no placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was great concern that due to the
excitement and hype about the possible
[SPEAKER_00]: role of CBD in treating epilepsy,
that there would be a significant placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you'll see when Dr. Devinsky
presents the data from the randomized
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled trials, it was very similar,
actually, with the efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of what do we need to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: All efficacy data until recently has been
anecdotal or open label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there clearly has been a need for these
randomized controlled trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also it's important for us to educate
our families and our medical colleagues
[SPEAKER_00]: that CBD is not medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is purified CBD that we've been using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have a lot to learn about
the various medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations, both with regard to
efficacy, safety, and tolerability in the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of what we have learned is
CBD may be effective and well-tolerated
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy treatment, some or many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And GW Pharmaceuticals, as we've
discussed, has the CBD purified from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and has these ongoing trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a company called Zanurba
Pharmaceuticals that has a transdermal CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're planning to trial in
refractory epilepsy, Fragile X,
[SPEAKER_00]: and osteoarthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think the big question is what
about other forms of medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really like to thank, this has been a
huge amount of effort for us over the past
[SPEAKER_00]: three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 80 kids either in the
expanded access program in these trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd really like to thank what I
used to call our CBD team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think of it as more of a village.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several of these people are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just in an extra 20 seconds,
I will tell my anecdotal story.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the kids who entered our first 25
was a little girl with myoclonic astatic
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had daily seizures ever since
developing epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd been on every medication we had that
could treat her seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had the Vegas nerve stimulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was on dietary therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she started CBD, she'd just gotten a
$14,000 seizure dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the parents tracked her progress in
the trial by pictures of the dog.

[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
