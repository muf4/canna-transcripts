[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of the CanMed Conference,
CanMed 24 returns the JW Marriott Resort
[SPEAKER_00]: in Marco Island, Florida, May 12th through
15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And registration opens October 6th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't miss this opportunity to learn from
and network with the industry's top
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers and innovators in one of the
most beautiful settings possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of exciting new additions to
the summit format that we will be
[SPEAKER_00]: announcing soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, there's no reason to wait to
register for the CanMed 24 Innovation and
[SPEAKER_00]: Investment Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you secure your spot
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because capacity is limited at the venue,

[SPEAKER_00]: So act now and take advantage of our early
bird pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to CanMedEvents.com to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Mitchell Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitch is a PhD candidate working for Dr.
Bruce Bugby in the Crop Physiology
[SPEAKER_00]: Laboratory at Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: His PhD research focuses on whole plant
physiology and cultivation of medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in controlled environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has published his research on
photobiology and plant nutrition in
[SPEAKER_00]: high-impact peer-reviewed scientific
journals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke with Mitch about the various
environmental factors that contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis yield, specifically light,
temperature, humidity, and CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitch does a great job explaining the
energy cascade, which is a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: describing the underlying mechanisms that
plants use to convert photons to energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and ultimately biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitch also explains how these factors can
be manipulated to not only increase yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also make better use of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed this conversation and I
expect we will see Mitchell on the CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: stage very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Mitch, I would like to thank this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's sponsor, Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at AdvancedNutrients.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without any further ado, please enjoy my
conversation with Mitchell Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Mitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to be on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we are going to explore the
different factors that contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you are a good person to talk to
because you've done a lot of research into
[SPEAKER_00]: these factors and you recently presented
some of your work at the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference out in Nevada, which is what
got you on my radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect we'll have a good conversation
about these factors and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we do that, I think it might be
wise to establish what we mean by yield
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think sometimes, and at least in
my mind, the term gets used
[SPEAKER_00]: interchangeably when talking about biomass
or the amount of flour the plant produces
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabinoid concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about yield,
which of those are you talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not both?
[SPEAKER_02]: With any crop plant, when we talk about
yield, we're talking about a harvestable
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: For tomatoes, it's the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: For wheat, it's the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: For cannabis, medical cannabis,
it's the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going for extraction,
you might be using all that biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, when we talk about yield,
we're talking about the mass of flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, one of the bigger issues is
all of the different metrics that are used
[SPEAKER_02]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll hear things like yield per plant or
yield per light, yield per fixture,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a standardized plant size or
a light source, then that can be useful,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for the most part, those don't really
tell you a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a big plant, small plant,
high-pressure sodium light versus an LED
[SPEAKER_02]: light?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take it one step further and say
yield per area, so grams per square foot,
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets us a little bit closer to being
able to compare and see how different
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities are functioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, even with that yield per area,
did it take you eight weeks to get that
[SPEAKER_02]: yield, but it took you 10 weeks,
so there's the time component in there
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that we're really trying to push
is this concept of photon conversion
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about how efficiently a crop
of cannabis takes the light that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: given and converts it into flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to get in today,
and we can break up that photon conversion
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency into smaller components to try
and untangle some of these environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when we're talking about cannabinoid
concentration, that's typically what we
[SPEAKER_02]: would call quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those things are important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yield for quality, sometimes you're
willing to sacrifice a little bit of yield
[SPEAKER_02]: if you can get your cannabinoid
concentration a little bit higher,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's the distinction for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yield is flower mass, quality is the
cannabinoid concentration or the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a good point in that it's
dependent on what your goals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in some cases, if you're looking
to extract the cannabinoids, then I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: the yield would be the amount of
cannabinoids contained in the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, the cannabinoid yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: As with everything, and I'm a scientist,
so I'm really hesitant to speak in
[SPEAKER_02]: absolute, but it always depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: What capabilities do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your limitations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, what are you striving for?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of depends in there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you made reference to this idea of how
well the plant converts the photons into
[SPEAKER_00]: actual flower and that there's a number of
different mechanisms that contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dive in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis has just recently started to be
studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been illegal for so long,
but now research institutions are starting
[SPEAKER_02]: to get on board.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you'll hear all the time is,
we don't know anything about this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: because we haven't been able to study it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To some extent, that's true, but at the
same time, it's just a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know based on decades of research and
other crops, what the basic nutritional
[SPEAKER_02]: needs are, how they respond to CO2,
irrigation, water stress, things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Optimizing all of those things isn't
necessarily difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get all of the environmental
factors optimized, nutrition, CO2,
[SPEAKER_02]: watering, light becomes the limiting
factor for growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's remarkable about cannabis,
and we'll get into this a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can hog a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really likes exceptionally high light.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that perspective, nothing else is
limiting other than photons.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we efficiently convert those
photons into flowers, which is ultimately
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're going to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first thing that needs to happen,
and again, at this point, we're
[SPEAKER_02]: considering canopy, a big community of
cannabis plants rather than a single leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: or a single plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first thing that canopy has to do
is absorb those photons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a small plant that's not taking
up the entire ground area.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's photons that are just hitting the
floor and those aren't driving growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first step is capture those
photons.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk a little bit about how the
environment can influence that here in a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we've captured those photons,
some of them are going to be absorbed by
[SPEAKER_02]: non-photosynthetic pigments like
anthocyanins, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them get reflected.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the plants, they're green.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next step is how efficiently do we
take those photons and use them to drive
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis, to fix CO2 from the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step two is photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the next one is sometimes I'll
mention this in talks and sometimes I
[SPEAKER_02]: won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one is carbon use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't a very well-known metric,
but once the plants fix that carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: through CO2, some of it's going to be
respired again as CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got to make DNA, they've got to
make proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: The carbon use efficiency, this one's
really hard to change with the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's remarkably consistent across species
and environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants will respire in proportion to
how much CO2 they fix through
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last one is one that can be heavily
influenced by the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the last component that gets us to
yield, and that's carbon partitioning
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency or harvest index.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of that carbon that's fixed and
stored in biomass is put into the flowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ultimately what we're interested
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's great about these four components,
and we call it the energy cascade model,
[SPEAKER_02]: is we're following the energy from the
photons all the way down into the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an output over an input.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then with a little bit of behind the
scenes math and some units conversions,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can multiply all of these values
together and get that photon conversion
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has units of grams of flower per mole
of photons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody measures their PPFD in micromole
per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most people are familiar with the
concept of daily light integral,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the total amount of light that's
received over the course of a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ultimately how we arrive at that
value.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's great about this is it doesn't
matter how long you grew the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if it was 10,000 square
feet or 100,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This normalizes all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could start to compare across
facilities and how efficiently they're
[SPEAKER_02]: using the light to make the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I understand correctly, what you're
really driving at is to be able to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: if your input of light is x, you would
expect at the end to get an output of y,
[SPEAKER_00]: correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great point because when we
arrive at this photon conversion
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency, grams per mole, we can take
whatever DLI we plan to input and multiply
[SPEAKER_02]: it by that value to get the expected yield
or theoretical yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can start to put numbers to these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that photon conversion efficiency
isn't a very well-known metric,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just to give you some perspective,
for cannabis, we typically see something
[SPEAKER_02]: between 0.2 and 0.3 grams per mole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, with some math and some units
conversions, you can take a DLI input and
[SPEAKER_02]: predict what your yield should be in grams
per square meter or grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if by the end, your output isn't what
you expected, you could trace things back
[SPEAKER_00]: and see where your leakage was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go back to those four components
and say, was my photon capture low?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was the photosynthetic efficiency low?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was there something else limiting like
water or nutrients or CO2, something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really elegant model, mostly for
its simplicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to talk about, I wish I had a
whiteboard so I could go through it and
[SPEAKER_02]: show the units.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a very simple way for us to start
to understand how the environment
[SPEAKER_02]: influences yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, if there is an effect of the
environment on yield, it has to come back
[SPEAKER_02]: to one of those four components.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it photon capture, photosynthetic
efficiency?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you have a good understanding of
that, you can get away from all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: snake oil claims that this product is
going to boost your yield by 40% on and
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ask yourself, which of these four
components is this product actually
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have to imagine that genetics play
a big role in this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all the different strains,
they're going to have different roles to
[SPEAKER_00]: play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the genetics, the two components that
it's most likely to influence is the
[SPEAKER_02]: photon capture efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a plant that spreads out
horizontally to capture more light?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it more of a tall, slender growth
habit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have thick leaves or thin leaves?
[SPEAKER_02]: That can have big effects on how
efficiently that crop is absorbing that
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the other one is carbon plantation
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some varieties just put more of that
carbon that they fix into flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them don't make a whole lot of
leaves and stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, some of them make a
whole lot of leaves and stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what we're necessarily
interested in when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: high value medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other two are really fundamentally
limited by physiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're well understood at the basic
biology level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics aren't going to have a huge
effect on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the environment affecting these
different underlying mechanisms?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could start with light or
whichever one you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with light.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're thinking about light and you
hinted at this earlier, there's three
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics that we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality or the spectrum, the color of
the lights, the quantity of the light or
[SPEAKER_02]: the intensity, and then there's also the
duration or the photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just pick out some of the highlights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with light quality,
so the colors of lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Photon capture, spectral quality can have
a big effect on photon capture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are starting to get a lot
more of this, but especially far red light
[SPEAKER_02]: has received a lot of attention over the
last few years, but it's well known to
[SPEAKER_02]: cause leaf expansion and increase photon
capture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, you also get a lot of stem
elongation along with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For cannabis, it's not often used for this
purpose, but for things like lettuce,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's extremely valuable to give them some
far red light so they expand and capture
[SPEAKER_02]: that light faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green light is an interesting one that's
also starting to get some more
[SPEAKER_02]: recognition.
[SPEAKER_02]: People typically think that green light
isn't used by plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that they're green, so they don't
absorb any of it, which is not in fact
[SPEAKER_02]: true.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do absorb and use green light for
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the valuable things about green
light is it can penetrate deeper into the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy, whereas red and blue light tends
to get absorbed on the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a whole bunch of stuff in the
middle that's not capturing any light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those green photons can penetrate deeper
and increase that photon capture a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the big ones with light quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of photosynthetic efficiency,
there's some small effects for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: part.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever heard of the McCree curve,
it's often cited as the relative
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthetic efficiency of different
colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under high light intensity, that tends to
be a pretty minor effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then going on to quantity, this one's an
interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's counterintuitive when we start to
think about photon inversion efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we think about the photosynthetic
efficiency, how much of those absorbed
[SPEAKER_02]: photons are the plants putting into
photosynthesis to fix carbon?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were to say to you, if I give my
plant more light, what's going to happen
[SPEAKER_02]: to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: The obvious answer is the yield is going
to go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we think about the efficiency with
which they're converting that light,
[SPEAKER_02]: it actually goes down with increasing
light intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The analogy that I like to use is,
imagine you're drinking from a faucet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get most of the water
that's coming out of that faucet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take the mouth right on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now imagine you've got a fire hose up to
your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quantity is way larger, and you might
be getting more on an absolute basis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're also wasting a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The efficiency with which you're ingesting
that water goes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the same for photosynthetic
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just dumping light on the plants,
and so the efficiency goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sweet spot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be giving it enough to
generate big flowers, but you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be wasteful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, it comes down to what is your
goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to maximize your yield per
square foot or your yield per area?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dump the light on that because that's
going to keep going up and up and up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested in maximizing the
efficiency, you've got to pay for those
[SPEAKER_02]: photons, for example, under electric
lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might try and find a sweet spot where
you're not wasting too much, but you're
[SPEAKER_02]: still getting high enough yield per square
foot to reach your goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the photo period, this is something
that's starting to be increasingly studied
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis for right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people still do the 12-12,
although there's been some nice papers
[SPEAKER_02]: that have been coming out that is starting
to challenge that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, this has the biggest effect on
carbon partitioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we give those plants a short day,
whether it's 12-12, 13-11, they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to start shifting that carbon into
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if we go less than 12 hours,
we might be shifting more of that carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: into the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then saving on those photons too,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll circle back to light quantity really
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, what's driving growth is the
daily light integral, the total amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: photons that are falling every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out here in Utah in the Western
United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get a lot of rain, but when we
do, we're not interested in how many
[SPEAKER_02]: raindrops are falling every single second.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to know how much we've got over
the course of the day, over the week,
[SPEAKER_02]: or over the entire year.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a variety that will still
flower under a longer photo period,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can give the plants a lower light
intensity, a lower PPFD for a longer
[SPEAKER_02]: period of time and get the same DLI,
but the photosynthetic efficiency is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be higher because they're under a lower
light intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're drinking from a faucet rather than
a fire hose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of potential to
start breeding for and selecting varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: that flower under a longer photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the auto flowers and things like
that, but I think there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: potential there to optimize both yield per
area as well as the yield efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the big ones with light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light is the sexiest of all the
environmental factors right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: like in nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, what we say is, if you want to
get high yields, give them high light.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, spectral quality has a
really small effect on, especially yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also on the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a good point that light is one of
the more popular, more well-known of these
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, are there misconceptions
or maybe false narratives that are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there in terms of light?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of those come down to
quality, to cannabinoid concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that's persisted since the 1980s
is this idea of UV.
[SPEAKER_02]: We published a paper earlier this year and
there's been some other papers that have
[SPEAKER_02]: come out of University of Wealth that have
really not been able to repeat the initial
[SPEAKER_02]: results that found that UV increased
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are starting to get on
board with that and starting to ditch the
[SPEAKER_02]: idea that UV is the magic bullet to give
your plants cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think generally speaking,
spectral quality gets too much focus and
[SPEAKER_02]: light intensity doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we always recommend is get a light
source that is, if you're growing under
[SPEAKER_02]: electric lights, get a light source that's
super efficient, gives you a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: photons but not a lot of energy,
and a light source that gives you a high
[SPEAKER_02]: output, a high photon output.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about the spectral quality so
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should really be focused on electrical
efficiency and that photon conversion
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting you say that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've dabbled with home cultivation a
little bit and I've definitely walked the
[SPEAKER_00]: floors of different trade shows and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the different light
manufacturers, it seems like they really
[SPEAKER_00]: focus in on the spectral quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the graphs and everything like
that, but you're saying that's not as
[SPEAKER_00]: important as just the amount of photons
that they're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of these lighting companies
are starting to see that, but with the way
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis industry is going,
prices are falling.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have got to start doing this more
efficiently, more cost effectively if they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to stay in business.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing under electric lights,
the only way that you're going to do that
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiently is by sourcing an efficient
light source that gives you a high photon
[SPEAKER_02]: output.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, it can maybe be some small
effects on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the analogy of a microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever been in science class,
you've got a coarse focus knob and that
[SPEAKER_02]: gets you up and down and close to where
you need to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you've got a fine focus knob to dial
it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fine focus knob is the spectral
quality that can maybe have a small
[SPEAKER_02]: effect, but really that efficiency in the
photon output is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: With light too, and something that you
mentioned earlier, was this idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: broader leaves or plants that spread out
and can absorb more light could
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretically convert more of that into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the practice of pruning or
lollipopping plants to increase flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another thing that's really a hot
topic in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: People love to prune their plants and I
get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to be hands-on with my plants too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think oftentimes the de-leafing is over
and done.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can look underneath your prop of
cannabis and you can see light coming
[SPEAKER_02]: through it, that means you're wasting
photons.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, if you can pinch and
manipulate your plants to encourage them
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow out while still keeping that sea
of green as they call it, you can force
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants to capture more of those
photons, which will end up with a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other way you can do that is with
planting density.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see all the time people start out with
really small plants that are super space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a lot of light there early on
that's just falling on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give your plants a shorter veg,
pack them in there, prune them and pinch
[SPEAKER_02]: them to keep them short and to fill that
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You automatically start out with a higher
photon capture.
[SPEAKER_02]: More of that light is being absorbed,
more of it's going into the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: These cultural techniques are another way
to influence these four components.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it comes down to one of those four
components for the most part of its photon
[SPEAKER_02]: capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it was always explained to me was
that you want to get rid of those big fan
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves to get more light to the actual bud
sites to grow those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense or does the plant
really care or is it just going to convert
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever energy it absorbs from those
leaves to all the flowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's emerging evidence that flowers
that are lower in the canopy that have
[SPEAKER_02]: been shaded the entire time can have a
lower cannabinoid concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen it in our lab and I know that
other people have seen it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is something to delivering
light to those flowers in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: maximize the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing to keep in mind is that you can
make sure that you have all of your
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers at the top of the canopy absorbing
the light without sacrificing photon
[SPEAKER_02]: capture.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we do and a lot of
people are starting to do is a relatively
[SPEAKER_02]: short veg period and then multiple pinches
even after 10 to 14 days of short days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, what that does is spread the canopy
out and it promotes more numerous but
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller flower buds at the top of the
canopy that are absorbing the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: A single leaf can absorb like 95 percent
of the protons that hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you've got flowers that are down low
in that canopy, even if the PTFE is 1,000
[SPEAKER_02]: at the top of the canopy, those plants
might only be seen in 50 micromoles at
[SPEAKER_02]: most.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just not enough for them to sustain
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there is something to it,
but I still think the focus should be on
[SPEAKER_02]: maximizing that photon capture,
not removing too many of those fan leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: and just promoting more numerous smaller
flower buds at the top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are more spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of going three-dimensional
vertically, try to keep it all one level
[SPEAKER_00]: spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people do that right now
with the netting and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fine way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the goal is maximizing that photon
capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess moving on from light, how about
temperature?
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature is a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the focus of my dissertation and
this is one of those things in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: that just hasn't been studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the reason for that, it's really
hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to do temperature studies,
you've got to have separate chambers,
[SPEAKER_02]: separate rooms, separate aerial
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fortunate at our lab to have some
really good facilities and great growth
[SPEAKER_02]: chambers to do these temperature studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we go back to our four components,
photon capture, I think this one is
[SPEAKER_02]: intuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you increase the temperature,
the plants grow faster, they absorb more
[SPEAKER_02]: light early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: High temperature early on is great to
increase that photon capture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get through these and then we'll talk
about this idea of changing environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions throughout the life cycle,
which you hinted at earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that high temperature early on is
great to help increase that photon
[SPEAKER_02]: capture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, high temperatures force plants to
just move super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that does is, I don't want to say
damage, but it just makes the machinery
[SPEAKER_02]: tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the life cycle, if you keep
that temperature hot, the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency starts to go down pretty
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are just tired and you're
pushing them too hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Low temperature late in the life cycle has
the potential to keep that photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency high.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are still fixing carbon,
still putting it into the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, what I recommend is high
temperatures early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that means is going to depend on what
you can do and the varieties that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But high temperature until that canopy
closes, the plants are absorbing all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the light and then bring that temperature
down to preserve that photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I've seen in my
studies is that in addition to high
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature increase in photon capture,
it helps to promote carbon partitioning to
[SPEAKER_02]: the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants need some base temperature
early on in order to set those flowers and
[SPEAKER_02]: just start developing those valuable
inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high temperature early on both
increases photon capture and carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: partitioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the other things that I've seen,
and I don't think people think about a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole lot, is those flower buds at the top
of the canopy are just big dense clusters
[SPEAKER_02]: of mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a lot of evaporative
cooling like the leaf does.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get really, really hot,
six, seven, eight degrees Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_02]: warmer than the air temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of all of the environmental factors that
I've studied, temperature has the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: effect on an anabinoid concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen at high temperatures that the
anabinoids just go through the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the reason for that is the flower
buds are always warmer than air
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the HPS, they can be 10 degrees
Fahrenheit warmer than the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you've got a nice 70, 72,
air temperature, the flowers are 82,
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that the low temperature
latent life cycle does is help to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: that flower temperature low and preserve
the photosynthetic machinery and the
[SPEAKER_02]: machinery needed to synthesize those
anabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That aligns with the lore, or at least
what I've heard in terms of growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that you want to have low temperatures
during flower, and that's going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you more frosty buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the anabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the nice purple color at the end
if you go low enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of potential to use
temperature and manipulate it throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the life cycle to achieve whatever goal
you want to achieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of yield, again, it comes back to
those four components for the capture
[SPEAKER_02]: bloom that they just wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk about high temperature,
low temperature, what are we talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of the ranges there?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where people usually get
frustrated with me, and I get frustrated
[SPEAKER_02]: too, because the answer is it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to enough scientists to know
if you want to state that answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature is not only the thing that
I've seen have a biggest effect on
[SPEAKER_02]: anabinoids, it's also the thing that I've
seen most variable among varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some cultivars where the
anabinoids start to plummet at an air
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature of 72, 74, something like
that, so not terribly hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there are others that can go up into
the 80s, and they're just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends, but generally,
what I say, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in maximizing the anabinoids,
is air on the cold side rather than the
[SPEAKER_02]: hot side.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go one degree too warm,
you might be screwed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go one degree too cool,
it might not be that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially during the flowering part,
I assume, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, especially once those flower buds
start to form, they're at the top of the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're absorbing a lot of energy,
a lot of heat, and they just get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about humidity?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot of people talking about
crop steering with BPD and with humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another one of those things that
in my mind is overly focused on in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest thing that humidity has an
effect on is disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you start to get really crazy and
you've got 20% humidity and 80 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: certain height, then things might start to
get a little bit stressful for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, humidity has a
small effect on growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it can have some pretty big indirect
effects, and the biggest one is on
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants cool themselves by evaporating
water just like we cool ourselves by
[SPEAKER_02]: evaporating sweat.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a humid environment, the plants can't
transpire as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't cool themselves as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you've got a high humidity or a low
vapor pressure deficit, those flower buds
[SPEAKER_02]: can get even warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest effects of humidity are really
an indirect effect of temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try and look at all of these different
environmental factors piece by piece,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in reality, they're all interact with
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a very simple, straightforward
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The back and forth between humidity and
temperature, I think, should be focused on
[SPEAKER_02]: more and less on you got to get a BPD of
1.2 for week one and then 1.25 for week
[SPEAKER_02]: three and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sort of understanding what effects
humidity can have is going to get you a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot further than trying to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that makes sense that humidity
might not have a direct effect on yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the topic of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know from our perspective,
too, medicinal genomics, we deal a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: with microbials and plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that humidity can play a big role
in particularly mold, which I would
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine if the plant's infected with mold,
it's going to compromise your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can't stop that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the biggest thing that humidity
does.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best way to deal with that and ensure
that you're not growing those molds is to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that you've got good airflow
through that canopy to blow out any humid
[SPEAKER_02]: air and prevent those sort of
microclimates from forming around the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower buds and the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what about CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of growers kind of
supplement their CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And CO2, this kind of comes down again to
basic plant physiology, the fundamental
[SPEAKER_02]: processes of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carbon gets fixed with a little bit of
water and goes to sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously CO2 enrichment helps to
increase yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is another thing that's not well
studied in cannabis right now for the same
[SPEAKER_02]: reason as temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to have separate chambers,
separate rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a couple of preliminary studies
on CO2 going all the way up to 1500 ppm,
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, once you get up to about a
ppfe of a thousand, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 concentration of a thousand ppm,
you don't really get any more increase in
[SPEAKER_02]: yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And going from ambient to a thousand,
you might increase yield by about 30%,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is actually consistent with most
other crop species that have been studied
[SPEAKER_02]: in response to CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main component that that's
affecting is the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just more CO2 available for the
plants to fix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, since we were just talking about
interactions and temperature, CO2 is very
[SPEAKER_02]: much like humidity in that it can have
indirect effects on temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the plants are in a high CO2
environment, they close their stomates,
[SPEAKER_02]: the little pores on the leaves where CO2
goes in and water comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need to have quite as open
because there's a whole bunch of CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that does is reduce the
evaporative cooling at the leaf surface
[SPEAKER_02]: until your canopy and your flower
temperature gets hotter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I think it's great to enrich
with CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always do enrich with CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reduces water use.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole bunch of benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got to think about it in the
context of all of your other environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: To make sure that you're co-optimizing all
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I definitely want to be respectful
of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already spent a lot of time talking
about this, but before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you've mentioned that there's
a lot of these different environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors and some of them haven't been as
well studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that you're working on now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we anticipate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I'm in my fourth year of my PhD,
so I'm hoping to get out of here soon and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a lot of data on temperature that
I think is going to be extremely valuable
[SPEAKER_02]: for the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I'm really looking forward to getting
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that we've done a lot of
in our lab that's very unique is
[SPEAKER_02]: measurements of canopy photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can watch plants fix carbon and
respire carbon continuously throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that allows us to do is separate
some of these four components and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: was this an effect on photon capture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a direct effect on photosynthetic
efficiency?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can start to really take apart these
environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in my opinion, I think the biggest
thing that's going to come out is all of
[SPEAKER_02]: this temperature data.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I talk anecdotally to growers
and they'll say, yeah, we had a string of
[SPEAKER_02]: hot days in the greenhouse and our
cannabinoids went through the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's just no data on it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's going to be
valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that we're doing is,
you know, I talked about how this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: just loves my little hog light all day
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to figure out where that
upper limit is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just did a study going up to a DLI of
like 100 moles per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there have been some
commercial companies and lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: companies that have done similar stuff,
but we've got data that the yield
[SPEAKER_02]: continues to go up to 70, 80 moles a day,
which is like 30% higher than anything you
[SPEAKER_02]: would ever see in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Practically, you may not ever want to do
that in your facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's expensive to get to 100 moles a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But physiologically, there's a lot of
interesting things that we can learn about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and use it sort of as a model
prop to understand the limits of plant
[SPEAKER_02]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you'll have some data out
and you'll submit an abstract and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see you present some of that at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I let you go, I want to give you
an opportunity to share with the audience
[SPEAKER_00]: any ways to maybe get in touch with you or
read more about some of the work that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've done.
