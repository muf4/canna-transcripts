[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for coming get this
microphone adjusted a little bit Today
[SPEAKER_07]: we're gonna explore cannabis within pro
sports and in particular as a viable
[SPEAKER_07]: alternative for pain management and pain
relief As an alternative obviously to
[SPEAKER_07]: opiates My name is Jim McAlpine to give
you just a very quick background on myself
[SPEAKER_07]: The 420 games are an advocacy running
around the country where we go four point
[SPEAKER_07]: two miles to change the perception of
cannabis as stoners and show that athletes
[SPEAKER_07]: and You know Jeff Sessions good people do
use cannabis It's
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing honor to be here today at Harvard
I've spoken recently at the Mill Valley
[SPEAKER_07]: Film Festival I was at the Super Bowl with
some of these guys and we just did South
[SPEAKER_07]: by Southwest But being at a prestigious
place like this is really really moving
[SPEAKER_07]: the needle So it's exciting for all of us
to help spread some knowledge here from
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go into the panel and Why don't
we just go down the line?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like for these guys to give their Own
introduction instead of me reading theirs
[SPEAKER_07]: and you guys why don't you say who you
are?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know your background and also I think
it's important why you're here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just give a little tidbit on that as well
Start with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Nathan.
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is David Nathan.
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a psychiatrist writer educator from
Princeton, New Jersey originally from
[SPEAKER_15]: Philadelphia I did my residency up here At
Harvard and so it's good to be back.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the president board president and
founder of doctors for cannabis regulation
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is the nation's first and only?
[SPEAKER_15]: National organization for the regulation
legalization taxation of cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States Dr. Perry Solomon a board
certified anesthesiologist and chief
[SPEAKER_00]: medical officer at hello MD we're a Health
of digital health and wellness platform
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows patients of members from all
over the world to ask questions on our
[SPEAKER_00]: site that's by other patients about what
cannabis products work for them by
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians to give them recommendations as
well as from professional people who
[SPEAKER_00]: product manufacturers about what products
they have we also do telehealth
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluations in California and other states
that allow telehealth evaluations for
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are interested in getting their
cannabis recommendations for their medical
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions we have about 170,000 members
and issued about 60,000 recommendations in
[SPEAKER_14]: the past two years Hi everybody,
I'm Evan Britton I played six years in the
[SPEAKER_14]: NFL four years with the Jacksonville
Jaguars two years with the Chicago Bears
[SPEAKER_14]: as an offensive lineman Tackle guard and a
little bit of tight end at the end just
[SPEAKER_14]: for starters.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm here to Try to grab the air of the NFL
and start to look at cannabis as an
[SPEAKER_14]: alternative to opiates and prescription
anti-inflammatories as well as what it can
[SPEAKER_14]: do and be as a solution to concussions in
CTE.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my name is Nate Jackson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I played six years also in the NFL all for
the Denver Broncos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some Bronco fans in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: No Bears fans are Jacksonville.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I played six years receiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got I was a receiver and a tight end
and throughout my career I used cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: as medication to deal with the variety of
injuries that I had when I would get hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oftentimes a career I'm sorry a season
ending injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hand me a bottle of pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went home and instead consumed cannabis
to deal with my injuries and found that I
[SPEAKER_02]: healed much faster than when I did it with
pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it just got me thinking and after
retirement I started writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am also a writer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've written two books about my experience
in the NFL and I was honest about the
[SPEAKER_02]: different medications that I preferred and
that that's led me here because I believe
[SPEAKER_02]: that football players current and former
need to arm themselves with this
[SPEAKER_02]: information if they're going to be able to
stand up for themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Lance Johnstone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Play 11 years six with Oakland and five
with the Minnesota Vikings.
[SPEAKER_06]: After I retired from the NFL went in as a
broker at Merrill Lynch from there I
[SPEAKER_06]: started doing some angel investing and
ventures.
[SPEAKER_06]: So currently we are part of an accelerator
for cannabis companies and I'm here today
[SPEAKER_06]: to you know to continue to help push
awareness and you know educate help
[SPEAKER_06]: educate not only some of my fellow
athletes but anyone that's dealing with
[SPEAKER_06]: pain as an alternative more natural
alternative to you know opioids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my name is Ricky Williams and all you
Patriots fans should know who I am.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I used to come up here every year
when I played for the Dolphins also played
[SPEAKER_08]: for the Saints and my last year was with
the Baltimore Ravens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here because I'm the captain of the
NFL all cannabis team and yeah that was a
[SPEAKER_08]: joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know so I was a joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I'm here to tell my story.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know back in 2002.
[SPEAKER_08]: 2003 2004 I failed a couple of drug tests
and almost ended my career and I was
[SPEAKER_08]: looking back at some articles written at
the time and and what everyone is talking
[SPEAKER_08]: about now I was saying that back then.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you know it's real.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I'm a I'm a living breathing
example of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I led the NFL in rushing in 2002 using
cannabis instead of opioids instead of
[SPEAKER_08]: indiscent and toward all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I know it works and that's why I'm
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give them all a hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look we know doctors are smart because
they're doctors but at least they think
[SPEAKER_07]: they are sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a joke.
[SPEAKER_07]: But these other guys are incredibly
intelligent as well and really all four of
[SPEAKER_07]: these guys I respect obviously as athletes
and as men but all four of these guys I've
[SPEAKER_07]: gotten to know and are really really
intelligent guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a pleasure for me to be able to
moderate a panel with the quality we have
[SPEAKER_07]: right here today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So really you can break down the main
applications of cannabis within both pro
[SPEAKER_07]: sports and really all athletics in my
opinion to two things and it's it's focus
[SPEAKER_07]: and recovery are the main applications.
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally I'm I'm kind of more of an
extreme sports guy and I like to use
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis for focus and I talk about that a
lot normally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we'll dive in at the end but today
we're really going to have more of a laser
[SPEAKER_07]: focus on both the NFL guys at the at the
pro level and an alternative to opioid in
[SPEAKER_07]: the recovery realm of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know NFL is a brutal game extremely
violent causes severe injuries even to the
[SPEAKER_07]: strongest of men and injury is the biggest
problem an NFL team faces they're looking
[SPEAKER_07]: how do we keep these guys on the field
oftentimes not thinking about the person
[SPEAKER_07]: that's behind that number.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really that's why we're here today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I looked at it I was walking with Nate
and they were telling me what happens when
[SPEAKER_07]: you get cut you get a little tap on the
shoulder and they throw a bag at you and
[SPEAKER_07]: you get your stuff out of the locker room
and you're gone you know and really I feel
[SPEAKER_07]: like they're looked at as machines and you
know you can replace these parts and get
[SPEAKER_07]: them back on the field but when it's too
expensive boom we just get a new machine
[SPEAKER_07]: and the human being right there is lost
and that kind of disgusts me about the NFL
[SPEAKER_07]: to be honest and again why we're here
today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know the moral dilemma for these
guys is hey do I do whatever it takes and
[SPEAKER_07]: shove these pills down my throat because
the NFL is telling me I have to or do I do
[SPEAKER_07]: what it takes to go home to my family and
have you know my brain be intact later on
[SPEAKER_07]: in life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Nate why don't you tell us about I
think it's an interesting story just how
[SPEAKER_07]: drug testing in the NFL works and then in
particular when you get caught what
[SPEAKER_07]: happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let Ricky talk about when you get
caught.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was gonna say shouldn't that be my
question I'll talk about I have a PhD in
[SPEAKER_02]: the drug program yeah I'll talk about how
you beat it and then he'll talk about how
[SPEAKER_02]: what it's like when you get caught but
it's actually so the NFL drug testing
[SPEAKER_02]: comes in two facets one is for street
drugs and one is for performance enhancing
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The street drugs like cannabis and like
other party drugs is a once a year test
[SPEAKER_02]: and it happens typically in May June or
June or July somewhere around mini camps
[SPEAKER_02]: or training camps and if you pass that one
test then you're good for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: year and you don't get tested again and so
guys you know abstain in advance of the
[SPEAKER_02]: test and then once they pass that then
they can use it during the season to
[SPEAKER_02]: medicate but for guys who get caught up in
the drug program the drug testing or the
[SPEAKER_02]: drug substance abuse program like he'll
talk about it's two three four times every
[SPEAKER_02]: week you get tested all year long for
multiple years of clean tests before
[SPEAKER_02]: you're pulled off of that and so it's
those guys who get put in those programs
[SPEAKER_02]: who can't use it and are given more
dangerous alternatives instead the
[SPEAKER_02]: substance I'm sorry the performance
enhancing drugs happen all year long it
[SPEAKER_02]: can happen in the offseason it happened
one time to me in the offseason and their
[SPEAKER_02]: protocol is when they truck when they test
you you have to remove your shirt pull
[SPEAKER_02]: your pants below your knees and they have
to stand perpendicular to you and watch
[SPEAKER_02]: the urine exit your body that's what they
do and so they came to my parents house in
[SPEAKER_02]: San Jose in the offseason and came into
the bathroom that I grew up in and stood
[SPEAKER_02]: there and watched me pee in a cup so it is
a little bit of an objectification going
[SPEAKER_02]: on but I never got I never tested positive
and so I was able to use it during the
[SPEAKER_02]: season whereas Ricky can talk about what
happens when you get caught up in the
[SPEAKER_08]: system I tested positive and I still
continue to use it throughout the season
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually working on an article right
now for marijuana calm about how to pass a
[SPEAKER_08]: drug test although I failed for I passed
probably 400 500 tests so when you when
[SPEAKER_08]: you get caught in them in the NFL's
substance of abuse program you get a
[SPEAKER_08]: letter in the mail that says you're gonna
go through stage one to determine if you
[SPEAKER_08]: have a substance abuse problem and so they
send you they sent me to Atlanta and I
[SPEAKER_08]: spent a whole day met with three different
psychiatrists filled all this paperwork
[SPEAKER_08]: just so that they can tell me that I have
a substance abuse problem but no matter
[SPEAKER_08]: what the psychiatrists say you have a
substance abuse problem and they put you
[SPEAKER_08]: in a drug treatment program with the NFL
for for two years and if you stay clean
[SPEAKER_08]: for two years you're out of that you're
out of the program and someone and what
[SPEAKER_08]: happened to me is I was playing for for
New Orleans in the New Orleans they tested
[SPEAKER_08]: in training camp which was in late July
and then I got traded to Miami and in
[SPEAKER_08]: Miami they tested in May and I didn't get
the memo so I was in the drug program and
[SPEAKER_08]: and you know it's like Nate was saying I
hated it when I first got in I was I was
[SPEAKER_08]: actually excited about the opportunity to
talk to someone because part of the
[SPEAKER_08]: program is they give you someone to talk
to you once a week and a mandatory hour
[SPEAKER_08]: and and then when I went to talk to him
all he talked to me about was how to not
[SPEAKER_08]: fail a drug test all right and then I was
tested nine times a month and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: wherever I go in the world I have to call
the NFL before I leave before I get on a
[SPEAKER_08]: plane and say I'm going I'll be at this
address for this long this is when I
[SPEAKER_08]: arrived this is when I leave and at the
address I give them no other address they
[SPEAKER_08]: can call me anytime they want and I have
four hours to pee in a cup from that time
[SPEAKER_08]: at that location so it's very stressful
especially when you know failing a second
[SPEAKER_08]: drug test you're fined one-fourth of your
salary another test you're suspended four
[SPEAKER_08]: games so it's very stressful even even
when I wasn't using cannabis it was
[SPEAKER_08]: stressful because if I couldn't get to
that location in four hours you know it
[SPEAKER_08]: was tough and I think right now the NFL is
moving to the NFL Players Association is
[SPEAKER_08]: moving to propose that cannabis is taken
off the the banned substance list and
[SPEAKER_08]: recognizing that it's not as an abuse
problem but it's a health issue and and
[SPEAKER_08]: research even though there hasn't been
that much has come to the point where
[SPEAKER_08]: where D'Amore Smith the executive director
of the of our union has finally like
[SPEAKER_08]: hopped on board and said okay there's
something we have there's a we have to
[SPEAKER_08]: look at this differently and finally the
union is taking a step forward to to have
[SPEAKER_08]: the players back and I think that's a step
in the right direction to change this
[SPEAKER_08]: antiquated punitive drug program that
doesn't help players just punishes them
[SPEAKER_08]: for taking for trying to take care of
themselves yeah and you know yeah let's
[SPEAKER_07]: give them a hand it's I'll take it however
we can get it it's a little sad to me
[SPEAKER_07]: watching and really seeing that it's it's
a numbers game to them it's not really to
[SPEAKER_07]: me from what I'm seeing about the people
but when you show them that this stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: actually will save you money you know on
opioids and and actually have your players
[SPEAKER_07]: in better shape that's what they really
care about and and that's the whole point
[SPEAKER_07]: here this stuff does work and it's a very
very viable alternative to give you just
[SPEAKER_07]: some quick data 33,000 Americans die every
year of opioid overdoses that's a that's a
[SPEAKER_07]: big number and that's a number that does
not have to happen NFL players are over
[SPEAKER_07]: four times as likely to become addicted to
painkillers so what the point I I wanted
[SPEAKER_07]: to come out of that story is also once
you're caught once now you're pigeon-holed
[SPEAKER_07]: into having those pills shoved down your
throat because you have zero other
[SPEAKER_07]: alternatives to quitting and I mean Ricky
you pretty much did quit and and walk away
[SPEAKER_07]: from it so that's why I got a lot of
respect for that and I feel bad for these
[SPEAKER_07]: guys that are still having that happen so
that's why I'm here today I want to see
[SPEAKER_07]: that change so we're gonna get into some
other stuff empirical data charts and
[SPEAKER_07]: start letting the doctors of backup our
stories here but is is there any stories
[SPEAKER_07]: that you guys want to tell that are in
particular one that's very quick to me
[SPEAKER_07]: that just rings of there's a problem here
at the Super Bowl there's a commercial for
[SPEAKER_07]: something called OIC it's opioid-induced
constipation so if you can't go poop move
[SPEAKER_07]: antique yeah there we go if you can't go
poop with your opiates we've got another
[SPEAKER_07]: pill for you to take and man did when's
the third one gonna come out so any
[SPEAKER_07]: stories that you guys got that that kind
of you want to share with the audience
[SPEAKER_07]: that exemplify these issues or did we
already kind of go through that I'll share
[SPEAKER_14]: some stuff so you know really the process
in football is just a daily process of
[SPEAKER_14]: managing these highly potent
anti-inflammatories that wreak havoc on
[SPEAKER_14]: your digestive system your kidney and
liver you know taking opiates before the
[SPEAKER_14]: game day before the game before the game
after the game day after the game this is
[SPEAKER_14]: how you're getting out of pain and it's
you know basically just this vicious cycle
[SPEAKER_14]: and for me really the painkillers the
opiates they made me feel insane they made
[SPEAKER_14]: my mind crazy they made me really angry
towards my girlfriend at the time my wife
[SPEAKER_14]: now towards my mother the people that were
trying to care for me and these really
[SPEAKER_14]: vulnerable times of injury you know I
wasn't able to function you know I wasn't
[SPEAKER_14]: able to do anything these things made it
difficult to sleep I was waking up at
[SPEAKER_14]: three o'clock in the morning with
withdrawal symptoms if any of you have
[SPEAKER_14]: ever experienced that something like a
knife twisting in your gut cold sweat
[SPEAKER_14]: chills all the above you feel nuts
juxtaposing that experience to my
[SPEAKER_14]: experience when I consumed cannabis was
very healing it relaxed me it eased my
[SPEAKER_14]: anxiety and my depression made it easier
to sleep ease the pain in my physical body
[SPEAKER_14]: as well as rejuvenated me emotionally and
spiritually and gave me the energy and the
[SPEAKER_14]: fulfillment I needed to go out the next
day and play and do it again at a hundred
[SPEAKER_14]: percent because every single day you've
got to be out there ready to give it
[SPEAKER_14]: everything you've got in practice let
alone Sunday so cannabis can be a very
[SPEAKER_14]: profound solution to those things and
thanks in
[SPEAKER_07]: some layman's terms and then I want to
hand this over to the doctors but the way
[SPEAKER_07]: I see this is I've been on both I'm an
athlete I'm not a pro athlete but I've
[SPEAKER_07]: been hurt pretty bad many times and I've
been on opioids and my bad back is an
[SPEAKER_07]: example and what really people need to do
is start looking at their their whole body
[SPEAKER_07]: strengthening themselves looking at more
of an Eastern philosophy on some levels of
[SPEAKER_07]: taking care of your body versus putting a
pill in it to fix fix your body and
[SPEAKER_07]: opioids had always for me I'm a little out
of pain but I want to lie in my bed and
[SPEAKER_07]: not don't want to do shit really to put it
bluntly and when when I take cannabis I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: able to both be out of pain but also
mentally not have that fog that allows me
[SPEAKER_07]: to work out and kind of reiterating what
Evan said there so it allows us to still
[SPEAKER_07]: work out and be athletic and strengthen
the pieces of our body whether we're pro
[SPEAKER_07]: or average Joe to get healthy versus just
relying on a pill and now as we go to the
[SPEAKER_07]: doctors I will show a short here in a
minute but what I'd like to do is have Dr.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nathan and Dr. Solomon explain cannabidiol
CBD is what most people know it as and
[SPEAKER_07]: also the endocannabinoid system which is a
pretty interesting thing I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: physicians don't even hear about this
through medical school just because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of a hidden thing but it is in with
all within all of us so you guys want to
[SPEAKER_07]: split it up and one of you talk a little
bit about CBD and the other about the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system well one thing that
you mentioned that I think needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: brought out about education and how the
medical system is essentially ignoring the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole issue and doctors are coming out of
medical school even from you know probably
[SPEAKER_00]: or across the street completely ignorant
about the endocannabinoid system and out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the hundred and forty four medical
schools in the country one teaches a
[SPEAKER_00]: course on the endocannabinoid system and
about 13 percent of the other hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: forty four mention it in passing so a lot
of the times the physicians are coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of medical school knowing absolutely
nothing about this whole wonderful system
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps protect the body CBD THC etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's just that they come out not
knowing anything about it so we encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: all the physicians who are here and this
is a great venue to be able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced to what's going on and that it
really is a science and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system has been around
since the night or discovered in the 1970s
[SPEAKER_00]: and it really does work to help
inflammation to help fight pain and it
[SPEAKER_00]: just needs to be used by many more
physicians and I understand there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue about a doctor recommending it in
terms of a player comes and sits there and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's in pain and there's a prescription
pad and one of them is for an opioid
[SPEAKER_00]: that's measurable it's easy you're right
one pill or two pills take this it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: known dose etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: the other side says well here's cannabis
well what are you right how can you
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly tell someone what to do it's a
very individualistic mechanism that works
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not the same for every single
person so there's an education process for
[SPEAKER_00]: the physician to understand what's going
on it starts with medical school and
[SPEAKER_15]: continues in places like this and actually
I would love to pick up on that thread
[SPEAKER_15]: talking about education it was in medical
school where I think I was turned from a
[SPEAKER_15]: drug warrior as we all grew up or at least
those of us who were in the just-say-no
[SPEAKER_15]: generation and thinking that drugs are bad
and the people who use them are bad and
[SPEAKER_15]: the people who sell them are worse and
unworthy of their freedom and as I
[SPEAKER_15]: proceeded through my residency in
psychiatry where I studied a lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: substance abuse I was really shocked that
my teachers in a highly respected
[SPEAKER_15]: residency program were very much for the
drug war and I'm thinking you're trying to
[SPEAKER_15]: help these people you're trying to help
these individuals who are struggling with
[SPEAKER_15]: substances and you still want to punish
them do you think that's really going to
[SPEAKER_15]: help them and you know as Russell Brand
said if being in an alley with some smelly
[SPEAKER_15]: people in injecting yourself with God
knows what using shared needles if that's
[SPEAKER_15]: not enough to make you stop the threat of
the law putting you in a room where you
[SPEAKER_15]: get food three times a day and you get to
shower and all of that that's it that's
[SPEAKER_15]: not going to stop you and I couldn't
understand why my teachers didn't
[SPEAKER_15]: understand that and then as I proceeded
through my career as a psychiatrist as a
[SPEAKER_15]: general adult psychiatrist in central New
Jersey I started seeing how lives were
[SPEAKER_15]: being wrecked by marijuana and virtually
none of them were because of the effects
[SPEAKER_15]: of the drug it was because of the effects
of the law and that's what really got me
[SPEAKER_15]: thinking that's
[SPEAKER_15]: what got me thinking that I think I need
to do something about this it was
[SPEAKER_15]: bothering me so much especially because I
would think back to those teachers of mine
[SPEAKER_15]: and what how they wanted to handle even
something like marijuana and I realized
[SPEAKER_15]: that this is and this is an issue of
ethics morality and of course it's an
[SPEAKER_15]: issue of the law because of the way the
laws are written and I started getting
[SPEAKER_15]: involved in this realized that there was
no forum for doctors to speak out
[SPEAKER_15]: comfortably in public about this issue and
I know that because I did it and found out
[SPEAKER_15]: what happens when you do that I wrote an
op-ed for the Wall Street Journal in 2010
[SPEAKER_15]: that's really what got the whole thing
started for me and when realizing that
[SPEAKER_15]: there was no organizing force that's when
I came up with the idea for doctors for
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis regulation look up at DFCR you
can see our declaration of principles that
[SPEAKER_15]: was signed almost exactly a year ago and
it was not long after that that somebody
[SPEAKER_15]: who is not in this room Eugene Monroe who
some of you may know as actually a very
[SPEAKER_15]: effective advocate among NFLers and he
actually was the first active NFL player
[SPEAKER_15]: to come out after which he was cut had the
opportunity to continue playing but
[SPEAKER_15]: decided his body had had enough and came
to DFCR and said look you know doctors and
[SPEAKER_15]: players we can actually bring this message
to the public in a really effective way
[SPEAKER_15]: and he said that we'll open the door and
you guys go through and I think what
[SPEAKER_15]: you're seeing on this stage right now with
these four fantastic and eloquent
[SPEAKER_15]: individuals telling their stories and
sharing what they've learned about
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis and us being able to back it up
with some of the science and I know you
[SPEAKER_15]: asked about science this has been a highly
effective campaign that we launched in
[SPEAKER_15]: November of last year doctors and players
for NFL cannabis reform and a couple of
[SPEAKER_15]: days after we launched the campaign the
NFL on its website as my son who loves
[SPEAKER_15]: following everything football was pointing
out ran its first article saying that you
[SPEAKER_15]: know we've said that doctor that the NFL
isn't going to take any action until our
[SPEAKER_15]: doctors tell us it's okay right you know
the doctors that they pay are going to
[SPEAKER_15]: tell them you know what what they think if
that means changing the status quo and and
[SPEAKER_15]: the players who sorry lost my training of
thought I haven't spoken in front of a
[SPEAKER_15]: group this big in a very long time this is
a cannabis talk so you know we can
[SPEAKER_07]: occasionally it's not bad and you know
what I want to bring it back because I do
[SPEAKER_15]: want to bring it back it's when you know
when Lance said that he wanted to share
[SPEAKER_15]: some stuff the analogies never end I think
a lot of you know right cannabidiol is
[SPEAKER_15]: mostly a CBD I'm sorry is mostly a
cannabinoid receptor antagonist and it
[SPEAKER_15]: does it in such a way which is of course
complicated not fully understood that has
[SPEAKER_15]: effects that are somewhat balancing to THC
so I know that there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: objective evidence I heard a talk
yesterday where people were talking about
[SPEAKER_15]: that that there's not a lot of objective
evidence for the entourage effect and
[SPEAKER_15]: that's true for a lot of the assertions
with the medical effects of cannabis but I
[SPEAKER_15]: will say there is plenty of anecdotal
evidence there's a lot of common sense
[SPEAKER_15]: involved and actually there is a report
that all of you should read from the
[SPEAKER_15]: National Academies of Science Engineering
and Medicine from January of this year
[SPEAKER_15]: that was a body that very critically
looked at this notion of of what cannabis
[SPEAKER_15]: can be used for what are the health
effects and they came to conclusions that
[SPEAKER_15]: any politician who would read it which is
probably none of them would have to come
[SPEAKER_15]: to the conclusion that there is indeed
medical use and the policy doesn't make
[SPEAKER_15]: sense and as you guys probably know
historically this conversation every time
[SPEAKER_15]: doctors have been asked to really
critically study this issue they've come
[SPEAKER_15]: to the same conclusion which is it really
shouldn't be against the law and it's with
[SPEAKER_15]: the doctors and the players that we have
been highly effective I know where I was
[SPEAKER_15]: going with that previous comment which is
that there is and I'll shut up after this
[SPEAKER_15]: that there is really a you know if there's
an ulterior motive for doctors for
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis regulation to be doing what we're
doing with the NFL because you know
[SPEAKER_15]: fifteen hundred sixteen hundred guys every
year are directly affected active players
[SPEAKER_15]: and all of the retired players who are
still dealing with the injuries that they
[SPEAKER_15]: suffered it's not just about them because
what they represent is a microcosm of
[SPEAKER_15]: society and what society has had to deal
with with rules that make no sense
[SPEAKER_15]: evidenced by the degree to which the
enforcement of this is so half-hearted
[SPEAKER_15]: that's why they're telling us when we're
going to get our drug test because they
[SPEAKER_15]: really don't want to ban us but they know
they have to continue with this and
[SPEAKER_08]: nobody's exactly sure why well I have some
ideas of why you know doing doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: these panels and hearing the discussion I
understand it's easy to look at the NFL
[SPEAKER_08]: and say the NFL needs to change the way it
looks at cannabis but the NFL is going to
[SPEAKER_08]: follow wherever the money is and wherever
the fans are saying and it's the same
[SPEAKER_08]: thing that's that's what our government
was built on and I know for me coming out
[SPEAKER_08]: and talking about my cannabis use even
though everyone knew it for a long time
[SPEAKER_08]: still still took me a while and it wasn't
till two years ago where I was finally
[SPEAKER_08]: like you know I can pretend that I don't
but everyone already knows that I do so
[SPEAKER_08]: fuck it and so and so I came and sat on a
panel and I was able to talk about it and
[SPEAKER_08]: I and I truly believe if all the the
closet cannabis consumers would just be
[SPEAKER_08]: honest things would change faster than
what any any of us can do even if everyone
[SPEAKER_08]: in the NFL wanted to do it it's really up
to it's up to the people and and so one of
[SPEAKER_08]: the reasons I'm here talking is maybe one
person in the crowd talk to someone else
[SPEAKER_08]: or talk to someone else and they finally
step out of the closet and are honest
[SPEAKER_08]: about about what cannabis has meant for
them and is done for them you know I've
[SPEAKER_08]: talked to a lot of people and I'm always
curious is like how did you start using
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis like how did it become something
that was appealing to you and across the
[SPEAKER_08]: board over 90% of the people said I was
hanging out with a friend and I had some
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of injury a knee injury ankle injury
a broken heart something going on in their
[SPEAKER_08]: lives and they noticed that when they used
when they used cannabis recreationally
[SPEAKER_08]: that whatever they were dealing with got
better and I think there's something about
[SPEAKER_08]: us inherently that when something works we
tend to go back to it you know on to
[SPEAKER_07]: compliment that Ricky I think like let's
go outside of cannabis like I've watched
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis acceptance happen and I'm I live
in San Francisco and and have watched you
[SPEAKER_07]: know through the AIDS movement and and the
gay rights and everything that's happened
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of in the epicenter of where I live
in acceptance no one should live in the
[SPEAKER_07]: closet for anything and it's liberating to
step out of the closet whatever you may be
[SPEAKER_08]: in the closet for step out man it feels
good it was funny so we had a we had a
[SPEAKER_08]: friend over at our house we had a friend
over our house and and we were we were
[SPEAKER_08]: consuming cannabis together and one of the
things he talked about was he's he's been
[SPEAKER_08]: smoking for over 20 years he'd been
married for I think 15 years and he's
[SPEAKER_08]: never consumed in front of his wife she's
not even against it the stigma runs deep
[SPEAKER_02]: the interesting thing that's that goes on
with football players is that we are
[SPEAKER_02]: always taught to shut up shut up and play
don't talk about your pain don't talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about how you feel and so in the realm of
cannabis in football you have like Ricky
[SPEAKER_02]: was saying a lot of guys in the closet who
use it and find benefits from it but don't
[SPEAKER_02]: feel comfortable talking because there's
this code of silence in the NFL and in
[SPEAKER_02]: football at all levels that tell you to
shut up and follow the plan and the plan
[SPEAKER_02]: is not for you to be an individual human
being talking about the fact that you are
[SPEAKER_02]: in pain but football players do feel the
pain and we have to manage it one way or
[SPEAKER_02]: the other and I always found that I healed
faster when I was consuming cannabis than
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was doing pills to heal you have to
feel you have to feel what's going on with
[SPEAKER_02]: your body pain serves a purpose and so for
guys who professional athletes who
[SPEAKER_02]: tinkered with every single kind of
medication to come to the conclusion the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis worked for them I think is
something something huge and guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out of the woodworks and I think
it's a an important conversation and Nate
[SPEAKER_15]: you you yeah and you're pointing you know
it's it's all retired players who are here
[SPEAKER_15]: it's very hard to find active players and
you guys can comment on this it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to because you'll get fired if you
don't do anything to draw attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself whether it's cannabis or politics
or anything they don't want you to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: human being and talk about your own ideas
so that's really hard when you retire
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what they call it from retiring
from football but when you go out into the
[SPEAKER_02]: real world we don't have the words we
don't know how to articulate our ideas and
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's like a five-year period from
when you're done playing to when you
[SPEAKER_02]: finally start to feel comfortable talking
about your own ideas and articulating
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself and so that's a big obstacle that
these guys face and it's only I mean also
[SPEAKER_00]: it hasn't been brought up that I think
needs to be addressed is opioids not only
[SPEAKER_00]: affect the players who are taking since
we're talking about the NFL it affects
[SPEAKER_00]: their families as well which is something
that wives and girlfriends know when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're taking the opioids how it affects
their attitudes how it affects their
[SPEAKER_00]: emotions and how it affects their
relationships is devastating to families
[SPEAKER_00]: in and of itself other than the pain
relief and the opioid addiction that these
[SPEAKER_07]: players are coming down with we have a
film that I might or might not show
[SPEAKER_07]: there's two there's two subjects I'm
interested in covering before we show that
[SPEAKER_07]: that I think are important so I'm actually
gonna ask for a show of hands because we
[SPEAKER_07]: don't we haven't got a lot of time left
I'm gonna try and fit both in but I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: interested to see we can talk about CTE
and concussion treatment and cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: relative to that or we can talk about
using it as focus as an athlete and maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: talk little is it a PED some people think
that some not and how maybe we use
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis when our training regiments who
here would rather hear about CTE and the
[SPEAKER_07]: focus hands all right all right CTE wins
today so this is an interesting one I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: actually I'm kind of glad we're going down
this road because there there's there's me
[SPEAKER_07]: and the players here and there's the
doctors and the doctors have to stick to
[SPEAKER_07]: data and empirical stuff and you know
we're guys that say we've lived this life
[SPEAKER_07]: we know this works and it can say it that
way they can't really say it the way we
[SPEAKER_00]: can say it so well maybe they can that's
yeah that's not always I thank you that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not always true I mean it depends on how
much you listen and how much you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: take with the players and other people who
are taking the opioids or cannabis how it
[SPEAKER_00]: really affects them in terms of you don't
have to be a rocket scientist to know hey
[SPEAKER_00]: I took this it didn't work now I take this
and it worked I mean yes it's not a study
[SPEAKER_00]: from across the street or from any
Stanford University but it's good enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to say yes let's try this let's
try something different no and I I'm not
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm I'm categorizing you like the players
you guys are are handcuffed by what the
[SPEAKER_07]: institution allows you to do it's kind of
what I'm trying to say so you do have to
[SPEAKER_07]: work within a box you can't step just like
the players if you step out of that box
[SPEAKER_07]: and start saying the wrong things you're
gone too you know and that's kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to purvey I don't know if
that's really true I mean being up and
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking like Dustin Sulak a lot of people
who came physicians who came here to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that I think I don't know if that's
really stepping out of the box it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledging one that there's a problem
and two that yes there could be a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: and we may have the solution to be able to
help that problem so I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: doctors are really trained that we have to
go with the evidence and it's got to be
[SPEAKER_15]: evidence-based and I see heads nodding
right now and I appreciate that and I grew
[SPEAKER_15]: up in the same era and I do feel that way
and when I hear about anecdotal evidence
[SPEAKER_15]: you know I hesitate just a bit because it
hasn't been established in the literature
[SPEAKER_15]: in the same way but I think that the
greatest argument for policy change is not
[SPEAKER_15]: nitpicking over the details of what
exactly cannabis can do and that book that
[SPEAKER_15]: came out earlier this year from the
National Academies really does lay out the
[SPEAKER_07]: case for that we only have a few minutes I
want to get into CTE so it's a
[SPEAKER_15]: non-negative argument that is actually the
best it doesn't hurt that bad and so why
[SPEAKER_07]: are we preventing people from using it
strong point and I agree with that but I
[SPEAKER_07]: we just don't have a lot of time and where
I'm going with this is because we're
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about CTE there's gonna be
different levels of commitment and and
[SPEAKER_07]: support for CBD and it's usage for CTE
because there's not empirical data behind
[SPEAKER_07]: it to the level we should have and I wish
we had time to show you the marijuana that
[SPEAKER_07]: the I think it's Mississippi and the only
marijuana these guys are allowed to
[SPEAKER_07]: research it's it's in California we call
it ditch weed or swag it's horrible and so
[SPEAKER_07]: they're they're handcuffed too I mean what
they have to research is awful we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about empirical data well here's a study
by Sue Sisley's do it looking at PTS
[SPEAKER_00]: trauma traumatic brain injury and from
University of Mississippi the only place
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're allowed to use the cannabis
for she's you know we've talked about what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is that they send her and it's
essentially seed stems and plant ground
[SPEAKER_00]: together in a little baggie that's fresh
frozen and shipped off to her with no
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledgement about what the
concentration of THC CBD any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes anything at all but what's in it
here's your cannabis here's what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to use so the study that she's
running if it comes out negative doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it's negative it just means the
product that was given to her was useless
[SPEAKER_00]: versus something that yes let's study
something so everyone's hamstrung in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of what it is to be able to do because
they don't want the results being shown
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah and as we go back to CTE this this
started everybody should watch a movie
[SPEAKER_07]: called concussion if they haven't seen it
with Will Smith it's an eye-opening
[SPEAKER_07]: tear-jerking movie and it tells you really
the way this all unfolded and and it was
[SPEAKER_07]: ugly and at this point there's you know it
was junior seo who really when he killed
[SPEAKER_07]: himself as a as a basically Hall of Famer
they couldn't they couldn't wipe it under
[SPEAKER_07]: you know scrape it under the rug and they
did that with hundreds other before
[SPEAKER_07]: hundreds of others before that Dave Mira
who's an ex BMX guy just killed himself
[SPEAKER_07]: because of concussions and concussions go
way outside of football to extreme sports
[SPEAKER_07]: surfing skateboarding everything soccer
even and so the CTE stuff's a big one and
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about how to use CBD as a
neuroprotectant is something I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: interested in and and that's kind of where
I was talking about the empirical data
[SPEAKER_07]: versus anecdotal evidence but I want to
have you guys talk about neuroprotectant
[SPEAKER_07]: and CBD together why don't I'd like to
have the player start on this one and kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of do any of you use CBD I know Evan you
have a CBD company and you know why don't
[SPEAKER_07]: you start in about your own personal usage
of CBD and relate it to neuroprotection if
[SPEAKER_07]: you do indeed if you did indeed you didn't
use it that way yeah well I think probably
[SPEAKER_14]: most of you guys have read the studies
done by dr. Mishulam and the profound
[SPEAKER_14]: effects of the cannabinoids and the brain
and how they act as a neuroprotectant and
[SPEAKER_14]: an antioxidant you know as a guy who
consumed cannabis throughout my NFL
[SPEAKER_14]: football career and a guy who suffered you
know handfuls of concussions having my
[SPEAKER_14]: bell rung I was lucky enough never to be
knocked unconscious some of these guys
[SPEAKER_14]: might be able to tell you a little bit
more about that but obviously concussions
[SPEAKER_14]: are an incredibly prevalent issue with
football it's something that happens every
[SPEAKER_14]: single play every single player is
smashing headfirst into another guy
[SPEAKER_14]: probably 60 70 times a game so this is
clearly something that we need to find a
[SPEAKER_14]: solution for I mean they've even done
studies that say 97% of the guys that
[SPEAKER_14]: played in the NFL are gonna come out on
some scale with CTE that's pretty scary
[SPEAKER_14]: being a guy who spent 15 years in the game
six years in the league I was a very
[SPEAKER_14]: violent player I don't think anybody gets
to that level unless you're incredibly
[SPEAKER_14]: physical and willing to put your body on
the line that being said you know the way
[SPEAKER_14]: that concussions are dealt with is guys
are basically sequestered you're you see
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm walking around the facility they'll
have sunglasses on they won't be allowed
[SPEAKER_14]: to go to meetings they're not allowed to
practice you're not really allowed to do
[SPEAKER_14]: much of anything you're kind of just stuck
in a dark hole somewhere in the training
[SPEAKER_14]: facility but that's being said like there
needs to be a solution and there is the
[SPEAKER_14]: data there is the research we've seen it
every guy up here I think is an example of
[SPEAKER_14]: the efficacy of cannabinoids on brain
trauma I know that I am very grateful for
[SPEAKER_14]: my cannabis use throughout my career
because really I came out of my career I
[SPEAKER_14]: was able to get rid of all the pills I got
off all the pills you know some guys are
[SPEAKER_14]: coming out of their career on anti-anxiety
meds and antidepressants and painkillers
[SPEAKER_14]: and all this other shit that is really
taxing and destroying their systems and
[SPEAKER_14]: their minds and their families you know
guys are leaving the house they can't get
[SPEAKER_14]: home because they can't remember how to
get back you know these are realities of
[SPEAKER_14]: the game and it's not just you know like
Jim said Junior Sayo I think really shined
[SPEAKER_14]: a light on the darkness that awaits
football players in their life after their
[SPEAKER_14]: careers if you're not taking care of
yourself if we're not starting to address
[SPEAKER_14]: these issues with cannabis because really
it's the only solution we're looking at
[SPEAKER_14]: and it needs to be changed we need to
start growing up and looking at real
[SPEAKER_14]: solutions to keeping these guys from
losing their minds and their lives
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in this realm cannabis and
football is so interesting to study in
[SPEAKER_02]: regards to brain injuries because on the
football field your most effective weapon
[SPEAKER_02]: is your head and the higher up you go the
more your coach to attack that other human
[SPEAKER_02]: and put him on his ass and the way you do
that is by hitting him with your face as
[SPEAKER_02]: hard as you can especially a guy who's
larger so you know you're going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: repetitive head trauma every day every
week so how do you treat that inevitable
[SPEAKER_02]: head trauma and half of the guys are
already using cannabis but they can't tell
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone about it the other half are not so
how do we study what's working for who in
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle of this repetitive head trauma
every day so these guys have to come out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the shadows to feel comfortable sharing
that data and that's the only way we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: learn anything about it I think and and
beyond that you're talking about neuro
[SPEAKER_00]: protection and CBD does the neuro
protection however the other thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately this the football players
are getting is torridol torridol is a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory platelet
inhibitor so these guys are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: platelet inhibitors getting hit in the
head causing concussions micro bleeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: the brain causing effects that yet they
don't even know what the result we know
[SPEAKER_00]: what the results are but everyone lines up
for the t-train yeah well let me tell you
[SPEAKER_08]: a story about this so so in 2003 I was
playing for the for the Dolphins and so
[SPEAKER_08]: 2002 and 2003 I led the NFL in touches and
if you ever seen me run I'm a very
[SPEAKER_08]: physical runner so I was I was yeah thank
you thank you so I remember sitting in a
[SPEAKER_08]: in the training room one day for practice
okay and watching guys come in one by one
[SPEAKER_08]: to get their torridol shot or to get their
pills and it occurred to me like wow we
[SPEAKER_08]: need this strong anti-inflammatory just to
practice on a daily basis and I just
[SPEAKER_08]: decided you know what I'm gonna see how
long I can go in the season without having
[SPEAKER_08]: to take these these pills and I was able
to make through the whole season again
[SPEAKER_08]: leading the NFL and in touches so what
what you're saying is so true and I and I
[SPEAKER_08]: think what what Evan touched on is taking
care of yourself and I think for me when I
[SPEAKER_08]: played and I would take torridol or I
would take Vicodin it was more to mask the
[SPEAKER_08]: pain because I was I was in a lot of pain
and when I use cannabis it was more to sit
[SPEAKER_08]: down on the ground and to think about my
day to do a little bit of stretching to to
[SPEAKER_08]: release the stress of the day to allow the
inflammation to dissipate and it was more
[SPEAKER_08]: holistic and inclusive for me and my whole
entire life and like Nate said earlier it
[SPEAKER_08]: made it easier to get back up the next day
and go at it again and I think football
[SPEAKER_08]: players are a great example of people
living extreme lives having to deal with a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of different stressors physically
mentally and emotionally but I think all
[SPEAKER_08]: of us in our lives are dealing with some
kind of stress and some kind of pain that
[SPEAKER_08]: inhibits our ability to recover and heal
and approach every day with with vigor and
[SPEAKER_08]: you guys know like the energy you have to
have and you have to bring on a daily
[SPEAKER_08]: basis in the NFL and for that reason I
think we're prime examples of people who
[SPEAKER_08]: who have through our own experiences have
learned to to use cannabis in a more
[SPEAKER_08]: conscious way and I think that has a lot
to do with education and people telling
[SPEAKER_08]: their stories
[SPEAKER_11]: given that we've got these wonderful
football players here and we have their
[SPEAKER_11]: attention we thought we would spend we'll
give you another up till three o'clock to
[SPEAKER_11]: do a Q&A with the football players if
you'd like to we do have the break going
[SPEAKER_11]: on in in sort of the lobby so if you do
want to take a break please feel free to
[SPEAKER_11]: we're gonna have the Q&A if you do take a
break please be cognizant we've got the
[SPEAKER_11]: camera running down the middle aisle here
and over the center but we figured that
[SPEAKER_11]: we've got their attention so if we've got
questions we can fire away we do have some
[SPEAKER_11]: mics in the audience and we can roll the
roll the mics around to everybody who has
[SPEAKER_07]: questions awesome there we go as we in
this I want to there's a friend of mine
[SPEAKER_07]: named Steve D'Angelo who's been a big
figure and almost a mentor to me in this
[SPEAKER_07]: space I know Ricky's friends with Steve
also and what Steve taught me and I want
[SPEAKER_07]: just have this be the parting words
because again it transcends from the pros
[SPEAKER_07]: to average Joes and every one of us in
this room you know I thought I was a
[SPEAKER_07]: stoner for a long time and I realized I
used cannabis to make my mind right and it
[SPEAKER_07]: helped me study through college it helped
me be a better person it helped me be a
[SPEAKER_07]: better husband I don't go drink alcohol I
go take a little cannabis and I'm a more
[SPEAKER_07]: engaged dad so when you look at your
cannabis use if you think you're a stoner
[SPEAKER_07]: take another look at it and look like
there's a reason you use it you come home
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe you have anxiety or tired your back
hurts most people that use cannabis are
[SPEAKER_07]: not stoners there's a root cause that they
use it and it's because it's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_07]: plant so I want to impart you on that and
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah let's go to questions for these guys
and what advice would you give to peewee
[SPEAKER_04]: footballers you know they're out there
they're out there doing what you guys do
[SPEAKER_04]: they're imitators and they're butting
their heads and my one of my grandsons has
[SPEAKER_04]: already been hospitalized so what advice
do you give to them and how do we approach
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis as a neuroprotective that's
definitely one of my concerns as well is
[SPEAKER_06]: you know that the little guys but it's
kind of in the same boat as you know some
[SPEAKER_06]: kids that suffer from seizures from
epilepsy and so forth and really should
[SPEAKER_06]: look at more to the CBD it's more of the
you know non psychoactive part of the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant that would be in my opinion more
suitable for you know the younger audience
[SPEAKER_06]: and using it and it's also been you know
shown to have those neuroprotective agents
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as that you know antioxidants so
that's part of you know why you know I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: real passionate about using this platform
to cause awareness and education because
[SPEAKER_06]: it is you know I don't expect no one to
really feel sorry for me for what I went
[SPEAKER_06]: through you know I we made this choice my
biggest issue is you know going back to
[SPEAKER_06]: the education and I really think the NFL
is missing the opportunity to be a leader
[SPEAKER_06]: because they have I think one of the you
know best situations to prove out some of
[SPEAKER_06]: this data for you know the game for
themselves but as well as you know the
[SPEAKER_06]: general public so again a CBT or the
cannabidiol you heard people speak of I
[SPEAKER_02]: will look into that more the hard part
about youth sports is you are you are
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving it up to the coach and and there
are a lot of different coaches that coach
[SPEAKER_02]: youth football some of them are cognizant
of head injuries and want to see their
[SPEAKER_02]: players healthy some of them want their
kids to knock each other out every day and
[SPEAKER_02]: you go and watch these practices and these
men whose football careers didn't work out
[SPEAKER_02]: for them are living through these kids
they're playing through these kids and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's when it becomes dangerous some of
the drills they'll do at practice have a
[SPEAKER_02]: kid running from there and a kid running
from there and meet in the middle full
[SPEAKER_02]: speed head first that can't be good for a
seven-year-old brain and so paying
[SPEAKER_02]: attention to the coaches paying attention
to the medical services that they provide
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever hospitals or doctors they're
working with and if you and if your
[SPEAKER_02]: grandson has gone to the hospital for a
head injury consult that doctor and ask if
[SPEAKER_02]: if he should be keep doing this
considering the way he responds to hitting
[SPEAKER_02]: some guys are more susceptible to brain
injuries than others I found that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: one guy will get hit and pop right back up
another guy gets the same hit and he's
[SPEAKER_02]: woozy and he gets a concussion so some
kids are not suited for it and we make the
[SPEAKER_02]: mistake of trying to funnel all of our
boys onto the football field because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: so popular because it's so lucrative but
not all boys are meant for it so my
[SPEAKER_02]: personally personal belief is
eight-year-old shouldn't be smashing heads
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of people love it it's not a
guarantee you're gonna have a brain injury
[SPEAKER_02]: but you just have to be diligent and pay
attention to your child that's it just one
[SPEAKER_14]: more note on that I don't think kids
should play football until they're at
[SPEAKER_14]: least in high school thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys for being here my question is do
you ever see a role of cannabis being a
[SPEAKER_01]: prevention fork so as a pretreatment
before playing because we do know of an
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid deficiency is there a way
that we can treat football players before
[SPEAKER_00]: they go on the field there are there is
research being done of pure CBD to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to be taken prophylactically hopefully
those studies will come out so the yes
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be like a pill you take a
capsule of CBD and you take it an hour
[SPEAKER_00]: before they would have sports and
hopefully that would prevent all the neuro
[SPEAKER_00]: degeneration that we saw I think was
yesterday and yeah hopefully that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to absolutely happen with pure CBD with no
THC activity whatsoever hopefully I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got to get federally rescheduled or
descheduled before the before the NFL is
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna really jump on it you know there are
22 teams in the NFL in which they play in
[SPEAKER_02]: states where it is medically legal but for
those other 10 the NFL is gonna consider
[SPEAKER_02]: that a lopsided product and it creates an
unfair advantage for one team and so I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't believe the NFL is gonna jump all
over that argument I think they're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna wait and see they're not gonna lead
the charge on a social issue the NFL just
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't do that they lag behind and then
react I think it's what's important is to
[SPEAKER_02]: arm the union with all of this knowledge
to let them come to the negotiating table
[SPEAKER_02]: and make their case strongly as of yet
they haven't been able to do that Ricky
[SPEAKER_02]: was touching on it they're starting to
come around to it but if they realized how
[SPEAKER_02]: important this plant is for their league
and how much better it is for you than
[SPEAKER_02]: what these players are being injected with
on company grounds then they'll start to
[SPEAKER_08]: come around I will say Nate when I talked
I talked to Dee last week on this issue
[SPEAKER_08]: and one of the things he said is the way
that the Players Association is
[SPEAKER_08]: approaching it it's not a drug issue it's
a health issue and so they're putting it
[SPEAKER_08]: on this on par with the concussion issue
and they're saying it's not negotiable you
[SPEAKER_08]: know like we shouldn't have to negotiate
to have concussion specialists on the
[SPEAKER_08]: sideline we shouldn't have to negotiate to
allow our players to not be punished for
[SPEAKER_07]: using cannabis Jerry Jones just stepped
out in favor or said he thinks I think
[SPEAKER_07]: basically it should be legalized or
authorized in the NFL so it's changed
[SPEAKER_07]: happen slowly but having Jerry step out as
one person so hopefully the rest will
[SPEAKER_03]: follow soon I'd like to ask a question if
I could I'm Martin Lee the director of
[SPEAKER_03]: project CBD and you know the study you're
referring to about CBD being
[SPEAKER_03]: neuroprotective there's also study about
THC being neuroprotective and antioxidant
[SPEAKER_03]: are you emphasizing CBD so much because of
the possible legal opportunities there
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it still is federally illegal
it makes it easier for sure well possibly
[SPEAKER_03]: is it better I'm concerned that is it
better for people and people's brains in
[SPEAKER_08]: terms of what cushions well I think right
now what I've noticed least is there seems
[SPEAKER_08]: to be some kind of taboo against all three
states of consciousness and it's people
[SPEAKER_08]: aren't willing to look at it or talk about
it and so we just say CBD but you know we
[SPEAKER_07]: got a lot of work to do medicine is very
important and it's more of an Eastern
[SPEAKER_07]: philosophy instead of isolating compounds
from things in nature let's look at nature
[SPEAKER_07]: and use nature and and really that is
coming from a totally different
[SPEAKER_07]: perspective of take this pill to fix you
and I think that's a good question because
[SPEAKER_07]: I I believe for myself I use THC all the
time every day with CBD as well and it
[SPEAKER_07]: affects for me it helps me a lot more when
there's THC included so I think whole
[SPEAKER_07]: plant medicine is a really important thing
to think about I think I think you'll find
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the case with most football players
who use it I don't think they isolate with
[SPEAKER_16]: a CBD I think they are believers in the
whole plan hi I have a question just out
[SPEAKER_16]: of curiosity while you were playing how
were you able to get guidance as to how to
[SPEAKER_16]: use the cannabis were you using just
recreational versus medicinal grade and
[SPEAKER_02]: could you talk about the difference no
guidance you're on your own but for
[SPEAKER_02]: professional athletes who have been
tinkering with medication in their bodies
[SPEAKER_02]: and optimal performance their entire lives
by the time you get to the NFL you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good idea of what works for your
body and what doesn't at least if you are
[SPEAKER_02]: medicating with cannabis so I did it on my
own I did it at home I don't know how
[SPEAKER_02]: these guys did it but yeah it was it was
in the shadows that we did not talk about
[SPEAKER_17]: it at work my name is Janice Knox and I am
one of the kind of MDs and also represent
[SPEAKER_17]: the AC clinics which stand for American
Cannabinoid Clinics and I have two points
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to make and one is that athletes
are incredible role models so you guys are
[SPEAKER_17]: incredible role models for all those young
boys who are playing football so my
[SPEAKER_17]: question is here what are you doing to get
the current players to come out of the
[SPEAKER_17]: closet because they are role models and
even if you can't because you're not
[SPEAKER_17]: clinicians advise people to take CBD or
THC or any of that looking at the current
[SPEAKER_17]: football players playing and role models
admitting that they use this for their
[SPEAKER_17]: health reasons can you imagine what that
would mean to parents to coaches to two
[SPEAKER_17]: young kids playing so my question is what
are you doing to encourage the current
[SPEAKER_17]: players who may be using cannabis to step
out of that closet I think just continuing
[SPEAKER_14]: to do stuff like this continuing to get
our voices out there continuing to show
[SPEAKER_14]: guys that it's safe to share your stories
and it's safe to talk about obviously the
[SPEAKER_14]: current players have a number of hurdles
obviously one losing your jobs and then
[SPEAKER_14]: two endorsements and all the companies
that sponsor these athletes you know
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a lot of risk of having those
things pulled but I think you know this
[SPEAKER_14]: this panel this this advocacy that we've
been doing it's grown probably over the
[SPEAKER_14]: last two years since the first time I
stepped foot in a cannabis conference
[SPEAKER_14]: talking about my experience and we're just
I think we're going to continue to do that
[SPEAKER_14]: we're pretty passionate dedicated guys too
we want you know our brothers in the
[SPEAKER_14]: league to understand what this is all
about and change the stigma of what this
[SPEAKER_14]: plant can be
[SPEAKER_13]: thank you oh hello yes thank you Bobby
West I have a question for you with all
[SPEAKER_13]: the opiates and painkillers that they're
giving you guys in the NFL when do they
[SPEAKER_13]: determine that you actually have a drug
problem because they feed you all these
[SPEAKER_13]: opiates and stuff I mean and it carries on
how does it not until you retire because
[SPEAKER_08]: the drug problem while you're playing is a
good thing it means you're on the field so
[SPEAKER_13]: they have basically they look at it where
hey long as you can play it's not as you
[SPEAKER_08]: can play and you stay out of trouble that
that's the NFL's main thing be on the
[SPEAKER_08]: field stay out of trouble so you can stay
on the field thank you I mean it's a
[SPEAKER_15]: political issue and I think that well you
guys may know that there was a Harvard
[SPEAKER_15]: report last year about NFL and and pain
control and there were two main
[SPEAKER_15]: conclusions one that pain and and medical
treatment and the use of opioids versus
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis should not be something that's in
the collective bargaining agreement it
[SPEAKER_15]: shouldn't be something that's negotiated
because it's about health it's not about
[SPEAKER_15]: you know benefits some sort of selfish
motives on the parts of the players that
[SPEAKER_15]: was one conclusion the other is that the
physicians who are examining the patients
[SPEAKER_15]: and the physicians who are setting the
policy should not be beholden to the NFL
[SPEAKER_18]: you actually may have just answered my
question but um I was I was going to ask
[SPEAKER_18]: how strongly is the opiate usage
encouraged by management staff and if
[SPEAKER_18]: there were any ramifications for not
taking part in it well it's it's changed I
[SPEAKER_08]: mean there's ramifications as far as
you'll be in pain unless you can find an
[SPEAKER_08]: alternative but the the rules have changed
in the NFL there's they've gotten so much
[SPEAKER_08]: slack that they've really tightened up I
mean there's a report out a couple of
[SPEAKER_08]: weeks ago that they were you know when you
when you give out a controlled substance
[SPEAKER_08]: you're supposed to take notes about how
much you gave so that you can track how
[SPEAKER_08]: much someone is taking some teams trainers
did it some teams didn't but you know
[SPEAKER_08]: there was no oversight I know when I
played and I've been retired for five
[SPEAKER_08]: years but like I said I carried the ball
so much when we got on the plane on the
[SPEAKER_08]: ride home trainer would just come up and
give me a little bag with three Vicodin so
[SPEAKER_08]: it just depends on on the team but the
history is that they've people when
[SPEAKER_08]: players are hurting and they come and ask
for it then they're they're giving it and
[SPEAKER_08]: for me I didn't have that much experience
with with opioids just a little Vicodin
[SPEAKER_08]: after the game but for me what concerned
me was that the tort on the industry and
[SPEAKER_08]: the strong anti-inflammatories that you
pretty much have to take almost every day
[SPEAKER_12]: to feel to feel like you can go out and
practice I just had two basic question so
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had two severe head injuries both are
definitely severe concussions one both of
[SPEAKER_12]: them have taken care of like some of my
long-term memory and so forth and I've
[SPEAKER_12]: consumed cannabis ever since I was a child
my mother used to use it for me when I was
[SPEAKER_12]: in her womb when I had colic and when I
was born it's been in my life ever since
[SPEAKER_12]: I've you know my whole life after my
concussions every time I consume anything
[SPEAKER_12]: with THC in it I get unbelievably wretched
headaches and there's this aftermath of
[SPEAKER_12]: shakes and chills and blurred vision and
light stigmatism but I take a hundred and
[SPEAKER_12]: twenty milligrams of CBD every day with
less than a percent THC and it you know it
[SPEAKER_12]: doesn't affect but have you guys ever
noticed any effects with concussions where
[SPEAKER_12]: THC because of the increased blood
vascularity or whatever it may be that's
[SPEAKER_12]: actually increasing the pressures causing
that type of an effect I've never
[SPEAKER_15]: experienced that myself but the important
point of that is that the individual
[SPEAKER_15]: response to THC CBD the plan as a whole is
going to be very particular to an
[SPEAKER_15]: individual and so I have no doubt that
you're telling the truth and that it's
[SPEAKER_15]: happening exactly as you say but that's
the effect on you it could be completely
[SPEAKER_15]: different for somebody else with another
kind of head injury yes good afternoon so
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering have you begun a
conversation with athletic directors at
[SPEAKER_05]: high schools or universities and if you
have not how would you encourage us to go
[SPEAKER_05]: back to our local communities to share as
parents and participants in the community
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis activists what is safe healing
practices with cannabis because as Ricky
[SPEAKER_05]: stated the zero tolerance it ends your
career it happened to me I got kicked out
[SPEAKER_05]: of some team and it jeopardizes your
collegiate opportunities and I think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: so important that a conversation begins at
that level and if you haven't started
[SPEAKER_05]: would you be willing to add even language
to your website so that each of us can go
[SPEAKER_05]: back to our hometowns and say oh please
look at this yeah the amateur the amateur
[SPEAKER_02]: issue is really hard to deal with with
cannabis because you got to be 21 years
[SPEAKER_05]: old to purchase it not in Washington State
18 but just advocating it in schools is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to run up against a lot of
opposition I believe so but I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: should be a parent issue with if you
believe in this product and your kid is
[SPEAKER_02]: suffering from things that he could
benefit he or she could benefit from the
[SPEAKER_02]: use of CBD then go ahead and reach out to
a doctor who can help you with that but
[SPEAKER_02]: the amateur stuff is hard when it comes to
it because I actually started using it
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was 14 years old I used it for the
first time about a month before I had my
[SPEAKER_02]: first concussion on the football field so
my first football injury was a concussion
[SPEAKER_02]: and I started using cannabis a month
before and my brain feels pretty good
[SPEAKER_02]: right now and it's felt good all along and
I've never gotten involved with the pills
[SPEAKER_02]: they never sunk in with me I never had
developed a taste for it I believe it's
[SPEAKER_02]: because I was familiar with the other side
of the fence with cannabis the whole time
[SPEAKER_02]: and I knew it worked for my body now
that's not something that people are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be open-minded to a lot of people in
high schools that is actually probably
[SPEAKER_02]: helping some high school kids out there
but I think that's down the road I think
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to work on changing the scheduling
of it descheduling rescheduling it before
[SPEAKER_02]: we can start at the NFL and then it'll
trickle down we also need to establish the
[SPEAKER_15]: difference between underage use when it's
for medicinal versus personal use so we
[SPEAKER_15]: know that underage use recreationally of
cannabis can be deleterious to development
[SPEAKER_15]: and I know not everybody agrees with that
but that's my reading of the data is that
[SPEAKER_15]: the younger you are and the more you do it
at a very young age the greater the chance
[SPEAKER_15]: there's going to be an issue and you know
with what Nate's saying I mean I keep
[SPEAKER_15]: starting at 14 I know somebody who started
at 12 or 13 and he just got his PhD at
[SPEAKER_15]: Princeton and he's a brilliant guy so it's
highly variable what we don't know is what
[SPEAKER_15]: the effect of medical cannabis is in
underage use and I know Stacey Gruber
[SPEAKER_15]: she's out there somewhere they're doing
research right now at McLean Hospital on
[SPEAKER_15]: this issue trying to figure out is it
different for underage users when they're
[SPEAKER_15]: getting it for a specific medical reason
and there's some actually there's some
[SPEAKER_15]: evidence that it may not but we need more
research before you make a conclusion like
[SPEAKER_10]: that and certainly on that note Stacey's
actually our next speaker I'd love to keep
[SPEAKER_10]: this panel going because it's been a
wonderful discussion I would like to thank
[SPEAKER_10]: everyone particularly for coming out of
the closet and helping us move the
[SPEAKER_10]: industry forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: you you
