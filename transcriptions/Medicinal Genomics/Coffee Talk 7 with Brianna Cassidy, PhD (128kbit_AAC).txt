[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing, who will be part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the CanMed 2020 conference in Pasadena,
California, this September 20th through
[SPEAKER_01]: 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager of Medicinal
Genomics and a proud member of the CanMed
[SPEAKER_01]: 2020 team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Head over to canmedevents.com to check out
our Phase 1 schedule, which includes
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation topics from 20 of our invited
speakers and abstract presenters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will continue to add to this lineup
throughout the summer, so be sure to sign
[SPEAKER_01]: up for email alerts so you don't miss any
announcements.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you sign up on our podcast page,
canmedevents.com slash coffee talk,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will also be entered into a drawing to
win two tickets to our CanMed 2020 VIP
[SPEAKER_01]: dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this episode, we talk with Brianna
Cassidy, who is the chief scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: officer at CDX Analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brianna and the team at CDX perform safety
testing on all types of cannabis samples,
[SPEAKER_01]: including potency, pesticides,
heavy metals, residual solvents,
[SPEAKER_01]: and microbial contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you will hear from our conversation,
Brianna takes a creative and analytical
[SPEAKER_01]: approach to solving problems that come
with testing cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: At CanMed 2020, Brianna will share her
process for evaluating new analytical
[SPEAKER_01]: methods and technologies for her lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can imagine, there are a number of
vendors looking to install their systems
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis testing labs, so it helps to
have a thorough and objective process to
[SPEAKER_01]: choose the best option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our team knows firsthand that Brianna is
thorough when evaluating new technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: She and the team at CDX provided data that
was a major part of the Medicinal Genomics
[SPEAKER_01]: Manufacturer Validation document.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brianna and I also discussed the issue of
consistency when it comes to potency
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised to learn that cannabis
flowers from the same batch are often 50%
[SPEAKER_01]: more or less potent than what's reported
on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: She also explained how water content can
make a big difference in potency results.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are excited to have Brianna as part of
CanMed 2020, and we are excited to see you
[SPEAKER_01]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to CanMedEvents.com now to see our
ticket pricing options and get your ticket
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are currently offering early bird
pricing through August 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are also offering a 100% refund to
ticket holders should CanMed 2020 need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be postponed due to COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest assured that we are working closely
with the Pasadena Convention Center to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that we can provide a safe
environment for our staff and attendees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as of this recording, the event is

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Brianna
[SPEAKER_01]: Cassidy of CDX Analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Brianna, how are we doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty well, Ben, yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well, doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I always like to say, when I talk
to people from the lab testing profession,
[SPEAKER_01]: I love getting a chance to talk to you
because we at Medicinal Genomics,
[SPEAKER_01]: we work with you guys very closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know what you do on the microbial
side, obviously, because of what we do at
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really like to talk to you about all
the other things that you test for at the
[SPEAKER_01]: testing lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me a little bit about CDX,
your position there, and what a typical
[SPEAKER_01]: day is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, I'd like to say I'm
honored to be a part of the CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited to be presenting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my title is Chief Science Officer at
CDX Analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we test for a myriad of different
things in cannabis and cannabis-infused
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the cannabinoids, the active
ingredients, terpenes, also possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: active ingredients, and then some
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at heavy metals,
pesticides, microbials, mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have some disruptive
technology in the lab, too, in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: our dry weight measurement and accounting
for water content in samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, tell me a bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a feeling you might ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have good instincts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to talk about water content
because the reported concentrations are
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be indicative of how much what
it is we're seeing is in the dry weight of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sample being tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis can be around 80% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't accurately account for
that 80% and subtract it out, the result
[SPEAKER_00]: from your very precise analytical
instrumentation could be completely moot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suggested way to do this by the
American Herbal Pharmacopeia is by loss on
[SPEAKER_00]: drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's essentially taking the sample
and putting it in an oven for a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has some implications,
that loss on drying method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, water desorption is a very
slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you reach completion, it becomes
slower and slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're to put a really wet sample in
alongside a very dry sample after the same
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure to temperature and time,
those two samples will still have
[SPEAKER_00]: different water contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more wet sample will still be wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't account for all the water
in a sample, you are going to artificially
[SPEAKER_00]: deflate all of your analytical results.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over account for water content by
possibly, let's say, baking off terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and other volatile parts of your sample,
assuming they're water, but they're not,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can artificially inflate your
analytical results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done is we've incorporated a
technique other than loss on drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using gas phase Karl Fischer
titration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this does is using a subsample of
what we're testing, we can figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: much reaction we get with the water
content in that sample using a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And simply subtract the water content out
using the molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this allows for an extremely precise
and accurate result for all of our testing
[SPEAKER_00]: that we do on flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so if I followed that, if I followed
that and I'm not sure that I did,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're doing is actually just
measuring the water content and then kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of subtracting that out or applying some
kind of algorithm to separate that out
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than trying to bake it to be 80% or
whatever percent is the recommended dry
[SPEAKER_01]: weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, do I have it right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of baking out the water
content, we test for it chemically and
[SPEAKER_00]: then subtract it from the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you get so a consumer going into
dispensary and buying some flour,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is sort of the average water content
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it vary between the different buds or
the different strains or is it sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively consistent?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see cured bud coming in at around four
to 10% water content by weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a, that's a decent range.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when you're talking about
the testing limits in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're quantifying down to parts per
billion levels, that range has a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on the final result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now is that specifically for potency
or can that apply to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals and other contaminants as
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single result that is reported for a
flour or plant based sample is impacted by
[SPEAKER_00]: water content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this all really seems to jive with the
article that I was reading that you and
[SPEAKER_01]: Cindy Orser had authored that was all
about cannabis uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and how, you know, if you're
taking a big batch of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting different subsamples of that to
do your testing, the difference in those
[SPEAKER_01]: different subsamples can be pretty vast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I imagine that this water content is
just another variable that goes into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that article was a blast to write with
Cindy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, you know, medicinal genomics
is great about this too, is the
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration to talk about these
variables like, you know, measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: uncertainty, water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why is it that people are
getting different results for what they
[SPEAKER_00]: think is the same batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those discussions are really important
to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That article does encompass a lot of
different discussions on what can impact
[SPEAKER_00]: your test results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in addition to water content,
what are some of the other things that can
[SPEAKER_01]: be leading to this uncertainty problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that's just sort of a
necessary evil of testing something like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like cannabis flour, or is it something
that there's not enough standards between
[SPEAKER_01]: the labs combination of the two or more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you covered a good bit of them,
but it is true to say that any measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: that is taken, whether you're measuring a
string with a ruler or you're measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: the nanograms of pesticide and one gram of
flour, both of those situations are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a plus or minus around the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the article that Cindy and I wrote goes
into some other variables that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: adding to this plus or minus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already talked about water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you briefly brought up testing
different buds from the same plant and how
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant itself being inconsistent
throughout in terms of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration and possibly contaminants
does contribute to the plus or minus of
[SPEAKER_00]: your result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most efficient way to mitigate
that is to have homogeneous batches of
[SPEAKER_00]: product, meaning that they're well mixed
and that they are the same throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when a sample, a subsample of that
batch is taken to a laboratory,
[SPEAKER_00]: the results for that subsample actually
represent the batch itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's going to be pretty hard to do
with cannabis flour though, because you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to take a huge batch and grind
it all up because then you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: lose your bag appeal, lose those nice
beautiful buds that people are so
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you, how do you overcome that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, instead of overcoming it in
an industry where that isn't something
[SPEAKER_00]: that is altogether possible, you instead
have to accurately account for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is, you know,
if one bud has a different result than
[SPEAKER_00]: another bud, then understanding that when
you look at the label of your product,
[SPEAKER_00]: of your cannabis buds, when you pull a bud
from that container to consume that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that bud could be plus or minus 50% or
more of what is on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, that can be alarming,
but at the same time, knowing that and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding it is, is just as important
as solving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to cut you off, but there is
a peer reviewed publication in Forensic
[SPEAKER_00]: Science International where they show the
test results of different plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: within the same clone and how much the
cannabinoid results vary from bud to bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's an interesting one to
look at, interesting one to look at if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, if you want to get into it even
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm just thinking with,
with CanMed being so focused on using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as a medicine, that's got to be
something that if you are using flour to
[SPEAKER_01]: treat your condition, that's something you
really need to take, take seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, what are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know you're not a physician and
you're not going to be giving out any
[SPEAKER_01]: medical advice, but in terms of patients
who are treating with cannabis flour,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are sort of some things that they
need to keep in mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, first of all, I appreciate
you recognizing that I'm not a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your philosophy is a completely different
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I would look more towards the products
that are available that are a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more homogeneous, meaning, you know,
liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, they all have their
own inhomogeneity variables related to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until someone does a test comparing
the homogeneity of cannabis infused
[SPEAKER_00]: products to concentrates or extracts to
flours, it's, it's kind of hard to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to navigate that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But theoretically, I would assume that
liquid or cannabis infused products based
[SPEAKER_00]: options are more homogeneous than buds
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, then comes the whole problem of,
you know, consistency from batch to batch
[SPEAKER_01]: or lot to lot, which I can imagine can
vary as well just because of whether it be
[SPEAKER_01]: sourcing the material or changing in
production or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in, with, with
pharmaceuticals, that's, that's where I
[SPEAKER_00]: come from, is the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USP has very strict testing
requirements that have to be met in order
[SPEAKER_00]: for a sample to be even considered
representative of the batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those tests ensue taking, you know,
30 plus units and testing them
[SPEAKER_00]: individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to be within the same result
in order to actually move forward with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with that batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do see the cannabis industry
eventually getting to the point where they
[SPEAKER_00]: require homogeneity testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen clients that are starting to
undertake homogeneity testing as just a
[SPEAKER_00]: precaution for their business,
because what that does is it gives them a
[SPEAKER_00]: snapshot of how consistent their product
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ensures their clients, the
consumers of this product, that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: expect that the label represents what they
are consuming and that it's consistent as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually a big advantage to the
marketing of a product to go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: undertake this homogeneity testing and to
shoot to create a more consistent product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I imagine that's where we hope this is
all going, is that the, the companies and
[SPEAKER_01]: the manufacturers will do all this
testing, not because they have to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because they want to, or because the
customer demands it or expects it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to see that at least some are
already taking that step and eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone will get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned you came from
pharmaceutical testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious when you say that,
you know, in the cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the difference in concentrations can
be up to 50%, where is it that the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals, what percentage or what
difference are they really aiming for in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of consistency?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with, with cannabis, I think the 50% is
going to be a relatively normal happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the concentration can be a
plus or minus.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 50% just to clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: In pharmaceuticals, they're looking for,
they measure consistency by a metric
[SPEAKER_00]: called relative standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are USP guidelines on,
it's called content uniformity is the
[SPEAKER_00]: title of the document where they give
different, different relative percentages
[SPEAKER_00]: and differences based on the product type
and how potent it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to go back to you mentioned
when we were kind of talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: alternatives to using maybe cannabis
flower for, for treating a condition that
[SPEAKER_01]: there are different cannabis infused
products out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious because you see all
different types of cannabis infused
[SPEAKER_01]: products out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering what are the sort of the
normal ones that come through your lab or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some of the not so normal ones that
may have come through your lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a myriad of different matrices and
we're not generally surprised anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen anything from infused drinks
that market is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a lot of infused chocolate
products, a lot of infused gummy products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently, vaginal and anal
suppositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the list of products that we see
in the lab just is unending.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it seems like, it seems like every
week, every month, they're coming up with
[SPEAKER_01]: a new, a new thing to infuse cannabis
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the most challenging of the
matrices that you've had to deal with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the infused drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infused products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, infused products in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: require more astute testing because they
include ingredients that could possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: interfere with the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could interfere with the test by
covering up the signal of the analyte that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking for, where we can't see the
cannabinoid or we can't see the metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could infuse, they could interfere
with the test in a way that those
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients hold on to the constituent
that we're looking for and keep it from
[SPEAKER_00]: being in the solution that we're looking
to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to mitigate that, CDX has launched a
formulation test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is, is we actually go in and
we work through the sample in several
[SPEAKER_00]: different methods to ensure that those
things, that those possibilities are
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, cannabis infused products in
general, where we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: literally an infinite list of possible
interferences, have to be taken seriously
[SPEAKER_00]: in testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in any instance where
anybody says that they have a one method
[SPEAKER_00]: solves all process, they just simply
haven't looked into it in depth enough to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to find that there are variables in these
different cannabis infused products that
[SPEAKER_00]: do impact their tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you basically put any new cannabis type
product through sort of a battery of tests
[SPEAKER_01]: to sort of really break down what's in
there and what could potentially be
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing off your results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is something that we have
been working with a few of our clients in
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually part of what I plan
on presenting at cannabis med.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's going to be a demonstration
of how, you know, different methods can
[SPEAKER_00]: give different results on the same exact
products and understanding how to take
[SPEAKER_00]: that knowledge and mitigate in order to
report an accurate and precise result.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an excellent segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, yeah, the title of your talk here
is navigating cannabis method options
[SPEAKER_01]: through implementation of novel validation
design and statistical comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you did just give a little bit of a
preview with about what that talk is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be about, but I was wondering if you'd
give us a little bit more.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we have a lot of different testing
options as a, as third party testers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of instrument vendors have
prepackaged methods and instrumentation
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be used to measure the
cannabinoid concentration or the heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metal concentration, or as you very well
know, the microbial concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the talk is going to be about how to
choose the method that is most appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: for what it is that you're doing in a
quantitative and statistical way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, accurate science is all
about absolving subjectivity as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at the data and the relative
standard deviations and the robustness,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what's going to give you the answer
to which platform you should choose to do
[SPEAKER_00]: your testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the different methods
or I shouldn't say methods, but what are
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the different types of testing
that you are going to be sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: highlighting in your talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it more on the, the potency side,
heavy metals, microbials, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: We find different avenues every day that
we're in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I plan on doing is choosing the
ones that best illustrate the need for
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative decision-making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now it's looking like that
discussion will be based on microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little bit of a preview to
this given by Yvonne.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's already presented this last fall
with the Grim Reaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I might build on that a
little bit with the in-lab testing we did
[SPEAKER_00]: at CDX and the validation that we have for
inter-laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have a lot of different options in
terms of what other test methods I
[SPEAKER_00]: include.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be a little bit on the water content
quantification we talked about earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing that to the loss on drying
method in terms of precision and accuracy
[SPEAKER_00]: and robustness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk about cannabis infused
products and different extraction methods
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabinoid testing and how those
impact the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such an exciting new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, scientists have only had,
you know, 20, 25 years to work with this
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really fun to be a part of,
you know, battening down the hatches and
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up with methods that consistently
trump what was currently in use days,
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, months, or years before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to block off a whole
afternoon for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to talk to AJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I'm glad that you brought up Grim
Reaper and the talk that Yvonne had given
[SPEAKER_01]: at CanMed 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you did contribute a lot of great
data that was used in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if folks are interested, they can
check out that talk and all the CanMed
[SPEAKER_01]: 2019 talks at canmedevents.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice little plug in there for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned what you did before you
got into the cannabis space a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: briefly, but I was wondering a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you do before you got into
cannabis and why did you decide to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the switch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long journey, but just very
quickly, you know, I have a chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: bachelor's with two art minors,
art history and studio art.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I got my PhD in analytical
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that time, I worked on a lot of
forensic applications, blood detection,
[SPEAKER_00]: blood stain age development, using
different light-based techniques combined
[SPEAKER_00]: with statistical data analysis to
correctly classify unknowns, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: really fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did environmental sampling and
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I moved on to the
pharmaceutical industry, where I worked to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the impacts different
formulations have on active cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did that through pharmaceutical
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what I did was keep track
of what fillers in drugs do to the drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and how they impact the
expiration date of the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that work, it turned out to be
incredibly relevant, especially to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis infused products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited to apply that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in getting into the cannabis industry,
it was something, you know, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so new.
[SPEAKER_00]: People really haven't had time to nail
down the testing methods and there weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: that many peer reviewed publications and
still aren't on cannabis testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very lucrative to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be neat to be a part of
something where creativity paired with
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical knowledge could be used to really
give back and have a high impact to
[SPEAKER_00]: society.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at CDX Analytics for nearly a
year with state of the art brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumentation, designing methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very grateful that the president
and CEO of CDX has a PhD himself,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't know any other businessman
that would give me that long to come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with these methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the creativity I had from my art
background really did come in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was given the time to look into the
variables that impact test results that
[SPEAKER_00]: really has given us an insight into the
industry today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's that's one of the
things that we all really love about the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry is that it's such such a
frontier, such, you know, fertile ground
[SPEAKER_01]: for us to apply creativity and kind of
innovative solutions to really push this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea you had an art background.
[SPEAKER_01]: What what specifically you painter,
sculptor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, one of the miners is in
art history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking back at all the different time
periods and what drove art and what what
[SPEAKER_00]: the artists were thinking at the times
that they were creating the pieces that
[SPEAKER_00]: they created.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my studio art was centered first on
drawing and then on oil painting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to commission you to
paint a mural for us in the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my husband, it's funny, I recently
came home with something that I did,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he told me that we couldn't have any
more naked women in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently I'm not supposed to be doing
the live modeling in the studios for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while, but I still do keep up with it and
I do really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I'd have to check with HR to
make sure we could bring that into the
[SPEAKER_01]: into the mural, but not holding my breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I saw the picture of Kevin McKernan
superimposed over the Grim Reaper's face,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that's I think that'll be just
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some pretty, pretty heightened
artistic ability right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so wrapping up, here, I know you said
you were really excited to have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to Can Med, and we're super excited
to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember correctly, this will be your
first time out there, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I've been chomping at the bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Can Med is one of the most
scientifically revered conferences that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, Can Med and the Emerald are top
notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's an honor to be a part of the
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard nothing but great things about
it, and I look forward to the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions and the collaborations that
come about because of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're going to fit right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's plenty of people out there
who kind of share your enthusiasm for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, and I think you'll be a
great addition to the event, and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking forward to having you out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks again, Brianna, for taking the
time to talk with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, and if I don't see you before then,
we'll see you out there in Pasadena.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much, Ben.
