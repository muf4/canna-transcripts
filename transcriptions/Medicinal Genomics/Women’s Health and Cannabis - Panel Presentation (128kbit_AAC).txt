[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the Women's Health and Cannabis
Panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Meredith Birak and I was born
an activist and I've been investing in
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis science since 2011.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also the vice president of global
operations of Gainika, a subsidiary of
[SPEAKER_05]: Asana Bio Group, which is an Israeli-based
research and development company focused
[SPEAKER_05]: on women's health.
[SPEAKER_05]: This past week we received our official
license from the Israel Ministry of Health
[SPEAKER_05]: to conduct cannabinoid-based clinical
trials, clinical research on women's
[SPEAKER_05]: health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our first clinical trial, headed up by
Professors Lumiere Hanush and Moshe Hod,
[SPEAKER_05]: is on endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of conviction that not only
can we deal with the symptoms of this
[SPEAKER_05]: issue but get at the root of the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hopeful that Gainika will identify a
solution for this issue and move on to the
[SPEAKER_05]: next challenge for women's reproductive
health.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why all of us are here,
all of us here on stage this morning to
[SPEAKER_05]: discuss cannabis' immense, untapped
healing power for women's health and we
[SPEAKER_05]: are advancing knowledge, science,
and products to ensure women live better
[SPEAKER_05]: and healthier lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: I became interested in cannabis medicines
for reasons much like many of you here,
[SPEAKER_05]: because of pain and because of the
shortfalls in prescription medicine that
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't address my needs.
[SPEAKER_05]: My entry into the women's health began
when I was 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had such crippling pain from my
menstrual period that there was times that
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually thought I was going to die of
pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: My doctor's diagnosis was that I'm just
someone who simply gets bad cramps.
[SPEAKER_05]: She offered me prescription painkillers as
a solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: My choices were either to suffer in pain
or be inebriated from painkillers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either way, I wasn't functioning for a few
days each month.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my experience is not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_05]: 60 to 93% of the 3.8 billion women
worldwide suffer from painful cramps,
[SPEAKER_05]: also known as dysmenorrhea.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the US alone, 600 million working hours
or $2 billion annually are lost because of
[SPEAKER_05]: incapacitating cramps.
[SPEAKER_05]: On average, a woman has her period from
three to seven days, menstruates from ages
[SPEAKER_05]: 13 to 51, enduring 456 total periods over
36 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: This represents six and a quarter years of
her life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine living for more than six
years in constant pain?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were living for more than six years
in constant pain, wouldn't you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: address this issue?
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would only be introduced to cannabis
medicine another 12 years later in 2009
[SPEAKER_05]: when my mom was suffering from ovarian
cancer, one of the deadliest gynecologic
[SPEAKER_05]: cancers.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of the cocktails of medicine toxins
were working for her and none of the side
[SPEAKER_05]: effect medicines were working for her
either.
[SPEAKER_05]: As many of you understand, when it comes
to your own health or your loved ones,
[SPEAKER_05]: when the traditional Western medical
market doesn't work for you, you look for
[SPEAKER_05]: other options.
[SPEAKER_05]: These experiences inspired me to look into
the medicinal benefits of this
[SPEAKER_05]: historically prevalent plant and to invest
in its potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: Among the many things I've learned is that
the female reproductive system has the
[SPEAKER_05]: highest concentration of endocannabinoid
receptors after the brain, making women
[SPEAKER_05]: particularly responsive to the medicinal
properties of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: The earliest references to the
relationship between women's health and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis dates back to ancient
Mesopotamia.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about 2000 BCE.
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, women's reproductive health
accounts for only 4% of the overall global
[SPEAKER_05]: funding for research and development for
healthcare products and services.
[SPEAKER_05]: The majority of spending on diseases has a
male-specific research focus, even though
[SPEAKER_05]: 38% of women worldwide suffer from a
chronic disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, education and accessibility are
driving rapid growth in the women's global
[SPEAKER_05]: health market, yet the field remains
vastly underserved.
[SPEAKER_05]: But by 2025, the global women's health
market will rise to over $100 billion.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a $100 billion challenge for the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Women want scientific research and
products that actually benefit us and
[SPEAKER_05]: we're willing to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: alone, women by 2020 will control $22
trillion in U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: wealth and 65% of women who invest are
willing to pay for it or want to invest in
[SPEAKER_05]: causes that matter to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: What bigger cause is there than your own
health?
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that this is a rallying cry for
people in this room, for companies,
[SPEAKER_05]: for activists, for scientists to emerge
and address this $100 billion global
[SPEAKER_05]: women's health challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So without further ado, we're going to
hear from a world-leading scientist,
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Ethan Russo, who is also a historian
and one of the few historians on women's
[SPEAKER_05]: health and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ethan Russo is a board-certified
neurologist, a psychopharmacology
[SPEAKER_05]: researcher.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Russo is the director of research and
development at the International Cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: and Cannabinoid Institute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Previously, he was the medical director of
Phytex, a biotechnology company
[SPEAKER_05]: researching and developing innovative
approaches targeting the human cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before that, he served as senior medical
advisor, medical monitor, and study
[SPEAKER_05]: physician to DW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is the former president of the
International Cannabinoid Research Society
[SPEAKER_05]: and former chairman of the International
Association for Cannabinoid Medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: He serves as the scientific advisory board
for the American Botanical Council and he
[SPEAKER_05]: is author and editor of seven books on
cannabis and medicinal herbs, including
[SPEAKER_05]: Women and Cannabis, Medicine, Science,
and Sociology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why am I here, an old white guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, genetically, I'm a pale African and
according to that online gender quiz that
[SPEAKER_02]: I took, I'm definitely a woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think I'm kidding, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Meredith referred to, some years ago I
had the pleasure of writing an article on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis treatments and obstetrics and
gynecology, which was the lead chapter in
[SPEAKER_02]: this book, which is now out of print.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, all of the entries are available
by PDF and you're welcome to write to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: ethanruso.comcast.net if you would like
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: As previously mentioned, if we go back to
what the ancient Mesopotamia, what's now
[SPEAKER_02]: Iraq, we have the earliest reference I
know to gynecological treatment with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, what they called azalu,
was employed for staying the menses with
[SPEAKER_02]: mint and saffron in beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a common mode of
administration in medicines at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also from ancient Egypt, another
prescription, shemshemek, ground in honey,
[SPEAKER_02]: introduced into her vagina.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a contraction, presumably of the
uterus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll see substantiation for these
claims subsequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little physical evidence from Palestine
in the fourth century, this carbonized
[SPEAKER_02]: fragment was found next to the skeleton of
a 14-year-old young woman who died in
[SPEAKER_02]: childbirth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were THC metabolites in this
carbonized fragment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the supposition was that this was
burned so that she could inhale it as an
[SPEAKER_02]: aid to childbirth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Childbirth, which failed in this instance,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a representation, kind of both
some aromatic cane of what we feel was
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in the Bible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving up to the 19th century,
Fleetwood Churchill wrote some of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: famous works on obstetrics and gynecology
of that era.
[SPEAKER_02]: The property of Indian hemp of restraining
uterine hemorrhage has been extensively
[SPEAKER_02]: tried with considerable success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tincture of the resin is the most
efficacious preparation that would have
[SPEAKER_02]: been tetrahydrocannabinol predominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the same era, Alexander Christensen,
Indian hemp appears to possess a
[SPEAKER_02]: remarkable power of increasing the force
of uterine contraction during labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already see a dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis in early pregnancy prevents
abnormal contractions or miscarriage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Late in pregnancy, it augments
contractions in labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sir John Russell Reynolds was the royal
physician.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's often said that Queen Victoria got
cannabis since we're not privy to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Queen's medical records.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's never been substantiated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was her doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, Indian hemp is of great service
in simple cases of simple spasmodic
[SPEAKER_02]: dysmenorrhea.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same indication we hear today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morris Fishbine was the longtime editor of
the Journal of the American Medical
[SPEAKER_02]: Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 1930, he said, hence, a woman in
labor may have a more or less painless
[SPEAKER_02]: labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as is known, a baby born of a
mother intoxicated with cannabis will not
[SPEAKER_02]: be abnormal in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is actually used this way still in
Jamaica and many other cultures as an aid
[SPEAKER_02]: to childbirth.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a survey from 1999.
[SPEAKER_02]: 51% of Australians use cannabis for
treatment of premenstrual syndrome or
[SPEAKER_02]: dysmenorrhea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologies to Kylie Minogue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know why she was so happy
in this picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some modern figures.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's great and appropriate concern
about drugs in pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The expression is, no drug is the best
drug in pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, what are the real data?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is a meta-analysis that was
done a couple of years ago of 31 studies
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis use in pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when confounders such as tobacco were
excluded, there were no significance seen
[SPEAKER_02]: for low birth weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: These ratios generally need to be about a
two to be significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have a 1.16 or preterm
delivery, 1.08, this means there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: known statistical relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, cannabis use in pregnancy is
not an independent risk factor for adverse
[SPEAKER_02]: neonatal outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would add that neither THC nor CBD
have been found to have any teratogenic
[SPEAKER_02]: effect, meaning birth defects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Melanie Dreher, PhD, did a great deal of
work in Jamaica, particularly among the
[SPEAKER_02]: Rastafarian population, which at that time
used a great deal of cannabis but no
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had good nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their babies not only would have had
cannabis help in pregnancy with nausea,
[SPEAKER_02]: but their babies actually showed advances
in their cognitive development over women
[SPEAKER_02]: who did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was first reported in 1862 that
treatment with cannabis could allay
[SPEAKER_02]: hyperemesis gravidarum, the severest form
of morning sickness that often leads to
[SPEAKER_02]: fetal demise, even loss of the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wignie Lynn Curry wrote an entry in our
book, Women and Cannabis, about her
[SPEAKER_02]: success in using cannabis in pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was the beautiful baby that she
had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsequently, in 2006, there was a survey
done in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was an unindicted co-conspirator on this
study for political reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But 79 British Columbia women were
surveyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: 65% used it in pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: 68% of them used it for nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 92% found it effective or extremely
effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would remind you that this is
episodic use with no risk to speak of as
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to a situation where women are
routinely hospitalized with powerful drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: that are largely ineffectual.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a study that we did on patients
receiving cannabis from the federal
[SPEAKER_02]: government in the Compassionate Use
Investigational New Drug Program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patients A and D were women.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was menopausal and one was
pre-menopausal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at their endocrine parameters
and found that there were no derangements
[SPEAKER_02]: despite using up to 10 grams a day for
many years of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are the indications?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see the list here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Menstrual irregularity, menorrhagia,
dysmenorrhea, hyperemesis gravidarum.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the bottom of the list, endometria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to end with a summary on
endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot more ammunition, but this is
a summary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stimulation of GPR18, an orphan receptor,
increases cellular migration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is a key factor in the spread of
endometriosis, which tends to metastasize
[SPEAKER_02]: even onto the peritoneum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Endometrial biopsies revealed reactivity
for the TRPV1 receptor in women with
[SPEAKER_02]: endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a pain receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabidiol stimulates and desensitizes
the TRPV1 receptor and should decrease
[SPEAKER_02]: neuropathic pain in endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: CB1 and CB2 receptors were both reduced in
endometriosis over controls, highly
[SPEAKER_02]: statistically significant, pointing out
that this could be a clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid deficiency disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anti-proliferative effects, reducing
growth, and pro-apoptotic breaking down
[SPEAKER_02]: endometriosis effects were noted with
drugs that stimulate CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both THC and karyophylline should both be
effective treatments for that pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: and an ideal treatment getting at the
cause and the symptoms would be THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: With CBD and karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that's the last.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll go on to our next speaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next speaker is Rosemary Mesonet,
MD, PhD, as she calls it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your modern day real life wonder woman,
Chief Science Officer of Columbia Care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rosemary is a clinician scientist with
decades of experience in clinical
[SPEAKER_05]: development, healthcare investing.
[SPEAKER_05]: After training at the Brigham and Women's
Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer
[SPEAKER_05]: Institute where she was on clinical
faculty, she joined early AMGEN.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was given broad responsibilities to
leading several product development
[SPEAKER_05]: initiatives, including FDA panel
presentations, resulting in successful
[SPEAKER_05]: product approvals.
[SPEAKER_05]: She subsequently joined Oracle Partners
LLC in New York as a general partner and
[SPEAKER_05]: has been a presence in public equity and
private equity biotech.
[SPEAKER_05]: And specialty pharma since that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to serving as a life sciences
management and investment professional,
[SPEAKER_05]: Rosemary has served as a C-suite executive
at several companies and led development
[SPEAKER_05]: programs ranging from IND submission
through NDA approval and commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: launch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Her ability to conceive, articulate,
and execute strategic development and
[SPEAKER_05]: financial vision in public and private
company environments enables her to guide
[SPEAKER_05]: Columbia Care's research efforts,
including at many of the top national
[SPEAKER_05]: academic sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Among the many boards she participates on,
Dr. Mesonet is charter trustee at the
[SPEAKER_05]: University of Pennsylvania Health System
and is co-chair of the Leonard Davis
[SPEAKER_05]: Institute Executive Advisory Board at
Wharton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't write that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't write that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, I'm here today because I'm
interested in cannabis and I'm a baby
[SPEAKER_03]: boomer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm going to make a departure from
the previous remarks and I'm going to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: more about females who are actually the
patients that are buying the most medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis who are really the baby boomers.
[SPEAKER_03]: First slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have to make... Oh, I have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just hit this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big green.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am forced by my legal counsel to make
this disclosure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can't believe anything I'm
going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's sort of what I'm going to
say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Columbia Care is actually a national
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't update this slide constantly
because it would be too hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can just tell you the updates.
[SPEAKER_03]: This says that we're licensed in 12
jurisdictions in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's now 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably wonder why you really haven't
heard the name Columbia Care a lot if
[SPEAKER_03]: we're in so many states.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because even though we're
vertically integrated, each state was
[SPEAKER_03]: given initially its own name.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's Capital Care, Patriot Care,
Constitution Care, Columbia Care,
[SPEAKER_03]: SWC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of them, even though they belong to
the parent company, were given separate
[SPEAKER_03]: names because we didn't want the
government to think we were a cartel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the government now knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we work with the government very
effectively.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're doing is as every company
sort of comes on board with the formulated
[SPEAKER_03]: medical products that I'm going to
describe, they then become a Columbia Care
[SPEAKER_03]: name.
[SPEAKER_03]: We changed the name to Columbia Care
officially.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have about 30 facilities now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have more than 30,000 individual
patient interactions per month.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see 60 different qualifying
conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: In most of our dispensaries, we have
pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_03]: In New York, we have only PharmDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make a couple of tons of cured products
a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we now have more than 750,000
individual patient interactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I'm really interested in
the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in 2013, the company asked me if I
would get involved in making a patient
[SPEAKER_03]: registry so that every patient that came
in would have a mini medical record.
[SPEAKER_03]: And patients have been very compliant with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many states, we have that information
anyhow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other states, we've asked patients and
they've given us a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also know exactly what they're getting
in their product because we have to track
[SPEAKER_03]: the purchases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the point of sale, we mark down what
they buy and how often they buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we happen to know because we've been
doing batch analysis back to 2013,
[SPEAKER_03]: not only the THC and the CBD amount,
but the minor cannabinoid amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're getting to having,
you know, close to a million different
[SPEAKER_03]: interactions, you know, where you can see
what people bought, what they will buy
[SPEAKER_03]: next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why they change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to become very
interesting and I think help elucidate a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the mysteries that we have about
what minor cannabinoids are good for what
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things that was fascinating
to me, on the bottom here, you'll see our
[SPEAKER_03]: patients are really boomers, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: The average patient in New York is a 40,
I'm sorry, is a 58-year-old woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: The average patient in Massachusetts,
in Arizona, is a 45-year-old man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we're not seeing the
30-year-olds who we think of as,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, habitual users.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really seeing medical patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I show this because the qualifying
conditions and symptoms are sort of all
[SPEAKER_03]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the important thing to
understand is many of these have at their
[SPEAKER_03]: root an underlying immune dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we forget about that
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're giving plants to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Women actually have more autoimmune
dysfunction than men and suffer from those
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases more often.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really need to understand the
quality of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to make sure they don't have
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to make sure that there's no
fungal or bacterial product involved with
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we really need to be very
cognizant of the fact that most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: patients that we're treating, particularly
the women, have some immune dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just to give you an idea of the
types of patients that we see in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: New York, we have the largest database,
so that's why I focus on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see chronic pain, neuropathy,
cancer, inflammatory bowel disease,
[SPEAKER_03]: spinal cord, and then it goes down into
the smaller pockets very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about women.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just looking at all of the data that we
can cut, when we think about the percent
[SPEAKER_03]: female, multiple sclerosis is the number
one use that we see of women using
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The average age is 51.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, if you look at all of these
ages, you'll see that really we're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about boomers, or early boomers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cancer pain is next, chronic pain is
third, neuropathy, and then opioid
[SPEAKER_03]: reduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Opioid reduction is actually very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just in New York have gotten,
it's a qualifying condition, the ability
[SPEAKER_03]: to treat opioid addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is not a condition, this is opioid
addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're seeing is actually more
women are coming in looking for product in
[SPEAKER_03]: that case than men.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting, looking to actually
decrease their opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of other differences
between men and women.
[SPEAKER_03]: The preferred formulation, we find that
women, not surprisingly, don't like really
[SPEAKER_03]: the high THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30% is high THC, but 42%, 41, 42% is a
high CBD product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So women prefer CBD heavy product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be because they have more
inflammation as part of their disease
[SPEAKER_03]: states.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may also be some of the minor
cannabinoids that we're still analyzing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be back to you on that in two
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: The preferred forms of administration,
also not surprising, vaporization,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really very, very popular in men,
is not as popular in women.
[SPEAKER_03]: Women prefer the sublingual tinctures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also like the hard-pressed
tablets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see a difference in the types of
administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I think the women like products
that maybe give them an intermediate range
[SPEAKER_03]: of activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not so much the acute effect that you
get with a vape, they like the more
[SPEAKER_03]: long-term.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like the longer-acting effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, they have different types of
diseases in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things I just wanted to
point out is we have standard formulations
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've had for a number of years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the new things really are focusing a
lot on some of the women's things we've
[SPEAKER_03]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suppositories are very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have pediatric suppositories and adult
suppositories to be used rectally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also have vaginal suppositories.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see that they're
shrink-wrapped, childproof, everything
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're rolled up and put into a canister.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to be launching those very
soon in New York and then in all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: other states that were available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And topical lotion as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people like CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: We believe that a high THC product
probably has a lot of utility for pain as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have specially formulated products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, these can be used for women who
have a lot of eczema, who have some
[SPEAKER_03]: rosacea.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we know, there are a lot of conditions,
inflammatory conditions, that manifest on
[SPEAKER_03]: the skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're very happy that we'll be able to
treat women with a lot of these products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this is not just selling
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every patient that we see, every patient
that we sell anything to, we're tracking
[SPEAKER_03]: them with their permission to make sure
that we can understand what works for them
[SPEAKER_03]: and what doesn't work for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Rosemary, for this
introduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next speaker is Professor David,
nicknamed Deti Miri.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is an assistant professor at the
Faculty of Biology at the Technion Israel
[SPEAKER_05]: Institute of Technology, a member of the
Technion Integrated Cancer Center,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the head investigator for Technion's
Laboratory for Cancer Biology and
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabinoid-Based Research.
[SPEAKER_05]: Miri's lab is one of the largest
cannabinoid-based scientific labs in the
[SPEAKER_05]: world, comprised of 45 scientists.
[SPEAKER_05]: His lab is regarded as one of the leading
laboratories in the world that is
[SPEAKER_05]: exceptionally equipped to ask and answer
almost any question in the field of
[SPEAKER_05]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm speaking in many conferences
in Israel at least twice a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've never been in pressure like
that after introducing Ethan Russo and
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosemary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking, women health,
I was afraid that Meredith would introduce
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's married 20 years and had two
girlfriends before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is basically my connection to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have also two daughters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my lab started as a cancer biology lab
when we started three years ago to work on
[SPEAKER_01]: breast cancer and migration and how it's
affect blocking the ability of cells to
[SPEAKER_01]: migrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then reading work of Christine Sanchez
that should be here in the audience and
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking later today, we saw that it also
can literally fight the cancer and kill,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least in the plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a big difference between killing
cells in the plate to treat a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we saw a connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started to work on breast
cancer and ovarian cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the five minutes that I have today,
I don't want to talk about that,
[SPEAKER_01]: first of all, because Christine's speaking
later today and then I'm speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be enough about cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say that my lab grew in the last
three years to deal with many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many aspects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a neuro group in the lab that's
working on sleep disorders, on Alzheimer,
[SPEAKER_01]: on epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a group that's working on
autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that there is a big difference
between males and females, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: mice or whether it's people with the
questionnaires and things that we follow
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look on the endocannabinoid
system, today my lab have the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: look on over than 120 endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually people are talking about
anandamide and 2NG, but there is plenty of
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also there is many receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually we're talking about CB1 and
CB2, but Itair Russo just gave an example
[SPEAKER_01]: of GPCR 18, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a lot, at least 30 different
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the difference between male and male
and females on these endocannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_01]: huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still don't understand it, but it's
huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show a work that we did with
autistic kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We follow up 120 autistic kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Autistic kids in Israel that get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Autistic kids in Israel that get cannabis
getting high CBD, low THC strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to stone them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also these are very severe autistic
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these kids, very violent, usually
without even eye contact, a lot of time
[SPEAKER_01]: hospitalized because they are violent,
a lot of sleep disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw improvement in many,
many parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We checked 32 different parameters with
82% success in reducing violence,
[SPEAKER_01]: improve sleeping, reduce anxiety and other
parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we look on the difference between
male and female, it was astonishing to see
[SPEAKER_01]: that in male it's working perfect,
but in female it's almost not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Luke we can see habits, 53% improvement
in male, zero in female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Repetitive movement, 48% improvement in
male, nine percent in females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eye contact, 47% improvement in male,
zero in female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the difference are huge and we don't
understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is another example from totally
different area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking here on Alzheimer's mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we look, the green ones are the
plaques that create and cause the
[SPEAKER_01]: Alzheimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that in the control there is a
lot of plaques.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we treat with cannabis,
again in male we eliminate totally the
[SPEAKER_01]: plaques, but in female there is almost no
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see here the bars of many
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to say, I can bring more
and more examples in sleep disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things that we are doing,
there is huge difference between treating
[SPEAKER_01]: male and female, especially with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true for many other medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in cannabis the difference are huge,
especially because of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system that express different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least I don't understand what is
the cause of that and what is the reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there is a lot of research
that need to be done in order to learn how
[SPEAKER_01]: to treat better women and men because it's
a different type of treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next speaker, Stephanie Karasek,
born and raised in the suburbs of
[SPEAKER_05]: Montreal, worked as a copywriter in the
corporate world for over 15 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when she left the corporate world,
she came up with the idea for strain
[SPEAKER_05]: print, which she is going to dive deeper
into.
[SPEAKER_05]: She came up with the idea for strain print
after her first few months of using
[SPEAKER_05]: medical cannabis when she noticed how
little information and scientific
[SPEAKER_05]: validation there was on various
treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: In her spare time, Stephanie enjoys
spending time with her family,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially her amazing dog Brody,
who loves to walk and volunteer.
[SPEAKER_05]: If Stephanie weren't the founder of strain
print, she would be an on-air radio
[SPEAKER_05]: personality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I'm incredibly humbled to be
here in this room amongst all of you and
[SPEAKER_04]: on this panel with such an esteemed group
of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I'm incredibly nervous,
but I'll try and get through this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why am I here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm a patient, first and foremost,
and I'm also sort of a serial idea person,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is what Meredith was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always thinking about ways that we can
improve things, our lives, based on
[SPEAKER_04]: different ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my introduction to cannabis came very
unexpectedly in 2014 when I was at a very
[SPEAKER_04]: low point in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my life pretty much had been a
series of low points, up until that low
[SPEAKER_04]: point, since I had lost my brother in 1978
from leukemia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 35 years later, I found myself a young
mom with two children, and I couldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: function.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was paralyzed with fear that they were
going to also die, and I went to see an
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible doctor, a psychiatrist,
who turned me onto the idea of looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis because she had seen and read
some anecdotal studies on veterans who
[SPEAKER_04]: were treating their PTSD with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But she also did mention it would be more
of an adjunct treatment, so that I would
[SPEAKER_04]: be on a low-dose SSRI as well as trying
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm here to tell you that it changed
my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I started doing was journaling my
experiences with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was writing down everything that I
was experiencing every time I vaporized.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every time I was trying a different
strain, a different dosage, different time
[SPEAKER_04]: of day, what was going on, and I was
chronicling all that, and I brought it
[SPEAKER_04]: back to my physician at my three-month
appointment, and I showed him my journal,
[SPEAKER_04]: and his jaw dropped, and he did something
that I heard Dr. Sulak mention yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: He asked me if he could photocopy my
journal, so he could show it to some other
[SPEAKER_04]: physicians and some patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I said, yes, please do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And further than that, I went on about 150
walks with my dog, Brody, and I thought,
[SPEAKER_04]: there has to be a better idea here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There has to be something that I can use,
make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are inherently lazy,
and they don't want to document things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I came up with an idea for an app,
which is essentially a digital cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: journal, and that's called Strain Print.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at first, it is meant for a patient's
experience, so to be able to capture the
[SPEAKER_04]: treatment as you're experiencing it in
real time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the app is designed, sorry to change,
I go, sorry, I haven't used one of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green button, okay, got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so it is, as I said, it's a
journaling app, and it essentially is
[SPEAKER_04]: allowing patients to find out what works
best for them, which strains, which
[SPEAKER_04]: dosages, we are also very fortunate that
we are living in Canada, and we have a
[SPEAKER_04]: program called the ACNPR, which is our
medical program there, and all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: strains that we have are lab verified,
and we have a third of those strains have
[SPEAKER_04]: full cannabinoid and terpian breakdowns.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we're collecting this data,
so first and foremost, the patient is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be putting in the data into the
app.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's designed to be very user-friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the patient putting in a very
simple setup wizard.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna fill out which conditions
they suffer from, which symptoms they're
[SPEAKER_04]: treating, and it's gonna ask a very simple
medical pain scale rating.
[SPEAKER_04]: How bad is your pain now?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we're gonna talk about very
briefly is we looked at a sampling of
[SPEAKER_04]: female users who have tracked at least one
session for pelvic pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 332 women and PMS, 572 women.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are women who have indicated their
condition as being pelvic pain or PMS,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they're also treating for cramps,
pelvic pain, and we also see anxiety,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll see in a further slide,
comes up very frequently as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is, as I said, it is
self-reported, and it's in real time,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we have, because most of the users
here, our patients here are Canadian,
[SPEAKER_04]: we don't have access to some of these
incredible products that Dr. Mazanet was
[SPEAKER_04]: referring to, so you're gonna see that the
data looks a little bit different,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I still think there's something to be
gleaned from this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see that the women who are,
first of all, I do wanna say that we have
[SPEAKER_04]: a fairly even split of user base,
50% male, 50% female, but the women are
[SPEAKER_04]: tracking more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we see here that the women 30 to 39 are
more interested in tracking and learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just kind of an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We here see, try to make the slides look
pretty for you guys, that vaporizing is
[SPEAKER_04]: the most common form of ingestion here in
Canada right now, and again, this I
[SPEAKER_04]: believe is largely based on what we have
access to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna see, the numbers are
probably gonna change quite dramatically
[SPEAKER_04]: over the coming months as we get more
products, but oil and then other would be,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have patients that make their own
suppositories and their own topical things
[SPEAKER_04]: as well, so that's what other is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see here that, if you look here,
the efficacy by the method of ingestion is
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're seeing that users are going
predominantly for quicker, the
[SPEAKER_04]: vaporization is allowing them quicker
relief from their pain, whereas I think
[SPEAKER_04]: they would be happier to have a longer
lasting, but we're still in its infancy
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also wanted to point out here
that 45% of these women are reporting that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're also tracking for anxiety,
no big surprise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of comorbid
conditions and symptoms that happen
[SPEAKER_04]: because of the pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the strains right now that
are coming up as the highest efficacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now these are just names, they're not that
meaningful.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have full cannabinoid and terpene
breakdowns on these strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're able to determine that
alpha-pinene, beta-karyophylline,
[SPEAKER_04]: as Dr. Russo had mentioned, limonene and
mercine seem to be the common elements in
[SPEAKER_04]: these strains that are giving the most
relief.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, it's just in its infancy,
but we are very, very interested in
[SPEAKER_04]: learning more from these patients,
and hopefully we have a tool right now
[SPEAKER_04]: that is getting better and better,
and we're gonna allow these patients to
[SPEAKER_04]: ultimately tell our doctors what's working
best for us and help guide and inform
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I heard the time buzzer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean we have two minutes left
for the entire panel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you have one minute and a half.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first of all, I wanna thank CanMed
and the McKiernan's and Doug Kennedy for
[SPEAKER_05]: allowing us to be here and for introducing
this new session on women's health and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, which, as I mentioned,
could impact up to 3.8 billion women
[SPEAKER_05]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really appreciate your support on
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, given that we only have one
minute left, I will let this gentleman ask
[SPEAKER_05]: a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have only time for probably a couple of
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Alan Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a local cannabis physician in Santa
Monica, and the issue, I guess primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: for Dr. Mazanet and perhaps Dr. Rousseau,
it's been my experience by doing some very
[SPEAKER_00]: simple office studies where patients were
taking suppositories, both THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, and different dosing, and we measured
plasma levels of those cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were virtually zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's a lot of talk about
what the absorption is rectally and
[SPEAKER_00]: vaginally, and for the most part,
I'm seeing virtually no absorption which
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts for why these people don't become
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the tragedies, seriously,
of the whole cannabis field is that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can't do PK.
[SPEAKER_03]: PK is pharmacokinetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's looking at blood levels, plasma
levels over time to see how much actually
[SPEAKER_03]: goes across.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is sort of the thing that you do
for every drug that you're developing,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's so that you know how to dose it
and if it should work and when you should
[SPEAKER_03]: give it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has really been unbelievable that
we're not able to do this readily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that this is something that a
lot of medicinal chemists and a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: formulators think about a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have products that we know are
effective locally.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might not want them to be systemic,
but we don't have a way to test really for
[SPEAKER_03]: the local effect yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to standardize things a little
more, because patients really deserve to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to take something and know what to
expect and to know when they need to take
[SPEAKER_03]: it again and know that it's going to be
the same the next time they take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sympathize.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on how to convince the FDA
to let us do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a round of applause for our
panel, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
