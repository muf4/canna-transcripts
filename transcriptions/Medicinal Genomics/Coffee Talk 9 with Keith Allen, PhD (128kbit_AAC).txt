[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_02]: puts on the CanMed Conference every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's address the elephant in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've signed up for email alerts,
then you should have received an email
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday with an important update for
CanMed 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have not signed up for email
alerts, then please go to canmedevents.com
[SPEAKER_02]: slash coffee talk and do so now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The news is that our team has made the
difficult decision to postpone this year's
[SPEAKER_02]: event to the spring of next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: CanMed 2021 will take place April 12th
through 14th at the Pasadena Convention
[SPEAKER_02]: Center in Pasadena, California.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a faithful listener of the
podcast, you have heard me say that we
[SPEAKER_02]: were closely monitoring the COVID-19
situation in California and working with
[SPEAKER_02]: the Pasadena Convention Center and local
leaders to make sure we can provide a safe
[SPEAKER_02]: environment for our staff and attendees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our team felt moving the event to April
2021 would be the best way for us to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide a safe environment for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are offering a 100% refund to current
ticket holders should they have a conflict
[SPEAKER_02]: with the new dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to canmedevents.com slash COVID-19 for
more information.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good news is the CanMed Coffee Talk
podcast will continue with new episodes
[SPEAKER_02]: every other Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look forward to continuing the CanMed
conversation through this medium,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as on social media and on our
website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be announcing our safety keynote
presenter and expanded phase two schedule
[SPEAKER_02]: and new speakers, as well as multiple
panel discussions throughout the rest of
[SPEAKER_02]: this year and into 2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please sign up for email alerts if you
haven't already.

COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also follow us on Instagram,
Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just search for CanMed events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, with that out of the way,
let me tell you about today's guest,
[SPEAKER_02]: Keith Allen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keith is the Director of Bioinformatics at
Front Range Biosciences, where he is
[SPEAKER_02]: tasked with exploring the cannabis genome
to find genetic markers that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: selected in breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: His current focus is on cannabinoid and
terpene production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we discuss in our conversation,
there are a number of different traits
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and hemp breeders will want to
select for in the future, including yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: drought resistance, pathogen resistance,
flowering time, hardiness for the outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: The opportunity for improving the cannabis
and hemp plant is only restricted by our
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of the genome, which Keith
readily admits is still in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keith will be presenting on gene families
and gene networks underlying oil
[SPEAKER_02]: production and cannabis trichomes at
CanMed 2021 this spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please do consider picking up your
ticket for the event now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation with
Keith, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, the Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers Network is committed to providing
the highest quality cannabis content,
[SPEAKER_02]: education, and resources.

[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Keith
[SPEAKER_02]: Allen from Front Range Biosciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Keith.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you so much for agreeing to be a
part of CanMed 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the team here at Medicinal Genomics
has been an admirer of your work for quite
[SPEAKER_02]: a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really excited to have you
presenting this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm excited to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been on my radar for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, have you ever attended CanMed before?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would this be your first?
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be my first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we already have you secured and a
speaking slot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you could talk a little
bit about what you're intending to present
[SPEAKER_01]: to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm going to be talking about
started out as being about gene networks
[SPEAKER_01]: underlying oil profile and cannabis
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out I got a little bit
distracted on the way to getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm going to talk about is
really the gene families.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I could get to networks of
genes, I need to understand what the genes
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran into some kind of a lot more
complexity and a lot more interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: detail in terms of what's going on under
the hood in terms of the way trichomes are
[SPEAKER_01]: organizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The work that they're doing, creating all
of these compounds that make plants so
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say you were originally going
to talk about gene networks and now you're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about gene families, what's the
difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: So gene networks, you're talking about the
way genes interact with each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: either in a regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got genes that are responsible,
transcription factors, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are responsible for turning on a
particular set of genes or you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: other genes that regulate what's going on
in different ways, either by turning
[SPEAKER_01]: something up or destroying it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one kind of gene network.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other kind of gene network is a
biosynthetic network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoids are pretty big molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way cells handling making a
molecule like that is by assembling it
[SPEAKER_01]: from smaller parts, very standard,
very standard parts that it just makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: part of what we call core metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a sequence, there's a pathway
of genes that's involved in taking these
[SPEAKER_01]: very standard, plugged together parts and
building very, very specific large
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules like cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like an assembly line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a bit like an assembly line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only this one, every step is robotic,
but there seems to be about five different
[SPEAKER_01]: robots that could be working each step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know that all the robots are
the same or have the same priorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's gene networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's a gene family?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a gene family, you take a particular
kind, well, so here's a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabinoid synthases are members of a
large and very evolutionarily ancient gene
[SPEAKER_01]: family called the berberine bridge enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them a family because it's clear
that there was way back in the deep past
[SPEAKER_01]: before the fungi split off from the
plants, there was an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these enzymes, and they've
diversified now to do a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things, but they're all related in terms
of their history, their lineage back to
[SPEAKER_01]: this original enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in cannabis, the berberine bridge
family contains on the order of about 20
[SPEAKER_01]: genes that we would recognize as
cannabinoid synthases or very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very likely to be cannabinoid synthases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a bunch more of these
enzymes, some of which are pretty well
[SPEAKER_01]: expressed in trichomes that we don't know
what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we know is that it's probably a
molecule that's in the range of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: size as a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be an example of a gene
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things I hear so much in
talking to Kevin here, Fidicil Genomics
[SPEAKER_02]: and other folks who are kind of in this
space is, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much do we know about the cannabis
genome?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I peel back a layer of the
onion, it's a little bit like one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: Russian doll things, except instead of
taking it off and there's a smaller doll
[SPEAKER_01]: inside, you take it off and there's 50
smaller dolls, and they're all a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit different from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything about this genome is unlike
other genomes I've worked with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've slowed down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about the maize genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's maybe close to the same level of
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, this has been an intensely
neglected crop for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you compare what we know about the
cannabis genome to what we know about
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato, corn, soybean, for Pete's sake,
sweet potato, where entire academic
[SPEAKER_01]: careers have been sunk into studying these
other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you come over to cannabis and you're
really, really starting with stone knives
[SPEAKER_01]: and bear claws in terms of the amount that
we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have various genomes that are
finished to various rates of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have an initial run at annotating
these genomes, which is basically just
[SPEAKER_01]: going through and saying, here's a gene,
here's a repeat element and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just at the beginning of
starting to get a sense for how much the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome varies from plant to plant,
from cultivar to cultivar within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really my focus, getting into
specific gene families like the family of
[SPEAKER_01]: genes that create the early precursors in
the pathway to the cannabinoids or the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene synthases.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, how much variation do we see
in these from cultivar to cultivar in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of just whole blocks of these genes
being missing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing that new ones that we
haven't seen showing up as we sequence new
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also changes within the genes
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can reliably say, this is the THC
synthase or whatever, but every plant I
[SPEAKER_01]: look at, the gene is just a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount of variation in this genome,
particularly within the parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome that are relevant to the kind of
breeding we wanna do, the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: variation is amazing, that much we know
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the one hand, from the standpoint of
trying to study this genome, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: frustrating because I can't just write a
simple document that says the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genome is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, it's really exciting
because every time you turn around,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably most importantly,
from a breeding standpoint, breeding is
[SPEAKER_01]: about making, you're mixing up,
you have this line and this line,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this one has these characteristics you
like, and this one has these other
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna create a stable hybrid between
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has all the things that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about making combinations of
different genetic elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take a step back and look at
this variation rate thing, it means the
[SPEAKER_01]: number of potential combinations or
another way to look at that is the number
[SPEAKER_01]: of possible breeding targets that we can
get to with this plant is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you compare that to something like
soybean, where the amount of genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: variation within the breeding stock that
we have available to us, it's extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: limited what you can do with that genome,
because it's just very little,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a very, what we call a bottlenecked
genetic population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is absolutely the opposite
extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, to actually answer your
question, we are just at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding how much variation happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much of that genetic variation in
cannabis is just because it has been sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of on the fringes and hasn't had as much
intense study as say a soybean,
[SPEAKER_02]: or is it something that was always part of
the plant, or is it kind of due to
[SPEAKER_02]: circumstance?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of really not surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a complex question.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things, so if you look at corn,
for example, there's an ancestral species
[SPEAKER_01]: called Teosinte, and Teosinte actually
still exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow this stuff, you wouldn't be
able to, there's a way to eat it that has
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with like soaking it in lye and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a set of like a half a dozen
mutations that happened in Teosinte that
[SPEAKER_01]: turned it into something kind of looked
like modern field corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we've been breeding on that
all these years, and you drive across
[SPEAKER_01]: Iowa, and boy, I'm here to tell you
modern, what we're growing in Iowa right
[SPEAKER_01]: now doesn't look anything like what the
Inca and Mayan civilizations discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that on the range of a thousand
years ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an example where we've got the
product of a millennium of selection and
[SPEAKER_01]: now targeted breeding, and we've got the
wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, it seems like all we have is,
we don't have really, really good what you
[SPEAKER_01]: would call land races or wild relatives
that everybody agrees, yeah, this is what
[SPEAKER_01]: it looked like before human selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything, I mean, we have been doing
selection in this species really since the
[SPEAKER_01]: Egyptians.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very, very large number of
generations, plant generations have taken
[SPEAKER_01]: place while we've been selecting on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got kind of this crazy mismatch
of, we've been selecting on this genome
[SPEAKER_01]: and we end up with something that is
basically kind of a ways from what the
[SPEAKER_01]: natural genome would have looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that's going on is there's
been a lot of, it wasn't random in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of what individual breeders were doing,
but if you kind of like back up and look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the whole effect, it's essentially kind
of like random, all of this mixing of
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeast Asian strains and strains found
from various places around the world to
[SPEAKER_01]: create new varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have that aspect of it as well,
is that there's basically everything you
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up right now is a hybrid meaning,
this is a diploid organism, it's got two
[SPEAKER_01]: copies of the chromosome and those two
copies are very dissimilar to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I try to like breed this thing,
in my F1 population, all of the seeds are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another aspect where we're very
far behind the species
[SPEAKER_01]: where corn, I don't know how long,
Missouri 17, these old inbreds that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been reliable and understood and studied
for 50 years and we're kind of a ways from
[SPEAKER_01]: that in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, but I would think the potential to
breed a new and interesting strain of
[SPEAKER_02]: corn, that's gotta be pretty hard to do,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is to get to something that's really
fundamentally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what modern breeding and corn is
doing, so it's moving to very much more
[SPEAKER_01]: sophisticated mathematical models for
looking at the relationship between
[SPEAKER_01]: observable genetic markers and output
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically we're on this part of the
curve right now where for corn,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're increasing yield by about one and a
half percent a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still looks like the same plant,
but one and a half percent more than you
[SPEAKER_01]: got last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been a very reliable trend at
about that rate since about 1950 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know, we're gonna hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gotta be a theoretical maximum
someplace, but cannabis will be very
[SPEAKER_01]: different from that because we're just so
early in breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could flail around and fail to find
much that's particularly useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's gonna be the outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, at the other extreme,
we could end up really hitting pay dirt on
[SPEAKER_01]: some new combinations that we haven't
known to try yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, maize breeding is in many ways
boring and reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's general motors is just kind of
plugging along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis breeding is gonna be a lot more
exciting in terms of what are the kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we get out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the other thing to say there is
that in maize, there's two main traits
[SPEAKER_01]: that all of the big breeding companies are
focused on right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is yield period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second is drought tolerance or
yield under drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen use efficiency or uptake
efficiency is another one that's further
[SPEAKER_01]: down on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: You move over to cannabis and yield is
gonna be really important, but it's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated trait to breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drought tolerance is going to be
important, but I think that in the short
[SPEAKER_01]: term, the kinds of things we're going to
be looking at is creating stable,
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable lines that give you a very
specific oil profile under a given growth
[SPEAKER_01]: regime.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the market is the most looking
for right now, the end user market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also going to be what I think
we're gonna be best positioned to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to breed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying a consistent cannabinoid
terpene profile from generation to
[SPEAKER_02]: generation, that's sort of the first hill
to tackle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the first one that we're
going to be able to go after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you talk to growers, I mean,
there's a lot of growers out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: say, man, I've got this one variety and I
can sell every gram of this stuff that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can sell it at a big premium,
but I can't afford to grow it because the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall yield is so low.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can be done about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be things to do there,
but overall yield, we don't even know how
[SPEAKER_01]: many genes are involved in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's much more complicated to
design a breeding program and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably gonna end up modeled very closely
on what's currently been done in Mays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll just be gradual incremental
increases in yield year by year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, and that's fascinating when
you said that corn yield is increasing by
[SPEAKER_02]: 1% a year and has been since 1950.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can only imagine 70 years from now
what cannabis is gonna look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of cannabinoids and terpenes,
I gotta imagine that's intensely
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated as well just because,
I mean, modern testing labs can't even
[SPEAKER_02]: test for all the terpenes that the plant
is creating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where do you start there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the terpenes are very difficult for a
number of reasons, as a breeding target,
[SPEAKER_01]: as any way you wanna go at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big challenges with the
terpenes is they're volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they just evaporate and you got a
whole bunch of fresh bud and your curing
[SPEAKER_01]: protocol is to put it in basically a low
temperature oven for a day or two and just
[SPEAKER_01]: drive all the water out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be nice and dry and you're
gonna lose almost all of your terpenes out
[SPEAKER_01]: of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all of these variables before
your sample even gets to the extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: step in your testing lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That impact, the terpenes, they all boil
at different points.
[SPEAKER_01]: The modern terpenes are boiling in the
like 150 degrees Celsius range,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the sesquiterpenes are larger and
you're more like 225 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what that means is different molecules
are being depleted out of your sample at
[SPEAKER_01]: different rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking at the ratio,
between the ratio of mercine to
[SPEAKER_01]: karyophylline, for example, it's gonna
change depending on how you cure the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and how old the sample is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a nightmare scenario for a
breeding program where you would need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be going in and periodically checking,
do I have exactly the terping profile that
[SPEAKER_01]: I want?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's inherently difficult just because
this kind of experimental variability is
[SPEAKER_01]: built in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other aspect of this is that this is a
particular area of chromatography where
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got very complicated mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are dealing with different matrices
that they have to do the extraction from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of stuff that makes it
difficult to do these measurements really
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve Piltz seemed to do a particularly
good job of it, but you hear mileage is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna vary because this stuff is not easy
and we haven't standardized to like a
[SPEAKER_01]: global set of best practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: That everybody would adhere to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I speak with folks in the lab testing
side, which is one of the focus areas of
[SPEAKER_02]: CanMed, that's one of the things they come
back to all the time is the need for a
[SPEAKER_02]: standard to sort of get consistent results
from lab to lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully we'll see that soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things you sort of touched on
and it's not an exact core relation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I did wanna bring up to you this whole
idea of nature versus nurture as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: where the genes are only gonna do so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot's gonna depend on the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You place it in the type of lights that
you're providing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if you could comment a
bit on that and is there variation even
[SPEAKER_02]: between strains where some are more
sensitive to sort of those changes or is
[SPEAKER_02]: it universal?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so for a given genetic background,
you grow up this stuff and either it's
[SPEAKER_01]: completely genetically pure, well we don't
have that, so you do cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know, so you grow them indoors
and outdoors, you grow them under high
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow them outdoors in five different
fields or you walk a field outdoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: just look at if you've got a lot of
variation in the field and most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time when I'm out in a field, it's rare to
find a field that is really 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: homogeneous in terms of soil type,
the amount of water that the plants have
[SPEAKER_01]: available to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The various things that you're not shading
from wind, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a given genetic background is gonna
give you basically like a set of
[SPEAKER_01]: performance characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does this under these lights and this
under these other lights and this range of
[SPEAKER_01]: things when grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing you know for sure is it's
gonna be really different outdoors than it
[SPEAKER_01]: is in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to come back to that last part of your
question, that's something that's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: vary from strain to strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some strains, I don't know, some strains
are gonna be really good indoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just gonna be crap outdoors or the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have other strains that are
really a lot less sensitive to
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental changes than others and it's
just it all comes down basically to a
[SPEAKER_01]: complex interplay of the set of gene
networks working in each particular plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a data analysis perspective,
what you would most like to have rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than say here's the plant and it performs
like this, what you would have is a
[SPEAKER_01]: complete breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is in five different growth
environments and a half a dozen
[SPEAKER_01]: replications of each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know within each growth environment
how much does it vary and how much does it
[SPEAKER_01]: vary between growth environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of doing something like that
starts to get fabulous very very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to work with less data than
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and now is that something that could
eventually be sort of bred into the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: is to kind of have I guess more robustness
so they're not so sensitive to those
[SPEAKER_02]: variations like you mentioned out in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah once but targeted
breeding like that you need to know
[SPEAKER_01]: basically what are the exact genes or at
least what are the you know chunks of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can do a mapping and it just
says well it's this part of you know
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosome A is what it's giving us this
behavior but you need to have you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: know something like that and then once you
have that you can devise a molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: marker and you can follow it through your
crosses and breed for you know in this
[SPEAKER_01]: case you know robustness to environmental
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a prior step first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things you mentioned was you
know that a lot of commercial commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation right now is done with
cuttings and I imagine the goal is to
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually get to stabilizing seeds for
propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how far away do you think we are from
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some lines on the hemp side
that are relatively homogeneous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homozygous is the exact
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know for if we do it the
traditional by the traditional method
[SPEAKER_01]: which is years of what's called back
crossing targeted back crossing where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're you're monitoring you know am I
fixing meaning making this homogeneous in
[SPEAKER_01]: the genome am I fixing on the positive
gene variants the alleles and not what you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to avoid is fixing negative alleles
which is you know because what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: creating is an inbred line and the danger
with inbreds is you can be you fixed
[SPEAKER_01]: deleterious genes in there so the magic of
making good inbreds is being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow knowing enough about the genome
that you can breed something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doesn't have you know serious
deleterious alleles in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the traditional the old-fashioned way
to do that takes years you know depending
[SPEAKER_01]: on who you talk to you're gonna get
different numbers on on how long it would
[SPEAKER_01]: take but if you were just to do say you
know a half dozen back crosses you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be a fair amount of the way there
you could do that probably in you know two
[SPEAKER_01]: or three years but to get to really good
homogeneity is going to take longer than
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on the other hand there is a trick
called double haploids where you start
[SPEAKER_01]: with a haploid cell like for example a
positive pollen grain and you trick it
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a chemical trick that you can do and
regenerate a diploid plant from it that is
[SPEAKER_01]: now what you've done is you you you forced
it to go through a doubling without
[SPEAKER_01]: creating two cells and bang now you've
suddenly got a line that is exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: homozygous at every position.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called double haploid technology
and it doesn't exist yet in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't technically know if it's possible
in cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Sundento we got it going in Mays and it
was a nuisance but we had it running then
[SPEAKER_01]: we we tried and we have very good experts
working out we tried to get it going in
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato and just failed abjectly we ended
up licensing from another company in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands that had had gotten it working
so cannabis maybe you know it's it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be really hard to get it working it could
be really easy or it could be impossible
[SPEAKER_01]: but with double haploids that would
revolutionize a lot of things in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're actually taking pollen and
having it essentially breed with itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would be remiss if I didn't ask you
about your position at Front Range
[SPEAKER_02]: Biosciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your role there?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are what are the things that you're
working on?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am the the director of bioinformatics
you know we're a little startup so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: a that's a fancy term for for basically
you know the doing the main amount of the
[SPEAKER_01]: the bioinformatics work which is mainly
focused on gene discovery you know
[SPEAKER_01]: developing the catalog of the genes that
we'll care about for our breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what is your focus currently?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been focused on the terpene family
and right now I'm working on the the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid family both the the what we
call the terminal synthases that make the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual cannabinoids and the upstream
parts of the of the pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of other things that you
know along the way you know we're we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna get to you know disease resistance
obviously is one that you know there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: critical need for in cannabis but you know
basically I mean right now I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on the cannabinoid path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any cannabinoids in particular is it sort
of a combination of the the tried-and-true
[SPEAKER_02]: THC CBD or there's sort of other lesser
cannabinoids that you're interested in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah we're mostly interested in the lesser
cannabinoids in the so Front Range is
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on CBD dominant legally hemp
varieties and so you know one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that everybody in the field is is
very concerned with is not having your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants go hot that 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding what are the genes that
are involved in creating this extraneous
[SPEAKER_01]: THC a lot of times you're seeing this in
in varieties where the THC synthase gene
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like it should be stone dead so
there are other sources of THC so
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding understanding those but then
also there's a lot of interest in the
[SPEAKER_01]: other cannabinoids and for very good
reason I mean if if you only know one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing about pharmaceutical chemistry it's
that if you've got a family of related
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules and you know that two or three
of them are really super interesting you
[SPEAKER_01]: better go look at the rest of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabichromine is one of the more easy
to find but but also cvg strains the varin
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabin and THCV and there's a number of
these you know lesser cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know were were looking for plants that
make reasonable amounts of them but
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of there's a lot of
perfectly good-looking synthase genes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually expressed in you know in
flowers not at the same rate as as the you
[SPEAKER_01]: know as the CBD and THC synthases but you
know there these are real healthy genes
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'd like to know you know what do
these things do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent so you're very much focused on
creating you know high-yield resinous buds
[SPEAKER_02]: for terpenic cannabinoid production any
interest in sort of looking into hemp as a
[SPEAKER_02]: as a textile or for other uses beyond sort
of the pharmaceutical or nutraceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah yeah definitely definitely there's so
the there's various sides to like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the the economic argument in terms of you
know what is a profitable for the you know
[SPEAKER_01]: for the farmer versus other things that
they could they could be doing and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know so that that kind of drives like
where are the most important market
[SPEAKER_01]: segments for us to be looking at but you
know hemp as a fiber you know it's got you
[SPEAKER_01]: know this long list of really substantial
advantages and if nothing else creating
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties where you get say both things
going on at the same time you've got very
[SPEAKER_01]: good oil production and very good fiber
production you know that's something that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've talked about I think it's maybe more
likely that it's going to continue to be
[SPEAKER_01]: two very different kinds of varieties but
you know the short answer to questions
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that's you know that's obviously
another one that's that's you know the the
[SPEAKER_01]: other is is used to the as the of the
seeds as a protein source.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that's very fascinating stuff Keith.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can people learn more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can people learn more about about
your work in about Front Range
[SPEAKER_02]: Biosciences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's well let's see you can go to
the Front Range Biosciences website.
[SPEAKER_01]: For my terpene work I've got a paper out
in in plus one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you can go to CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand I'll be giving a talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and and I'm starting to kind of shape
out the profiles of another paper that
[SPEAKER_01]: will be focused on the cannabinoid
pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: When can we when can we expect to see
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh I'm not gonna make any kind of guess on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be sure to share that with everyone
and hey hopefully it'll be there in time
[SPEAKER_02]: for CanMed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a you can get a glimpse into
it.
