[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to jump into a different topic
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to change gears a little bit
and dive into genomics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for those who weren't here last year,
last year we had the great joy of
[SPEAKER_00]: presenting really one of the most complete
cannabis references completed to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there have been a lot of cannabis
references generated over the years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've generated some and many in this
audience have as well, and they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult to read, mainly because of
the complexity of the genome and it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: polymorphic and it's very AT rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we finally got an assembly put
together with Pacific Biosciences,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was really a day of joy because we had
not really seen what all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid genes look like in
relationship to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, today we're going to shift gears a
little bit and not talk about just that
[SPEAKER_00]: one reference genome that we built,
but we're going to talk about 42 more of
[SPEAKER_00]: them that we've since done, since we
started on this last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this was funded by a cryptocurrency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a talk that we did last year
describing how this was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a five-month grant that was voted
on by over 4,700 individuals around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world to contribute some cryptocurrency to
this project to actually sequence a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis genome, and this required about
five months of effort, and in 60 days from
[SPEAKER_00]: being funded, we put the first assembly
from Pacific Biosciences up on the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a 660 kb and 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're going to hear a couple terms
throughout this talk about how you monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: and assess the quality of cannabis
genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: N50 is a measurement of the average length
of the contig sizes, and you want these
[SPEAKER_00]: things to get to be about the size of
chromosomes, ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is rarely ever the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the first chromosome assembly for
the human genome just occurred last month
[SPEAKER_00]: on, I don't know, one of the smaller
chromosomes, and it's taken us like 19
[SPEAKER_00]: years to figure that out because the
sequencing technologies really just can't
[SPEAKER_00]: handle some parts of genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, after we put this public, we quickly
put up a pre-print to get the data public
[SPEAKER_00]: for everybody else after the August
release, and I think this one had an even
[SPEAKER_00]: more contiguous assembly, and that N50
number was out to past three megabases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other term you're going to hear
us talk about in terms of monitoring these
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes is a Busco score, which is an
evaluation of how many genes you should
[SPEAKER_00]: have in the genome that are seen in all
other plants, and if you're missing some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those, you probably have some
completeness issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we were seeing these genomes run
up to a 97% Busco score, which is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: silica way to tell you that your genome is
getting close to being done, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: the nail in the coffin is when other
people pick up the data and measure it
[SPEAKER_00]: with different techniques and come back
with very similar numbers, and so I think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some probably members in the
audience that were involved in this
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful work on the proteome where they
took cannabis proteomes or measured them
[SPEAKER_00]: via mass spec by doing a metabolite
profile, and from there they were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get peptide signatures they could map to
the Jamaican lion reference, and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: lo and behold finding that the Jamaican
lion reference produced the most number of
[SPEAKER_00]: peptides that matched their proteome data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Reggie and his team with Keith
Allen at Steep Hill also grabbed the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican lion reference and then annotated
all of the terpene synthase genes and
[SPEAKER_00]: recently published this paper in PLOS
about some unique features of the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that we now know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's novel in the cannabis genome is
that many of the terpene synthase genes
[SPEAKER_00]: have very long introns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a problem if your assemblies
are somewhat fragmented because you won't
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to piece these genes together in
the correct order or orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are 55 of the terpene synthase genes
that they studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cover the monoterpenes, the
sesquiterpenes, and I believe even some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the diterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still digging into the triterpenes,
which we're going to touch on a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: later in this presentation, but there's
great work here demonstrating that there
[SPEAKER_00]: is co-occurrence or co-expression of
certain terpenes like humulene and
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-carotene, and they're probably coming
from the same genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so with that said, if you want to
study the terpene synthase genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really have to look at the
chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because half of the pathway is inside the
plastid genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that with specific biosciences
sequencing, you really need very high
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage and long reads to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a depiction here of what looks
like 10 different chloroplasts that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we are expecting to find one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, two of these, I think we can rule out
that they're actually nuclear genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are what are known as NUPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of transfer of DNA from
chloroplasts to the autosomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as a result, you have to itemize which
ones are actually in the autosomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones are actually in the organelles
because the ones in the autosomes are
[SPEAKER_00]: usually silenced with methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a quick scan on these to look at
the depth of coverage we have across those
[SPEAKER_00]: contigs and then how much methylation is
actually present on those contigs so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can decide whether these are organelle
or silenced autosomal copies of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this does bring us back to some
questions about the nature of chloroplast
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always taught in biology class that
these things are circular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is when you have
sequencing capacity of this power,
[SPEAKER_00]: you capture these organelles in the
process of DNA replication live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you end up finding is not just
a perfect circular genome but a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydra where when these things are
replicating, there are all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: photocompetent branches coming off the
circle that have certain polymorphisms in
[SPEAKER_00]: them that we need to keep track of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we're paying close attention to
chloroplast genetics here is that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: look through a lot of the genome
engineering that's going on in plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vast majority of the yield
improvements are coming out of modified
[SPEAKER_00]: the photosynthesis pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving things from C3 to C4 photosynthesis
or modifying parts of this genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are seeing 50 percent, 40 percent
yield increases in a variety of different
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really have to understand the
chloroplast genome to get yield right and
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the terpene synthases done
correctly as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gentleman, Arnold Bendage,
had put out some wonderful papers showing
[SPEAKER_00]: that genomes really aren't circular when
you put them under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing the same thing with the
single molecule sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do the methylation Well,
this was done with New England Biolabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the thing about cannabis is it's very
hard to study its methylation patterns
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of the single molecule
sequencers out there aren't trained to
[SPEAKER_00]: look for these methylation patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much more complex than human
methylones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're still resorting to an older
technique known as bisulfite sequencing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which converts the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that has a non-methylated
cytosine gets converted to a thymine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your genome then gets peeled into two
different genomes and it goes from 66
[SPEAKER_00]: percent AT into 83 percent AT.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it really complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a read with short reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think only about 50 percent of the
genome is mappable once you do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, you can still study some
of the genes and understand what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on with methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So New England Biolabs developed this
methylation kit that has less bias in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of doing this assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we deployed it on five different
tissues from the plant, on female flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: female seeded flowers, male flowers,
leaves, and roots, so that we can get an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of what's going on
throughout this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most interesting thing that pops
out at you when you look at differential
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation throughout the genome is
methylation in the adestin gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the adestin gene is what makes the hemp
seed so nutritious.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the globular protein that gets
made in the hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we want to feed the world,
we need to understand how to hyper express
[SPEAKER_00]: this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's interesting about the
expression of this protein is you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is differentially methylated in
seeded flowers versus female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the female flowers get seeded,
they start making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they turn the adestin gene into high
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hypomethylate it, take the
methylation signals off, and let gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they want to shut it down,
they methylate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this silence is transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see these methylation patterns
in the beginning to correlate with the
[SPEAKER_00]: messenger RNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other gene you need to know about if
you want to feed the world is the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that stimulates people to eat,
particularly in cancerous scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see similar methylation
patterns there, where the male flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: have these little red bars here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those things are effectively
methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue bars up here are signifying
bases in the genome that are
[SPEAKER_00]: undermethylated or unmethylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so transcription is turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can look at just the methylation
signals on the DNA to understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: genes might be active and which ones are
inactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have different methylation than
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, there's CPG
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's CHG methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's CHH methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this means the pattern's a little bit
more complex to read than what we'd see in
[SPEAKER_00]: human genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you end up seeing if you look
at just flowers, like male flowers versus
[SPEAKER_00]: female flowers, you see a vast array of
differential methylation signals between
[SPEAKER_00]: the genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you move over to female flowers
and female seeded flowers, this picture
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes a little softer, because there's
less differences between the genes between
[SPEAKER_00]: those different biological events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you actually categorize them for
ones that are statistically significant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes that pop out are things like
adestin and some of the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase genes, like THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the methylation patterns are giving us
some picture of which genes are on and
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very simple survey that helps
complement anything you do with RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that does bring us to the RNA side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I jump on there, there's 500 to 700
different sites that are hyper or
[SPEAKER_00]: hypermethylated with very strong p values
that we're paying close attention to and
[SPEAKER_00]: combing through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you really want sequencing information
of the RNA to understand what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are these great new tools
from Pacific Biosciences that allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence an entire RNA molecule 50 to 100
times over as a single molecule to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better than Sanger data to annotate
genomes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something known as ISO-seq.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do this, what you're seeing
here is the number of laps that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting around the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turn these molecules into circles,
and they run like a gerbil on a wheel with
[SPEAKER_00]: a polymerase measuring incorporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can read this molecule over and
over and over again with these sequencers
[SPEAKER_00]: to get very high accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing down below is the
average transcript length that's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them are getting out to be 5 kb
genes, which is quite long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the average in there is
around 1 to 2,000 bases long.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this does, it gives us a picture of
all the different isoforms that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an isoform is a version of a gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any given gene can have multiple exons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those exons can be differentially
spliced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they're differentially spliced,
they create a different RNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each gene can have two or three
different RNA molecules coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we call an isoform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly enough, the male flowers
have more isoforms than the female
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in a habit of getting rid of
these things as fast as we can find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we might find some very interesting
biology in there that give us some pause
[SPEAKER_00]: on that genocide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else we can find from this is we
can take these RNA molecules, we can then
[SPEAKER_00]: map them to the reference genome,
and then identify where all the genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can annotate the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing is around 27,000
genes that are female gene models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives us an estimation of the
exome size inside cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 44 megabases of exome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 35 megabases of this that are
coding, because parts of exomes can be
[SPEAKER_00]: UTRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's 121 megabases if you include
the introns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is bigger than the human exome,
yet the genome is about a third of the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the human genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of an interesting adaptation
that we're seeing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you're going to do this
in females, you have to do it in males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just saw that males have more isoforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is taken all of the
RNA that we've done from those five
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues and mapped them against a male
assembly that we now have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can identify that there's even more
genes that are active in the male genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 32,000 of those genes and about
4,000 of them that are differentially
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also helps us decorate the Y
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see parts of the Y chromosome now
that are about 80 megabases that do not
[SPEAKER_00]: recombine with the X chromosome and about
30 megabases that is still recombining
[SPEAKER_00]: with the X chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to build any sex test,
you want to put it in the region of the Y
[SPEAKER_00]: that does not recombine, otherwise you'll
run into some trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, another great paper came out
from the Wordsburn Laboratory doing more
[SPEAKER_00]: mass spec on cannabis genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we soaked up those FASTA files and
compared them to the more recent
[SPEAKER_00]: references we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 98.8% of the mass spec data is
detected inside the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have the advantage of being able
to amplify RNA so we can pick up more
[SPEAKER_00]: really low incident events.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to amplify proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not surprising that the
protein systems are not finding all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: peptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're finding about 40% of what we see
in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a very high overlap with what
they do find as being real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these can be very complementary
tools because you can pick up like
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillation and other signals with the
mass spec data.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's look at a couple of examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a gene that has been studied
heavily by Jonathan Page called the
[SPEAKER_00]: penyltransferase gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved in taking alivatolic acid
and converting it into cannabigeric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can do it in two different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant predominantly is making this
form, CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're seeing in the genome is
that there are several cases of
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue-specific expression of alternative
isoforms, where we see two exons skipped
[SPEAKER_00]: in the female flowers and three exons
skipped in the male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may play some role in giving us some
alternative synthesized cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something yet to be resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's some other things people
always ask us.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other genes are being co-inherited
with the cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: These cannabinoid synthase gene clusters
have been shown to have very low
[SPEAKER_00]: recombination between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes you question what's in linkage
to squalibrium with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other genes are coming along for the
ride on those haplotigs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is the cannabichromine synthase
gene cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's eight copies of the gene,
all directionally oriented in one
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the boundaries of this gene,
we see melectin expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see ankyrin expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are genes that are known to be
involved in pathogen defense that seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: be going along for the ride with
cannabichromine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of an interesting little
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC synthase story is even more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, you see flanking THCS in the
genome are transposases.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are enzymes that copy chunks of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shuttle them all over the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably the reason why we have a
cannabinoid gene expansion inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These transposons are probably cutting it
and pasting it everywhere they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, within this same cluster,
are differentially expressed cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase genes that we don't know what
they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are getting differentially expressed
in different tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular one shocked us because
it actually has an intron in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most cannabinoid synthase genes are
believed to be one exon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start having introns,
then they can alternately splice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give you more combinatorics on
isoforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the first time we've seen an
intron inside of a functional cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase gene, at least one that's getting
expressed in frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see genome-wide is about 90 of
these different genes that have PFAM
[SPEAKER_00]: designation as a cannabinoid synthase
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of genes to comb through
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that stood out on the CBDS
contig.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's known as a
self-incompatibility protein that's used
[SPEAKER_00]: to prevent plants from self-pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have an obligate out-crosser,
you're going to probably want this gene so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't self yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is probably a historical remnant
of the hemp lines, which were known to be
[SPEAKER_00]: monaceous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we move to diaceous plants,
those things become obligate out-crossers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know what the function of
this is, but it's only expressed in male
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be very helpful to understand if we
want to understand hermaphroditism,
[SPEAKER_00]: because hermaphroditism is probably linked
into the split.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what you can see here is that this
cell self-incompatibility gene is
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue-specifically expressed only in male
flowers and happens to be right next door
[SPEAKER_00]: to CBDAS, including a bunch of other novel
synthase genes that are differentially
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed as well in a very
tissue-specific manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot to do to understand the
complexity of cannabinoid synthase genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can't just be looking in female
flowers to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to be looking at
multiple tissues to understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of that, we have to also look
at the male genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male X and Y chromosomes are the
largest chromosomes in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Y is actually larger than the X.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's on the Y chromosome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we did is we took the RNA off
of the male flowers, mapped it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: female reference genome we have,
and the reads that didn't map to the
[SPEAKER_00]: female, we would then map back to the male
genome to tell us which ones were
[SPEAKER_00]: male-specifically expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives you a hint as to what parts of
the genome are, in fact, the Y chromosome,
[SPEAKER_00]: because none of this stuff matches to the
female genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, female genomes can also have a
lot of structural variation in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this doesn't necessarily tell us that
this is all Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells us it's either Y or it's in a
structural variant in the female genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to touch on structural
variants in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this does give us a list of over 118
megabases of target genome that is
[SPEAKER_00]: differentially expressed or only expressed
in the males compared to the females,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a lot of gene content in there
as well to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you really want to resolve the Y
perfectly, the right thing to do is to
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence three genomes, what's known as a
trio.
[SPEAKER_00]: A brother, a sister, and their offspring
is what we chose to sequence here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's a bit of an inbred cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do this, you end up with
fairly routine N50s over a megabase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all cases, we did not do any
optimization here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically just purified high molecular
weight DNA, put it through the SQL2
[SPEAKER_00]: platform, and out popped 1.6 megabase
N50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a comparison of reference point,
the Human Genome Project went down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: White House to celebrate 500 kb N50s back
in 2000, and we're still waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: Donald's invite to celebrate this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm suspect it's coming anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of the busco scores are easily
above 97% just using a single method,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is actually really reassuring
because in the past, to tackle genomes
[SPEAKER_00]: like this, you'd have to deploy five or
six different methods to really kill it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's, I think, coming to a close
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the actual family of other
Jamaican lions that we've sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of these we hit with a short read
platform known as Illumina, and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeing above each one of these
genome pictures here is a coverage map
[SPEAKER_00]: across the BTBD allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genes that we just went over that are
coding for the cannabinoid synthase genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look at the coverage map across
those, you can predict what cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant's going to make, and that can be
seen in this little diagram here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can detect with this tool that's on
Canapedia whether it's going to be a type
[SPEAKER_00]: 1, type 2, type 3, or type 4 plant just
from the Illumina sequence coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have an active THC allele,
we know that it's going to make some THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's in combination with a CBD gene
that's not even in the genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know it's a type 1 plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When all three of these contigs are
present, we know it's a type 2 plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When only the active CBD contig's present
and there is no THC contig or a CBDS
[SPEAKER_00]: inactive, we know it's going to be a type
3 plant, and when none of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: present, it tends to be a CBG plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just looking at the coverage maps
alone, we can sort out its chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: expression, at least on those three
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that you want to do is
compare this to other type 3 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris Grasa is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And presenting later, I think today or
tomorrow, on a genome that's a type 3
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, a hemp line known as CBDRx.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we like to do is always align
the reference genomes that we have at
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica Lions, what other people have
found in other states and other
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions, to see that we come to some
level of consensus on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're beginning to see that with both
the male and female genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're seeing here is a contiguous
alignment of our genome to theirs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you see these diagonal lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those all represent the chromosomes,
the 10 chromosomes that you see in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're beginning to get genomes that
now share a lot of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next thing that we did is we took
40 genomes and sequenced them with
[SPEAKER_00]: Illumina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are shorter read systems that
can't get you to the whole genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can't get you all the structural
variants, but they can get you to all the
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs and the small insertions and
deletions in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this here is a histogram of the number
of variants that we see between the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jamaican lion genomes are here,
and there are usually 2 to 3 million
[SPEAKER_00]: variants between those siblings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get up into comparing those
to hemp lines, it jumps up to about 12
[SPEAKER_00]: million variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a perspective here, the human genome is
going to have about a tenth of the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of variants that we're seeing here per
cannabis line.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about a variant every 1,000 bases
in human.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one every 90 bases here in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a tremendous amount of
diversity here that we have to comb
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some sense of the insertions
and deletions from this data set as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can do when you have the RNA
data layered on top of the genome is you
[SPEAKER_00]: know where all the genes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can take the variant
information and ask, well, how many of
[SPEAKER_00]: those genes are broken by those variants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any frame shift mutations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any stop codons that are
disappearing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any start codons that are
changing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do this with a program known as
SNP EFF.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks at the impact of the variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just went through and asked,
how many high impact variants do we have
[SPEAKER_00]: per cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in humans, those numbers are
really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: In plants, like cannabis, there's over
2,200 high impact variants per cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot to understand about
what this type of diversity actually
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also take all of the sequencing
data from the Illumina platform,
[SPEAKER_00]: map all 40 of the genomes to the male
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see here are 40 genomes lined
up top to bottom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These top ones are male genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the density of
coverage across all of the contigs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting is the females have
none here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red means there's no coverage or at
least twofold less coverage than average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yellow is twofold or greater,
more coverage than average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instantly from a picture like this,
you can identify all the contigs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: present in the males, absent in the
females, present at half the coverage in
[SPEAKER_00]: the males, and double the coverage in the
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells you x and y.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got a list of all the genetic
content and the genes that are on x and y.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can begin to understand what things
are really related to hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of interesting genes that pop out
on the y.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some flowering loci we want to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a calcone synthase in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tricone gene involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Downy mildew resistance gene
that's involved in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of activity in the y.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to ignore that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing that popped out of
this data completely accidentally was with
[SPEAKER_00]: three of the genomes that are in there
from Colorado seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interesting cross they've done
that has some interesting properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was interesting about this is
there are these three hotspots that this
[SPEAKER_00]: to us is a copy number variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see something really bright
yellow on this map, it tells you it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without knowing that this plant was
powdery mildew resistance, we called them
[SPEAKER_00]: up saying, hey, we have regions of your
genome that are amplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they happened to map to a gene that is
powdery mildew resistant in hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know about this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing never gets powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's surrounded by it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to know more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't even looking for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just jumped out by looking at these
coverage maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be an interesting marker
that we want to track as we breed it into
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's touch on structural variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some time on structural
variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of you may be familiar with snip
chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snip chips are great for looking at single
base pair variants, maybe some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: small indels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you want to look at things that
are up to 50 base pair insertions and
[SPEAKER_00]: deletions, you usually migrate to
something like an aluminum sequencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great at getting some of the
indels up to about that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start getting larger than that,
it's very difficult to ascertain them with
[SPEAKER_00]: short reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need long reads to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important thing about doing this
with long reads is that the vast majority
[SPEAKER_00]: of the variant information in the genome
is usually the structural variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very frequent in terms of
their incident rate, but they happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: contain large chunks of DNA in almost
entire genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really need to pay attention to the
structural variants and get on board with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these long read sequencers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're seeing here is a graph of the
variant size and the cumulative percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of them that they make up in a genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that there are a
tremendous amount of variants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: large, like 10 kB in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And encompass a tremendous amount of
either regulatory elements or genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In humans, what you see is around seven of
these per megabase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this jumps order of magnitude when you
get in the maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 70 of these per megabase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the short read
systems have very low sensitivity for
[SPEAKER_00]: picking these things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're blind to these if we're only
using the aluminum sequencers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put in 20x coverage with these
long reads, you see them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes a really interesting story
that is represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see over 17,000 heterozygous
and almost 10,000 homozygous deletions in
[SPEAKER_00]: the male flower, almost an equal number of
those of insertions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, the offspring there has a
similar number of deletions and
[SPEAKER_00]: insertions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the histogram of the size of these
things is down here below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's clearly some kind of repeat
element in the genome that's jumping up
[SPEAKER_00]: and around 10 kB as being inserted and
deleted inside the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes you question what the heck is
in this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is just one inbred cross in a trio
and there's this much stuff jumping
[SPEAKER_00]: around, this is like an eighth of the
genome in structural variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is extraordinarily plastic when it
comes to a genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not necessarily containing boring
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing terpene synthase genes that
are in these structural variants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So TPS17 is a beta-mercine gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have other TPS10 and TPS30-like or
perhaps making alpha-pinene and
[SPEAKER_00]: delimitene.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the terpene landscape, a single gene
does not make a single terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: One gene can make multiple terpenes and
there can be multiple copies of that gene
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing the same terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just by this beta-mercine being dropped
out, doesn't mean it doesn't make any
[SPEAKER_00]: mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other genes that will probably
haplocompensate for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also see this in the triterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody is measuring for triterpenes right
now in the labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be looking at these things
because the flavonols are in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: people are publishing on how the
can-flavin genes are in fact having an
[SPEAKER_00]: impact in pancreatic cancer and in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet it's a molecule that the plant makes
that we don't track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, these other triterpenes seem to
have some interesting characteristics as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think we'd love to see those
getting into the analytical chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're tracking all of this stuff in a
website known as Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this system enables is for people
to sequence partial genomes or complete
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes and put the data public or hold it
private depending on their need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it allows you to compare that genome
to everything else we have in the
[SPEAKER_00]: database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get a phylogenetic tree of what
it's related to and what it's most distant
[SPEAKER_00]: to and how heterozygous it is and how
back-crossed it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also scan for the BTBD allele
to know what type of plant it is and
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's going to step on any
intellectual property that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of this is linked into a
blockchain system so that the time stamps
[SPEAKER_00]: and the notarizations are uneditable by
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we disappear, your data still has links
into a blockchain that is distributed
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world and your time stamps
cannot be changed by anyone at our
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're starting to integrate some
genome browsers into this as well so
[SPEAKER_00]: people can kind of peruse their genome
next to this is down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the 40 genomes SNP variant
file looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like there's almost a SNP at
every single location throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome when you put this many genomes in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you zoom in, it's not that sparse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, it can be a very helpful
tool for analyzing your genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, since the data up there is
public, there's been over seven
[SPEAKER_00]: publications that have just scraped data
off of that site and published their own
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been thoroughly vetted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's growing every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a few minutes left, I'm just going
to touch on what you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What applications can you do with genome
structures like this and sequences like
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first thing we started to do was
to build a fingerprinting tool that only
[SPEAKER_00]: needed 16 SNPs to identify cannabis
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want it to be 16 SNPs so we can do
it on a quantitative PCR instrument in an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to necessarily send it out
to a sequencing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can basically get parentage information
from 16 wells in a 96-well plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside that system that we built,
we also have that CBD and THC allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can measure the BTBD allele on a
plant with a genotype in a PCR well now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also makes you want to think about
doing RNA PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do QPCR and RNA of the terpenes or
the cannabinoid genes to understand at
[SPEAKER_00]: what stage of development are you getting
hyper or hypo expression of those genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're beginning to work on
viruses as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some great work that was published
by Dark Heart Nurseries recently on the
[SPEAKER_00]: hops latent virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've made an assay out of what they
discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also did a assay out of lettuce
chlorosis virus that was published in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel recently and threw in a third one
known as CCV1 so we can start to track the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be spreading through the
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two other things that we're
playing around with is some work with
[SPEAKER_00]: Arbor where we're making different panels
that can capture 1,000 genes or 50 genes
[SPEAKER_00]: at a time and sequence those so that
people can take more bite-sized pieces out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the genome and analyze them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This current one has the synthase genes
and the adestin genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have a booth here describing
this panel that they've built.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that was built off the
Jamaican Lion references.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also making multiplex tools to
measure the microbes that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down below there is just a five-color
aspergillus assay for tracking things in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final thing we're just toying
around with this really early is pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all this problems with pollen
floating onto open field cannabis farms
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are trying to do here is
quantitate the amount of male pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the air and the amount of
THC-laden pollen that's in the air with
[SPEAKER_00]: these $50 pollen traps that you can throw
in the corners of your property and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a lot of pollen that's blowing
in that might be destroying your grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: the next couple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot can be done with genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank all these people that
helped us do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dash really kicked off the snowballing of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then PacBio was pivotal in providing
the technology that could sequence these
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: New England Biolabs did a lot of the
methylation work and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing work on the NovaSeq.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done some work with phase
genomics and the other parties here to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually piece the genome in some more
contiguous shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of these people were required
to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does take a village and a
tremendous amount of collaboration,
[SPEAKER_00]: as Dr. Machulam was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I want to leave a few
seconds here for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If possible, and if not, we will roll over
to the next section, which I think is a
[SPEAKER_00]: panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
