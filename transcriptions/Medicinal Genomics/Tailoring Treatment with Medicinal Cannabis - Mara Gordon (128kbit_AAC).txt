[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for I know it's been a
long day everybody yawn stretch take a
[SPEAKER_00]: second to Increase your energy a little
bit here I'd like to start out by telling
[SPEAKER_00]: you just very very briefly what brought me
to cannabis and it was chronic pain I was
[SPEAKER_00]: a patient initially myself I had had
bacterial spinal meningitis that left me
[SPEAKER_00]: on 26 pharmaceuticals in a wheelchair on
fentanyl patch Neurontin many many many
[SPEAKER_00]: other horrible medications now I'm on
three and cannabis I will tell you right
[SPEAKER_00]: now that I'm a huge proponent of
pharmaceuticals when they're used
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly but I think that our doctors and
our medical community can do a lot better
[SPEAKER_00]: job of figuring out ways to treat people
using integrative medicine and not just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to their PDR to pick the next drug
and adding one on top of another so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I'm a testament to the fact that I'm
standing here instead of rolling up the
[SPEAKER_00]: aisle and able to talk to you coherently
and not be drooling and nodding like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: on the opioids so thank God for cannabis
in addition I'm very very excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: the work the court agents doing in
particular because I come from a family of
[SPEAKER_00]: you're pretty well if by the time you're
60 you'll have been diagnosed with one
[SPEAKER_00]: form of a cancer or another and there's
still using the same types of treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols they were using in the 70s the
80s the 90s the odds etc and there's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to be other ways or at least ways to bring
cannabis in with some of the results were
[SPEAKER_00]: saying I know that the conference topic is
primarily looking at neurological
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders but if you'll humor me I'm going
to talk just a little bit about cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: here because I think that it's something
that's not nearly addressed enough and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been having some casual
conversations here with some attendees
[SPEAKER_00]: some doctors they said you mean you use
cannabis for the side effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: palliative and I said well that too
depending on the objective of the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also use it to kill cancer so so
the question I'll be addressing is can
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis be consistently and accurately
dosed and the answer is hopefully clear
[SPEAKER_00]: from the show okay so the first thing I
want to talk about is the fact that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact promote whole plant extracts and
not isolates isolates do in fact have a
[SPEAKER_00]: role for standardization of medicines if
you have whole plant and let's say you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to standardize something to 60
milligrams per mil and it's coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: your your whole plant extract somewhere at
fifty five fifty seven fifty eight there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing wrong with using an isolate to
help to standardize to bump up the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have to have the entourage effect
you have to have the synergy between the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes the flavonoids everything else
that's in the plant in addition to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that are in there and even
the cannabinoids working together have a
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistic effect we know that mercy in
which is an old hippie trick of eating
[SPEAKER_00]: mango before you got high and it got you
higher and now we know of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason for that is that mercy and helps to
increase the bioavailability and break
[SPEAKER_00]: through the blood-brain barrier limonene
something that's in lines gives a much
[SPEAKER_00]: more uplifting experience we know enough
about the terpenes now to know which ones
[SPEAKER_00]: work best with certain people and certain
diseases but the one that think of a
[SPEAKER_00]: recurring theme that you've heard here
today over and over again is that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: no one size fits all one terpene might
make me very sleepy and it might make
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else very very activated so you
have to work very closely in communication
[SPEAKER_00]: with your patients to find out immediately
getting feedback with what works for them
[SPEAKER_00]: now the entourage effect is you know if
they've identified I hear sometimes I hear
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 different terpenes hundred different
cannabinoids sometimes I've seen reports
[SPEAKER_00]: that said 400 terpenes I don't know the
answer to it I'm not a scientist I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: actually an engineer so I come to this
from a background of data and wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: see patterns and wanting to see what
what's working and what's not working and
[SPEAKER_00]: take track you know look and analyzing
these things and looking for the patterns
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can tell you that with all these
various combinations I tried to run the
[SPEAKER_00]: formula last night of how many various
combinations if you just had two compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: present in any plant and you took the
hundreds of cannabinoid potentials and the
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of terpene potentials and you
added them together and you figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: which plant had it's a pharmacy in a plant
I mean every different combination will
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a different effect slightly
variance depending on who's taking it and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's going to impact them of course
but it is in fact I tell people have an
[SPEAKER_00]: infused CBD in your medicine cabinet have
a jar of flowers and then have an extract
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've got pretty well a whole
medicine cabinet a whole pharmacy in your
[SPEAKER_00]: in your bathroom now this is a slide that
I borrowed with her permission from Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christina Sanchez at Complutense
University where she talks about the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation of the cancer cells like what
actually is happening when it goes through
[SPEAKER_00]: the process of you know some not all but
some most cancer cells have go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: angiogenesis process and then they go
through and they go on and they
[SPEAKER_00]: metastasize and they spread and go on to
other other parts of the body and then of
[SPEAKER_00]: course that goes into the staging of the
cancers but the traditional treatments are
[SPEAKER_00]: designed conditional chemotherapy
treatments are designed to work on
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferating cells because your cancer
cells are met rapidly profilating cells
[SPEAKER_00]: within your body most of your cells are
not proliferating most of your cells are
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty well stagnant I'm not a scientist
I'm a doctor I can't explain more than
[SPEAKER_00]: that but I know that that's the
understanding as a result your hair falls
[SPEAKER_00]: out because your hair is continuously
growing you're nauseous you're vomiting
[SPEAKER_00]: because your stomach is your your
digestive system is is a constantly active
[SPEAKER_00]: thing so cannabis is found to work very
very effectively against the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have here like hair loss anemia
constipation diarrhea pain joint pain is
[SPEAKER_00]: in bone pain is very very big problem with
people that are going through
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapies the toxicity levels the
chemists can help quite a bit with and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of appetite in addition lo and behold
it also works on the tumor progression
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis has been shown to be very much
significant in apoptosis now the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids the CB1 or the CB2 receptors
are activated by the cannabinoids and it
[SPEAKER_00]: begins the chemical cascade that results
in apoptosis everything in between the top
[SPEAKER_00]: where the
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that goes between here and here
is up to much smarter people than me in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room to explain to you I just know it
does now I asked Christina I said Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sanchez I said could you please explain to
me what is the difference between necrosis
[SPEAKER_00]: and apoptosis because they both end up
with dead cells and she said the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference is that necrosis is like a car
wreck it causes a lot of damage the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: are caused damage to the surrounding other
cells and the tissues around it which
[SPEAKER_00]: results in inflammation which results
obviously in a negative prognosis which is
[SPEAKER_00]: why they have to be very careful at the
speed at which they kill cancer cells with
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy so that you don't have too
much necrosis going on and causing too
[SPEAKER_00]: much other diseases they'll end up
developing the body where apoptosis is
[SPEAKER_00]: cell suicide which is very intimate
experience it's very the cell basically
[SPEAKER_00]: collapses within itself and that's a
layman's description and and dies leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: behind and being being captured by the
other healthy cells so that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: leave behind any residue which causes any
disease and problem within the body the
[SPEAKER_00]: second thing I want to and then excuse me
and also the ID one gene is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: dr. Shawn McAllister has done work on
looking at which cancers that have ID one
[SPEAKER_00]: involvement ID one especially as a problem
I was speaking to one of the parents last
[SPEAKER_00]: night you know because of the ID one which
is something you see in infants newborns
[SPEAKER_00]: and fetuses and children it's something
that's when you have a lot of growth going
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ID one is very involved
unfortunately it's also present in quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: few different cancers the the good news on
that is that CBD is seen to be to down
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate the expression of the ID one gene
and the ID one is what causes when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: present you're going to have a lot more
proliferation and metastasis of the cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: cells so when we look for certain cancers
you know we can go okay let's start out at
[SPEAKER_00]: least like with a prostate cancer breast
cancer or something else and say okay if
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that it's a non small cell long
for example we might smart start out with
[SPEAKER_00]: a much higher level of CBD and lower in
THC than we would in one for example the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of glioblastoma multiform the
GBMs that we've looked at have not had ID
[SPEAKER_00]: one because they've not responded as well
to CBD sometimes they do and so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where the experimentation and the not
being one size fits all comes into play
[SPEAKER_00]: the second thing I'm going to talk to you
about today is chronic nerve pain and THC
[SPEAKER_00]: has been shown it has five mechanisms
involved with pain reduction the CB one
[SPEAKER_00]: and CB two activation I can read this to
you if you'd like me to retards
[SPEAKER_00]: electrochemical reaction at peripheral
pain receptors and I have had this
[SPEAKER_00]: explained to me multiple times interrupts
pain signal at the dorsal root ganglion
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupts pain signal at the neuron
activation of CB two at leukocytes
[SPEAKER_00]: triggers anti-inflammatory response much
like a steroid would do and the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive euphoric effects and
short-term memory reduction mitigate
[SPEAKER_00]: stress response to pain now why this is
really important is the same way as Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meshulam says that we don't want to walk
into a grocery store and remember 500
[SPEAKER_00]: people's faces that we see there we also
have the gift of forgetting is almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: having a break or having a freedom from
the suffering that we have it just gives
[SPEAKER_00]: us a break from it anybody who knows
anyone with PTSD and they have this
[SPEAKER_00]: recurring fight-or-flight response that's
going on they have the ability to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: break in that and have the the calm and
get out of that fight-or-flight and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the gift of the of the forgetting that
goes on the CBD in this case works
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory mechanism which works
very much like a cortisol hydrocortisone
[SPEAKER_00]: but with much much higher success rates in
many many cases I tell you myself
[SPEAKER_00]: personally I was having I have pretty
severe asthma and about once or twice a
[SPEAKER_00]: year I would have to go on as steroid as a
result of every time I got an airplane I
[SPEAKER_00]: got an upper respiratory infection you
know it always attacks the weakest part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the body and I would have to go on to
steroids and then it would take me months
[SPEAKER_00]: and months to get off of them with extreme
extreme bone pain and all sorts of side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects I have not been on a steroid now
for over three and a half years because of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis so all right here's just a visual
representation of the nerve okay so I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to show you how we do it so we started
collecting data on patients back into end
[SPEAKER_00]: of 2010 beginning of 2011 saying okay
nobody can tell you how to dose nobody can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you what's in the medicine nobody can
tell you how this works I mean we went
[SPEAKER_00]: around to some of the best places and the
best people and at the time there was like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they were beginning the testing
labs and they were still using gas
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatograph to do cannabinoids which of
course we all know it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylates in the process of testing
it so it's not an inaccurate it's not an
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate test if you're really trying to
know what milligrams you're taking you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: go to a dispensary and it would have a
rice crispy bar and a piece of cellophane
[SPEAKER_00]: that somebody stuck a piece of masking
tape on it and wrote one to 20 doses
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that meant there was no labeling
there was no understanding so we said
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna you know we can do better than
this there's got to be a better way that's
[SPEAKER_00]: when the engineer and me the process came
in to collecting the data we started
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting about 300 different data points
with patients and looking for patterns and
[SPEAKER_00]: what was working for various diseases and
seeing what if we could find a way to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to predict moving forward with
somebody else based upon various different
[SPEAKER_00]: variables what was going to work at what
for which diseases one of the interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we found was that there's five
questions that if we get those five
[SPEAKER_00]: questions answered we can do I mean
obviously the confidence level in our
[SPEAKER_00]: results there's going to be slightly lower
than it would be if we asked 300 data
[SPEAKER_00]: points but we found that if we find a
person's age because there's a I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have picked up on a pattern of this
today there's definitely a core relation
[SPEAKER_00]: between age and dose the younger the
patient the higher the dose the older the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient the lower the dose at least that's
the patterns that we've been saying so one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most important things that we look
at is the age then we look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis of course and if it's a if it's
a cancer or whatever it is we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: staging and everything else and other
treatments that they're having we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: all the pharmaceuticals and supplements
with the medications that they're on we
[SPEAKER_00]: also then look at their previous
experience with cannabis or cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy and then we look at what their
objective is because somebody may come to
[SPEAKER_00]: me and say you know I've got breast cancer
and blah blah blah and so I'm immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking okay we're going to put them on
this we're going to put them on that da da
[SPEAKER_00]: da we're going to start killing the cancer
they just want to they just want to not be
[SPEAKER_00]: nauseous and then you know what that's
their right it's not up to me to tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: what their goal should be with their with
their treatment that's a discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: between them and their doctor and frankly
we want to put this back into the hands of
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctors so we've been developing a
software all these years it's a CDR med
[SPEAKER_00]: it's now an alpha it's moving into beta in
fact I think the site just went up again
[SPEAKER_00]: last night to be moving into beta to help
to make it a conversation that a physician
[SPEAKER_00]: can be having now with his patients
instead of having to have somebody like me
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it I'm not qualified so the first
patient I'm going to look at here was a 43
[SPEAKER_00]: year old female that came to us with
breast cancer stage four and her goal was
[SPEAKER_00]: killing cancer cells that was absolutely
she wanted to live and she was going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it took to to live so the first
recommendation that we made to her now
[SPEAKER_00]: this was this was a while ago was 150
milligrams of THC and 75 milligrams of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: now when I say this is our first people
want to know where they're going in their
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment they may not ever get there or
they may have to go way past it but this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a starting out goal we can make
adjustments we start people out on a third
[SPEAKER_00]: of a milligram we've standardized our
infused oils at 10 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliter and it's between 28 and 30
drops per mil which means that each drop
[SPEAKER_00]: is one third of a milligram and that way
if we can start somebody out and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell very very quickly how high we're
going to have to go before we start having
[SPEAKER_00]: a therapeutic effect of course our
extracts are much much higher and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting ready to move them into
standardized as well it I believe 30 60
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not sure if there's another one in
there not milligrams per mil of major
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid so this was the first one the
doctor recommended 150 milligrams taken in
[SPEAKER_00]: two doses and then the CBD we also
recommend that people separate out their
[SPEAKER_00]: major cannabinoids and not take them
together when they're doing cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments CBD is a is an antagonist and
THC is an agonist so we want the agonist
[SPEAKER_00]: in there doing its job and and being
effective and we find a couple hours later
[SPEAKER_00]: you introduce the CBD there's still
synergy going on in the body but in the
[SPEAKER_00]: meantime we know that all the CB ones have
been activated that need to be we also
[SPEAKER_00]: want there to be beta carofalene whenever
possible so that we have the CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: activation as well so this was how we were
able to do it so how do we turn that
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation from a doctor or from a
clinician into results based upon what's
[SPEAKER_00]: available right now with the state of
products so the first thing we looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: was lab results this one happened to be
one that was done at Steep Hill Halent a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time ago it's doesn't matter the
point is if you have a good testing lab a
[SPEAKER_00]: good reliable testing lab and that's kind
of an oxymoron unfortunately at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: right now because there needs to be a lot
more standardization and regulation we
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend that people have their their
medicines tested multiple times at
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple locations to find out what really
is closest to accurate anyway in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular one the THC had 650 milligrams
per gram of extract and the ACDC which was
[SPEAKER_00]: the high CBD had 580 so by eight we were
able to then give them from the sour kush
[SPEAKER_00]: kief which you see here on this strain on
the left and on the right we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: then make us a recommendation to the
patient to take this instructions on how
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually take this medicine correctly
in order to achieve the exact 150
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams that was being recommended by
the doctor okay the second thing we were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do we were able to repeat it again
and again and again then the person was in
[SPEAKER_00]: remission we were able to move to a
maintenance dose of 100 milligrams of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point and only 50 milligrams and
what we do I asked the heard the question
[SPEAKER_00]: asked to the panel earlier that we said
that if after a person goes through two
[SPEAKER_00]: full cycles of showing any D then we will
then reduce them to between 10 and 12
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of what they're ever their highest
that's the goal to go on for a maintenance
[SPEAKER_00]: dose it looks like I talked too much at
the beginning so I'm not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: having a chance to show you but this is
how we then ended up were able to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: the maintenance dose for this patient and
then this is just showing the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: what they took throughout their the whole
treatment protocol and how they were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to consistently take the medicine through
this on the chronic nerve pain I just take
[SPEAKER_00]: one minute very quickly to show you we had
to go through a lot of experimentation
[SPEAKER_00]: with this particular patient we did it
with the cannabidiol and excuse me that
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC first 25 milligrams very very
quickly the patient just zoomed right past
[SPEAKER_00]: that to a hundred and that still wasn't
enough so we then introduced THC a into
[SPEAKER_00]: the picture the THC a because I'd rather
want to have that because they were having
[SPEAKER_00]: some stomach issues and we were able to
dose that accurately with these medicines
[SPEAKER_00]: fulfilling the doctor's recommendation
then we brought in then cannabidiol it
[SPEAKER_00]: turned out that a 80 milligrams of THC and
60 milligrams of CBD was the magic ticket
[SPEAKER_00]: for this particular patient and we were
able to redo it over and over again
[SPEAKER_00]: repeating that to keep them the same one
if you'd like for more information you can
[SPEAKER_00]: go to CDR med org and ask for beta access
I just you know I think I've covered
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much all these things we must have
clinical trials it doesn't need to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hands of people like me I'm glad that
my software is going to be able to put it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the hands for the clinical trials and
the doctors and all but I'm very very
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to be here and I'm very excited
about the work that I heard today thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you the patients every below the one the
chronic pain patient is that's their
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance dose and they're doing their
wife they're going to work they're having
[SPEAKER_00]: a lovely life and the breast cancer
patient is still in remission and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic yes mm-hmm thank you Mara you
you you you
