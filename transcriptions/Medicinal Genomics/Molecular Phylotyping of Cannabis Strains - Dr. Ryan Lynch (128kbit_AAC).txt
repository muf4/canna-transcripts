[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I'm Ryan Lynch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm certainly not a medical doctor or any
type of expert in healthcare.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do have a background in is
non-human, non-animal genomics,
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics, and biodiversity assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, as we've heard throughout all the
amazing talks today, it's clear that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the need to really understand the
source of all these different therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds and combinations of different
compounds that seem to be so compelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have any type of strong
personal story that got me involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more of an opportunity
scientifically and just sort of a general
[SPEAKER_00]: curiosity and an identification of just a
clear lack of study of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I've observed, and I think
what we've all seen, anybody that's worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plants, is that there's this
tremendous phenotypic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether that's the branching
structure, the leaf morphology,
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell, the bouquet, the aroma that
comes through from the terpenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, the perceived effects when you
consume it, or the therapeutic outcomes
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're hopefully going to be able to
nail down with some more carefully
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's clearly a lot of different types
of varieties of cannabis out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, given my background, yeah,
I decided that DNA sequencing and analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: would be one of the best ways to approach
some of these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little outline of, I think,
some of the best applications for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of it as there are ways to
look into the past, the history of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at least 6,000 years of domestication
and transport around the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly a lot of debate about
the different species name systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: nomenclatures, varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the operational functional
names that people associate with the
[SPEAKER_00]: indica and the sativa words, although
those date back to the 1700s from Linnaeus
[SPEAKER_00]: and Lamarck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think for me, the most interesting
thing, and it was really highlighted
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to all the wonderful talks
today, was more the functional side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can debate the taxonomy and
what you should call what endlessly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it probably won't be resolved anytime
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, there's probably,
you know, we should be just calling it one
[SPEAKER_00]: species at this point, but it is an open
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, you know,
we can leverage different layers of
[SPEAKER_00]: information to start understand,
you know, some of the underlying causes of
[SPEAKER_00]: these different chemo profiles that Mark
just very carefully described.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to take a lot of academic
discourse and modeling and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the more immediate present we can go
through and just clean up some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that we have with the names that
you're seeing in the various state
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important because patients and
consumers, you know, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations and they associate different
effects with these different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something that we can
immediately start to draw lines in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sand and begin to set some standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a side effect of that, you can also
start helping to establish proof of
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership at a certain point in time
through the sequencing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing I'll touch on at the
end, I won't really have time to go on
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but going big, scaling up,
developing new strains, automation,
[SPEAKER_00]: full agricultural genomics combined with
modern breeding techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an important caveat, I think that it's
important, I have to remind myself to
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes is, you know, the DNA is the
code of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the instruction manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue right now, and it's incredible,
the technological revolutions that have
[SPEAKER_00]: led us to be able to now, you know,
access every letter in that instruction
[SPEAKER_00]: manual many times over for, you know,
hundreds or just thousands of dollars for
[SPEAKER_00]: human and plant genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the case of the cannabis genome,
that's 800 million or a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have all that information,
but we're still at the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this isn't Jurassic Park or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like, it's important to keep
in mind that we're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take that digitalized information and go
in and recreate some type of unique
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, we don't even know,
you know, we can't even interpret what it
[SPEAKER_00]: would become.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, it's still really a developing
field in that sense, and it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to address some of those questions,
it's been an interesting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I started at the University of
Colorado, and, you know, just towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of last year, you know, transitioned
into the medicinal genomics, and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: this issue has continued.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting samples out of different grows has
always been a unique challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something where we can just pick
up a flower sample at your local
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and then take it onto campus
legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been some interesting stories
there, driving around with a trunk full of
[SPEAKER_00]: centrifuges and pipette tips and training
people that have been growing their whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lives to do these DNA extractions and then
dealing with barcoding and sample labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it hasn't been easy, but, you know,
this is just a small array of just one
[SPEAKER_00]: grow on medical dispensary in Colorado,
and there's some of the interesting shapes
[SPEAKER_00]: and leaflet blade morphologies and colors
that they had in stock at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a really quick overview on the
sequencing technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this the other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice white paper by Florigenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in the details,
I think this is a really nice schematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it does is it represents the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that dark blue line at the top,
and then it goes through all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: steps that it takes to do the sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the best to just look at
the bottom down there and compare versus
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genome shotgun sequencing,
which is what I started out doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fragments the original genome into
random little segments, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence all that, and then you realign it
back to a reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you can see, that does cover the
entire genome, but it takes more
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing runs to get that information
compared to the rad-seq restriction
[SPEAKER_00]: site-associated techniques that we're
using now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you counted the stacks, the number
of sequences in the rad stacks,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be fewer than the shotgun
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the important point there is that
these techniques have allowed us to
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence more samples and gain enough
information to do the analyses we're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in while keeping costs down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer some of the relatedness
questions that I find really interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think I have some direct
applications to most people involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry, I've relied on a series of
different methods to infer relatedness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of different models and
algorithms and so forth, but I just wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to point out some of the nomenclature that
we use to interpret the visualizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the obvious ones are the taxon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the samples, the strain,
or the variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the branch, which is
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you wanted to compare the
relatedness between, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: species D and E, you would add up those
branch lengths on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's important to keep in mind,
and it's a little bit misleading about
[SPEAKER_00]: these renderings, is that the distance on
the y-axis isn't actually included.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other point is rooted versus
unrooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a way of adding an extra
orientation to the order in which you
[SPEAKER_00]: think different taxa have diverged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with cannabis, we don't have,
well, we know that the nearest plant
[SPEAKER_00]: relative is hops, hemelis, but we don't
have the molecular reference tools to
[SPEAKER_00]: really use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the phosgenic trees I'll show are
unrooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing to keep in mind,
I pulled this off of icmag.com a few days
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, is that, you know, cannabis,
I mean, it has a very convoluted history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people have been doing this in
their basement for decades in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition era breeding and, you know,
moving these things around the world in
[SPEAKER_00]: very small batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the issue, of course,
on the production side where you really
[SPEAKER_00]: typically do not want a lot of pollen in
your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had a bottleneck in terms of male
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this schematic that was just put
together through somebody's recollection,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't know how accurate that might
be, but, you know, it really looks more
[SPEAKER_00]: like a web than a bifurcating tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a compromise we came up with was a
tool that allow, it's sort of a hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows inference of both network-like
structure, relatedness, and tree
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is from a paper that I did
with Nolan and the rest of the Cane lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally got it out into review,
so it was quite a battle with the editors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point here, there are,
of course, sample names on all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's about, it's just under 200
samples, and there's a full 4MB
[SPEAKER_00]: high-resolution version if you want to
check it out on the preprint server.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after a number of different close
clustering and structural analysis models,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were able to recover significant
evidence for three broad types of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we borrowed nomenclature from Rob
Clark and Mark Merlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we called those the broad leaflet
drug type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to zoom in on those,
you'd be able to see a lot of names that
[SPEAKER_00]: have Kush in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually some samples that we have
pretty good confidence were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: brought over from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are shorter, stockier biotypes
that we believe originate from the north
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the Hindu Kush mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you have that big spray kind of
from 11 o'clock all the way down to about
[SPEAKER_00]: 5 o'clock there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a whole mess of other
different varieties that we're lumping in
[SPEAKER_00]: as the narrow leaflet drug types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the most distinct one,
of course, are the European hemp groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are seed and oil fiber types.
[SPEAKER_00]: That do not typically get used in drug
type breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in any of the
names in there, I mean, some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, you know, we've been able to
recover clones from different states that
[SPEAKER_00]: are totally identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these are not so consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go into some more examples with
more recent data we've done at Medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: Geomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought that was a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: An old famous name, Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe there's a little cluster,
almost a hope for some type of consensus
[SPEAKER_00]: down there at 6 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly not the same thing from
every source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have any of the resolution
that Mark just showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were able to, in a way,
confirm some of the validity behind those
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic groups through looking at average
cannabinoid and terpene levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And between those three groups that we
recovered, we found some significant
[SPEAKER_00]: differences that are noted with the
brackets and the different levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: significance and the astracies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe not huge magnitude of differences
in the THC and the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do find some very interesting
hints that different genetic backgrounds
[SPEAKER_00]: may correlate to some of these different
terpenoid compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The linole and the diversity in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now at Medicinal, we're really looking
to ramp this up and go from dozens or
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of samples to thousands and go
from just what we could scrape together in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and maybe stuff people wanted to
send us in California to all the states
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's access and, of course,
beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is really just at the onset of
our launch for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been able to already make some
great progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing a rollout in Colorado and
California with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've really upgraded our version of
the RadSeq protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a very large chunk of
data from the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually 10 times more than I used in
my paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's going to be a great,
robust platform that can be developed into
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of different types of analysis
down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have a, actually, as of this
Wednesday in the Colorado state tracking
[SPEAKER_00]: system, there's going to be over 100,000
products that came from plants that we
[SPEAKER_00]: certified and tracked through all the way
from clone or seed to harvest and product,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's flour or MIPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something like I have some
other updates here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just came through 700 pounds of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just at 41 strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the capacity to do hundreds,
if not thousands, of samples per week at
[SPEAKER_00]: the quarter gym medicinal genomics
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to see what kind of
new patterns and stories emerge from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something Kevin touched upon,
I think it was last night at dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was trying to tap into just this
global community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've set up a website where we're
going to have different layers of
[SPEAKER_00]: information from our genetic sequencing
efforts and also our partner labs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to provide chemical analytics and
then also a more distributed open source
[SPEAKER_00]: section where we can get reviews and
different types of feed back and comments
[SPEAKER_00]: from everybody in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be rolling out step by step
through April and May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little, a couple little stories
from the latest data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That resolution got downgraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that popped out to me was we do
have some good chemical data from SC labs
[SPEAKER_00]: actually generated this for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see is that a lot of the
strains that are coming through with the
[SPEAKER_00]: higher elevated CBD to THC ratios are
clearly quite closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it suggests that there's certainly
room for improvement in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: intergressing that trait with some of the
other varieties out there that have
[SPEAKER_00]: different turpinoy compounds or other
traits of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be useful whether it's disease
resistance or yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I thought was interesting
were this cluster of green samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see the names there,
but they're all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genetic distances to me suggest
that we've picked up a breeder who's been
[SPEAKER_00]: using one male for a variety of different
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not like that makes those
varieties useless or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting and it shows some of
the limitations of the current breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques that have been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you guys can read that,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an example of just total strain
naming consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a snoops dream sample that was
picked up from a dispensary in Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, that ended up being
genetically identical to another variety
[SPEAKER_00]: that came out of Colorado medical
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Called blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know which one's which or what
was the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't say that from those data point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I looked it up on Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snoops dream is supposed to be a hybrid
between a master kush and a blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it's the blue dream that's
mislabeled here in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's going to be the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get more and more samples,
we'll be able to build case studies on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these inconsistencies and go back
and hopefully clean up some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just another little cluster
issue there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have kinatonic butane, butane and
the catatonic ACDC variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all genetically identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two were from California, one was from
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure what the original was
there either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll just leave you guys with this
little dream big here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something from Pioneer
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what this machine is is a corn
chipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they'll do crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way to accelerate breeding,
improve strains, novel traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: intergrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do crosses, dump the seeds in
somewhere at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cut out of the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labels each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotates it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes a little cutting off of the embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed's still viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stores the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA sequencing off of that little piece
that was removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide which ones you're actually going to
grow and do field trials on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genomic selection, marker selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's obviously a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But put that on the wish list for your
next grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick summary there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably over the time I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot of information
you can get out of DNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it isn't interpretable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of it you can't really get
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that we consider these
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also important that we work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we blend these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we layer them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genetic data without the chemical
data is a little bit thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together they can make some really
powerful tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we've heard in some of these
talks and some of the papers that have
[SPEAKER_00]: come out recently, this number changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm quoting 113 different
phytocannabinoids have been identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least 120 terpenoid compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the caveat there is, OK,
yeah, it's found on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant may not necessarily actually
synthesize all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Kevin brought up, there's certainly the
potential for some of the alterations in
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical structures coming from the
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's intriguing nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of room for
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
