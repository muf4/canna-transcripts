[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, big announcement to make at the top
of this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dates for CanMed 2020 2021 have
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year's event will take place
September 29th through October 1st at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pasadena Convention Center in Pasadena,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CanMed medical practicum will be held
on Wednesday, followed by the full
[SPEAKER_00]: conference on Thursday and Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: This decision was made after careful
evaluation and consideration by our
[SPEAKER_00]: management team and various state
officials, and it was done in the interest
[SPEAKER_00]: of safety so that we can hold a safe
in-person CanMed event.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sponsors and speakers announced thus
far have been notified of this change,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will continually update
CanMedEvents.com should conditions change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any current ticket holders who are not
able to make the new dates can receive a
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% ticket refund.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to CanMedEvents.com slash COVID-19 for
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that out of the way, let's get to
today's guest, Professor Rafael Machulam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Machulam is the first researcher
to isolate THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that achievement and the decades of
research into the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: that followed, Professor Machulam is often
called the godfather of cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since his research began in the early 60s,
Professor Machulam has received numerous
[SPEAKER_00]: academic awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently, the Harvey Prize from the
Technion Israel Institute of Technology
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Human Health category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty big deal when you consider
more than 30% of Harvey laureates since
[SPEAKER_00]: 1986 have gone on to receive the Nobel
Prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Machulam has presented at every
CanMed event, either in-person or via
[SPEAKER_00]: submitted video, and he is the chair of
our scientific advisory board.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our conversation, we discuss Professor
Machulam's incredible career, the
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointing lack of cannabis medicine
clinical trials, the surprising fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: the two major endocannabinoids,
anandamide and 2-AG, have never been
[SPEAKER_00]: administered to humans, the challenges of
researching the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: the benefits of cannabinoid acids,
the newly discovered anandamide-like
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that could be used to treat
addiction, and much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to that conversation,
I would like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Cannabis Science and Technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Science and Technology focuses on
educating the legal cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: about the science and technology of
analytical testing, quality control and
[SPEAKER_00]: assurance, extraction, cultivation,
and processing and manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In October, Cannabis Science and
Technology launched a new brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Patient Care, which is an
educational resource for patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and
caregivers on the latest research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research, benefits, and treatment options
cannabis provides for a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to CannabisScienceTech.com to learn
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, it wouldn't be the CanMed
Coffee Talk podcast without some good
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee, and for that we always turn to the
hemp and coffee exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know, hemp coffee is a
healthy, delicious, natural product,
[SPEAKER_00]: rich in trace minerals and nutrients,
providing sustained energy without the
[SPEAKER_00]: crash of regular coffee.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Rafael Machulam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, Professor Machulam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I want to congratulate you on the
Harvey Prize that you recently won for
[SPEAKER_00]: your life's work on the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well deserved and, dare I say,
long overdue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've mentioned in the past that there
was really not a lot of interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: exploring cannabis when you first got
started in the 60s, but what about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis inspired you to start
investigating it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you see, the chemistry and
pharmacology of morphine, cocaine,
[SPEAKER_01]: the other major addictive drugs,
these were known starting from the 19th
[SPEAKER_01]: century.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only the chemistry, but extensive
pharmacology, extensive knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was not the case of cannabinoids,
and the reason was that, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a chemical reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really big mixture, very difficult
to isolate the compounds, and two
[SPEAKER_01]: chemists, major figures in the chemical
field, had worked in the 30s, early 40s,
[SPEAKER_01]: and because of the war, they stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And later on, it was not taken up,
probably also because of legal reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: very difficult for an academic lab to work
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compounds that are legally restricted,
one probably has to have somebody looking
[SPEAKER_01]: around to see that students don't take it
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, very, very, there was one group,
not a major group, in Germany that was
[SPEAKER_01]: working, and maybe a few others,
but essentially, it was a field that
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody was working then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, as I said, morphine and cocaine,
chemistry, pharmacology, clinical,
[SPEAKER_01]: trials, were well known decades
previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it's a good idea to go ahead,
and I was lucky that I could get a hold of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assumed that I wouldn't have been able
to do that in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: because of legal reasons, and here I just
went to the police after a phone call from
[SPEAKER_01]: the administrative head of my institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked, can they depend on me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, without even knowing me,
said, of course you can depend on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went there, they gave me five kilos
of ashish, and we started work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt, very much doubt, that I would
have been able to do that in most other
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've mentioned that there was a
lot of work going into other drugs like
[SPEAKER_00]: morphine or heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: How come there was no concern studying
those drugs, but there was with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was not interested in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, I didn't have a group doing
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do that with my own hands,
and a friend of mine, the two of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: Yechiel Gaoni, we're close friends,
and this was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we couldn't compete with many major
groups working in anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that the best idea is to work on
topics that we can do without having a
[SPEAKER_01]: major group, without having a lot of money
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you started studying in the 1960s,
and when you did that, did you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would still be working on cannabis
today or that we would be where we are
[SPEAKER_00]: today?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that we'll do the chemistry for
a couple of years, and that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it turned out that we always found
new and new topics of quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to move along all the time,
and so the beginning of the 60s,
[SPEAKER_01]: early 70s, worked mostly in the chemistry,
and then under pharmacology and
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism, then a little bit later,
or quite a bit later, it was realized that
[SPEAKER_01]: there are receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went ahead and looked for compounds
that are formed in the animal body,
[SPEAKER_01]: animal brain, if you wish, and we found
that, yes, there are specific compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: that add, and here we had a new
physiological system, a completely new
[SPEAKER_01]: physiological system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody had done anything in it because it
was not known, and it turned out that it
[SPEAKER_01]: is of major interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, people at NIH wrote a
review at that time, I remember,
[SPEAKER_01]: and wrote that the endocannabinoid system
is involved in almost all human diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's a very, very it's a thing that
one cannot really accept so easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the major neurotransmitters like
dopamine and serotonin, one cannot say
[SPEAKER_01]: they're involved in essentially all human
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this being the case, there is a lot
of work, so we went ahead doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: additional chemistry, additional
pharmacology, to a large extent,
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials that we could do,
and so it developed and expanded,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you say it's sort of hard to imagine
that the endocannabinoid system is
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in every disease or every body
system, and it is quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what extent is it involved,
though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it essential, or is it sort of just a
contributor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it seems we don't know about all
diseases, certainly, but it is definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in many, many of them,
and so I can't really define whether in a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain disease is the central one or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to go and look at each one of
them, but it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we also have a problem, a major
problem, and it is that the two endogenous
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that we discovered,
an andamide and 2-AG, they have never been
[SPEAKER_01]: administered to a human, so what happens
is that we can only say, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: it works in mice in a model of a human
disease and so on, so we have a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but that's where we stand,
but even so, there is a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our paper, in which we described the
isolation identification of an andamide,
[SPEAKER_01]: has been cited more than 6,000 times,
which is very unusual for a paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the same is true for 2-AG,
2,000, 3,000 times being cited,
[SPEAKER_01]: so there is a lot of interest in whatever
these compounds do or whatever they are
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shocked me when I learned that an
andamide and 2-AG have never actually been
[SPEAKER_00]: administered to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the reason for that, especially
when there's plenty of examples of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, which are created by the
plant to sort of mimic these compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: have been administered, why not the real
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, in order for a compound to be
administered to a human, one has to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of preliminary things, a lot of
toxicology, a lot of other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: and for example, a drug, in order to be
administered to a human, one has to spend
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot, a lot of money, and this is done
usually by companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is no company involved because
there are no patents in these compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if we had patents, they would have
been, we published these things in the
[SPEAKER_01]: early 90s, so that's far away,
and so no pharmaceutical company is
[SPEAKER_01]: interested, and the governments do not do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have a strange situation,
which a compound, which is not toxic,
[SPEAKER_01]: or two compounds, which are not toxic,
which are very much involved in our
[SPEAKER_01]: physiology, which have a lot of effects
that are very relevant to what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These compounds have never been tested in
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strange, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I can't do it because we don't have
the amount of money needed for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do toxicology, and these things
cost millions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there we are, strange situation,
but there we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that almost seems criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems like a tremendous
opportunity missed, and that someone
[SPEAKER_00]: should really take up that mantle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what companies are doing,
they're trying to work on the enzymes that
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesize an andamide in 2-HG.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can block, and so the body doesn't
make an andamide, or on the contrary,
[SPEAKER_01]: they block the enzymes that metabolize an
andamide in 2-HG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the levels of an andamide in 2-HG go
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have something that is done,
not straightforward, a little bit in a
[SPEAKER_01]: strange way.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if somebody runs and gets
exhausted by running, so one would expect
[SPEAKER_01]: him to be, well, kind of, well,
not very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we know that there is a happiness or
something like that, and this is due to
[SPEAKER_01]: the enhancement of an andamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a person does a lot of physical
exercise, the anandamide goes up,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the person is in a better mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not a direct way of increasing
anandamide or if one gives cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: A group have found that if one administers
very high doses of cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this case to schizophrenic patients,
the cannabidiol acts on the schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty good anti-schizophrenic
compound, but its effect is also an
[SPEAKER_01]: andamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anandamide goes up quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's the mechanism, the effect,
but it goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one way of changing the levels
of anandamide in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a runner myself, I can say that I
get healthy doses of anandamide after
[SPEAKER_00]: every run, which keeps me coming back for
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smile after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was hoping we could maybe take a step
back for maybe people who aren't so
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you give sort of a brief explanation
of what are anandamide and 2AG doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the body?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is it beneficial to have good
levels of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't have a full picture of what
they do, but most definitely, they are the
[SPEAKER_01]: major compounds in the body that stimulate
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the endocannabinoid system is involved
in a huge number of disease states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the body produces anandamide when one
has pain, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without anandamide, the pain will stay for
a longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get pain, and then the body starts
producing anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anandamide around the painful place of the
body, and the pain goes down or in the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts on the pain effect in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: After all, if we have pain somewhere on
the body, the effect is through the
[SPEAKER_01]: central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anandamide acts on pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, this is one of the
major ways we lower pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anandamide does not stay around for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is produced when and where needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts, and it is more or less broken
down immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same is for 2AG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have a compound, which is a
reaction, if you wish, to physiological
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same is for many other disease
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really not produced unless there
is some sort of stress or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not stress, obviously, but also it's part
of our individuality, if you wish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there is a difference in
personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons for the difference
in personality is the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: A person with, let's say, a happier
personality may have more anandamide than
[SPEAKER_01]: a person that is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has to do with what we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, so where does cannabis play into
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the compounds in cannabis that
sort of mimic the effects of anandamide in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2AG?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't believe that Plant really
wanted to do anything to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces cannabinoids because of its
own needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, we are not different from most
animals in our physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our physiology contains a lot of
compounds, hormones, neurotransmitters,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, there's a horse, a pig,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not true for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants don't have the same chemical thing
as other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every family of plants or almost every
family of plants produces different
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that act for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, a certain plant is attacked
by some insects over the years,
[SPEAKER_01]: over the ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant has started producing compounds
against their specific enemies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every plant family has its own
group of compounds, which in many cases
[SPEAKER_01]: are specific for that plant or for that
plant family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with the cannabis group of plants,
there are two or three, they make
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds of this type.
[SPEAKER_01]: No other plant does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only plants that belong to this particular
family of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are produced for their own reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not exactly sure why they produce
them, whether it has to do with something
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with the soil they were originally
grown on or it's something that has to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with fungi or microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen that some of these compounds
have antimicrobial effects and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know exactly why cannabis
makes the compounds, but it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these compounds are specific,
and there are about 100 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two or three are the major ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there we stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in preparation for this conversation,
I went back and watched your CAM-Ed 2019
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation, which I will put in the show
notes for everyone else to enjoy as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at one point you were very,
very vocal about the need for more
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials in terms of whether it's
cannabis medicine or cannabis based
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, or even the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could speak to some
of the clinical trials that have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there were to be more future ones,
where should researchers sort of focus
[SPEAKER_00]: their efforts in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, quite frankly, it's a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shame that we don't have more
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: A huge, huge number of people take
cannabinoids or take a plant extract for a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of diseases, in most cases without
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that cannabinoids act on pain,
but pain is not a single symptom of a
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is pain from the different parts in
the body and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have large clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people take cannabis for cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, cancer is not a single
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many types of cancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there aren't any real major
clinical trials with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people are taking cannabis for
cancer without really any background,
[SPEAKER_01]: real background.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does THC or CBD act better on one cancer
rather than another one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Glioma, cancer in the brain, is not the
same as cancer of any of the different
[SPEAKER_01]: types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just people are taking them because
they've heard that that helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the 21st century.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should not be that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is that clinical trials
today, in the Western world at least,
[SPEAKER_01]: are undertaken by companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Governments are not doing clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, companies are not
involved because there are no patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the company does not want to spend
many millions of dollars or pounds or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever just to try something for a
publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have a situation which is
unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that the governments,
through their ministries of health or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, should do clinical trials
because nobody else is doing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And NIH normally does not do clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, I believe that NIH should do
clinical trials in order to know where we
[SPEAKER_01]: stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people say that cannabis can cure
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts on cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blocks in animals cancer development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has been shown that cannabinoids can
prolong the life of people that have a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain type of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no proof that it's an anti-cancer
drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that it helps along,
but it's not anti-cancer drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all these things have to be
investigated in human patients and not in
[SPEAKER_01]: animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like a common theme here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just not the investment from
companies to look into it because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot of opportunity for them to make
money on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what we need is some
philanthropic person to just donate a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole pile of money to investigate these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, all governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, after all, millions are using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government should probably look into a
problem that's a wide problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a few individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're speaking of millions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we need to get them on board
with decriminalizing it and descheduling
[SPEAKER_00]: it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess baby steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine another thing that's sort of
complicating the ability to do real good
[SPEAKER_00]: research into the effects of cannabis
medicine is this whole idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could speak a bit
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, most cannabis users say that in
total extract of cannabis is much better
[SPEAKER_01]: for them individually than the specific
cannabinoid CBD or KHC or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems that this is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have done a few investigations
along this line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, we have seen that apparently the
extract contains compounds that affect the
[SPEAKER_01]: THC or CBD actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, again, sorry to say that although
this is widely accepted and the term
[SPEAKER_01]: entourage effect, which we coined 20 years
ago, is widely used, but there are,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, no trials with even in animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know whether all the terpenes
that are present in cannabis together as a
[SPEAKER_01]: group have to do with the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only two or three have specific effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a pity because we could have much
better cannabis if we had the correct
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to imagine a compounding
complication there is just the variability
[SPEAKER_00]: in different cannabis strains or even
plant to plant of the same strain could
[SPEAKER_00]: have different concentrations of different
compounds just based on how that plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would imagine in order to do some
real research into what combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids is contributing to this
effect, you need standardized formulations
[SPEAKER_00]: to look into something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, one can imagine taking THC
with two or three or four well-defined
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes of flavonoids is better than THC
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all this has to be investigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has not been investigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of terpenes is quite large.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what terpenes are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although they differ, of course,
from cannabis satin and cannabis indica
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, in Israel at least,
cannabis patients are people that take
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, usually take cannabis indica in
the evening and cannabis sativa in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning because of the different effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have enough data to say why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting close to the end here,
I did want to give you an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak about what research you're doing
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we are working now mostly on
anandamide-like compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we published that our body,
in addition to anandamide, makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds which are chemically closely
related to anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anandamide is a fatty acid bound to a
derivative amino acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the body has quite a few fatty acids
and quite a few amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it makes a lot of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about, I don't know, something
like a hundred compounds of this type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not made by the body because
it has nothing else to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're made for a specific purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found, and we, it's always a
collaboration with pharmacologists and
[SPEAKER_01]: clinicians, found that one of these
compounds is very helpful in brain damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another compound we found is a very
efficient inosoporosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the last few years, again,
a few groups of friends, a group in the U
[SPEAKER_01]: .S., a group in Canada, a group in Italy,
and our group, together we are working on
[SPEAKER_01]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mechanism of addiction is not actually
well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many years it was believed that
addiction is the psychological effect only
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, over the last 15 years,
20 years, it has been recognized that
[SPEAKER_01]: addiction is actually a kind of a disease
and there are all kinds of changes that
[SPEAKER_01]: happen in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started looking together for the
changes that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were quite surprised to find a
compound that our body makes and tries to
[SPEAKER_01]: block nicotine addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started working on nicotine addiction
and have moved to opiate addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that there is a compound,
again, an andabyte-like compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a compound made from oleic acid and
glycine, two very well-known compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the amide of oleic acid with the
glycine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And OG, oleol glycine, blocks nicotine
addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't always succeed, but it blocks
nicotine addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The body makes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting, probably even more
important, this particular compound we
[SPEAKER_01]: found blocks the withdrawal effects of
both nicotine addiction and, much more
[SPEAKER_01]: important, of opiate addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was quite a surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many addicts are afraid to stop using
opiates because of the withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very afraid of the withdrawal,
which is really a very painful state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have a compound that our body
makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not enough, but it makes, and in animals
at least, blocks the withdrawal effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: both nicotine and opiates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that this will be investigated
directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company, as a matter of fact,
has been funding part of our efforts in
[SPEAKER_01]: this field of all four groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that we can contribute
something quite practical, which is far
[SPEAKER_01]: away from the cannabis in the plant,
but it's still closely related to an
[SPEAKER_01]: andabyte.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that this is something that will
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also work on derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabidiol, we didn't speak about it too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot, a lot of effects,
all of them positive, almost all of them
[SPEAKER_01]: positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works in a lot of disease states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we thought that maybe we can make a
more potent cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabidiol in schizophrenia, as I
mentioned, to you, has to be administered
[SPEAKER_01]: very high doses, about 800 milligrams a
day, acts on schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that was published by a group in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought that maybe we can make more
potent cannabidiols.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, we have synthesized quite a lot
of, and published quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiol derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them are indeed better than
cannabidiol itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the company or two companies are
working on cannabidiol derivatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could go back just for a minute to
talk about those anandamide-like
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, is it possible that there'll be
other compounds in cannabis that are
[SPEAKER_00]: closely related to that, much like happens
with anandamide?
[SPEAKER_00]: And THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anandamide and THC are almost
equivalent in their activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it's completely different
chemically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their activity is closely related.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major difference is that anandamide is
broken down almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't see in animals the same
effect that we see with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the effect, the basic effect is
essentially the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have compounds, let's say CBD,
acting like an endocannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they are different, but maybe
cannabidiol is mimicking, maybe it mimics
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the endocannabinoids, which have
not been well investigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said only anandamide and THC have
been investigated for quite a few
[SPEAKER_01]: additional compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe here we have something that has
to be discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still lots of work to be done,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that jumped out to me
when you were talking was this need for
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration and working with all these
different types of groups, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: near and dear to our hearts here at
CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what we try to do every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bring together everyone who is
working on this plant or working on this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and bring them together so we can
push everything forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to see that we're on the same
page with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in my view, it's essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like working with friends, with
colleagues, and it's essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the problems that come up with
anandamide, with cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: their chemistry, their pharmacological
effect, their clinical effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on, there isn't a single group that
can do all these things simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best thing is to do it with
colleagues and friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when there were meetings,
not any more personal meetings because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the corona, but we used to sit together,
drink a lot of coffee, shout at each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not throw stones at each other,
but shout at each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end, come up with a suggestion
together how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the addiction thing is probably
typical.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compound that acts on addiction was
identified by a group in Italy,
[SPEAKER_01]: my good friend DiMazzo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was investigated in quite a lot of
details in Canada, a group in the US is
[SPEAKER_01]: also doing work on it, and we've been
doing the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't believe that a single group can
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a problem this big, it's going to
take all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is to have good friends and
colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we can create a venue to
create new friends and colleagues at
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Professor Machulam, I want to thank you
again for taking the time to speak with us
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure and thank you for
everything you've done to help CanMed over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your questions, you asked about the
cannabinoid acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the time, I'd love to learn
more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you see the plant doesn't produce
THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant produces their precursors,
which are cannabinoid acids, which are not
[SPEAKER_01]: stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they are produced, they slowly
break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a cannabidiolic acid,
which forms cannabidiol, THC acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: which forms THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these acids have not been investigated
thoroughly because they are not stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a researcher cannot really work with
unstable compounds because he doesn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: whether the effects are due to the
original compound or the compound that has
[SPEAKER_01]: been formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we managed to stabilize cannabidiolic
acid and we worked with a stable
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiolic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out that it is of
considerable importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of effects and companies
looking at these effects and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do, again, in collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with some other effects of
this type, but it also has to do with pain
[SPEAKER_01]: and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is a lot of work going on now
in my lab together with friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that these compounds may
turn out to be as important as CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is it that they are more effective at
doing the same thing that the non-acid
[SPEAKER_00]: forms do, or is it just a completely
different effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to be more or less as CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, CBD acid, the stable CBD
acid, has turned out to be a very powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: in pain, more powerful than CBD by far,
more powerful than CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a colleague in Canada published that,
and he found that it's many, many times
[SPEAKER_01]: more powerful than CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But surprisingly, he found that it acts
better in essentially only male mice,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not in female mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's certainly interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be that we see more CBD A
products on the market in the coming
[SPEAKER_00]: years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: A company is working on those compounds,
and they support some of our work,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're trying to develop these
compounds, at least maybe some derivatives
[SPEAKER_01]: of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have not seen any toxic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that these compounds may
reach the public as official drugs in a
[SPEAKER_01]: few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, before I let you go, is there
anything else you'd like to discuss?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you mentioned at the beginning,
we thought that it's a small project,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it has turned out to be a major
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we started work, there was nobody
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are probably hundreds of
researchers, people that develop them,
[SPEAKER_01]: people that sell these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one never knows exactly what will
happen when one starts a new project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when students come up to me and say,
what should I choose to work on,
[SPEAKER_01]: a new faculty member, I always say,
start with the problem that nobody else is
[SPEAKER_01]: working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a better chance of succeeding
than being just one of a major group of
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are doing work on something that's
reasonably well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you again, Professor Michulam,
for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're most welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope to see you soon.
