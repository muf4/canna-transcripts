[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the results of your
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many different studies were you
able to look at and what were sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: main takeaways there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you said, our review looked at what
we considered to be next day effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we were looking to identify
any interventional studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So studies where either cannabis or THC
had been administered in some form and
[SPEAKER_01]: then participants have been required to
undertake or perform some kind of either
[SPEAKER_01]: simulated safety sensitive task.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like driving or there's some
studies on simulated aeroplane flying or
[SPEAKER_01]: some more sort of standard and common,
I guess, computerized cognitive tasks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a wide variety of those sorts
of activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to be included in the review,
studies had to have done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And measured performance at least eight
hours following cannabis use, because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's sort of what we considered to be,
I guess, your typical overnight recovery
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so studies, most of them administered
the tasks between sort of eight and 12
[SPEAKER_01]: hours following cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some administered all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often they conducted testing at multiple
time points.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might have measured at 12 hours and
then 24 hours and sometimes all the way up
[SPEAKER_01]: to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found a total of 20 studies that had
done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot were published quite some time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little bit of recent work,
but largely historical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they measured quite a number of
different outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was several hundred different
sort of or administered, sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: several hundred different tasks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's across all the studies at all
the different time points and under all
[SPEAKER_01]: the different cannabis conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often the studies would administer one
dose of THC on one study and a different
[SPEAKER_01]: dose on or sorry, one dose of THC on one
arm of one study and a different dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: a different arm in the same study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you end up with like, you know,
the amount of data sort of just increases
[SPEAKER_01]: exponentially as you start to include
these different arms and different time
[SPEAKER_01]: points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it turned out to be a reasonably
large undertaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's what we included in our
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were the results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you finding that people were impaired
after eight hours or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the vast majority of studies showed no
next day effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was across a variety of different
cognitive tasks and safety sensitive and
[SPEAKER_01]: safety sensitive, sorry, simulated safety
sensitive tasks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a small number of studies that
detected next day effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess an important element of this
review is not just to look at quantity,
[SPEAKER_01]: although they were overwhelming majority.
[SPEAKER_01]: Showing no next day effects, but also to
look at the quality of the studies and
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're sort of showing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we looked closely at this sort of
small number of studies showing subtle
[SPEAKER_01]: next day effects, they tended to be not
such good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of them were randomized controlled
trials, for example, which is our most
[SPEAKER_01]: rigorous form of interventional study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they often and they didn't tend to
have the ability to employ the best sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of standardization procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I mean by that is we're really
interested in making sure that the studies
[SPEAKER_01]: we were sort of reading into used didn't
allow their participants to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: consume alcohol 24 hours prior to
undertaking tasks, caffeine, stay up all
[SPEAKER_01]: night, all of those things that can go on
to affect cognitive function.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to be sure that they had been
controlled out of the sort of context.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the gist is that the studies
that did show next day effects which there
[SPEAKER_01]: were very few of tended not to be great
quality whilst there was a couple among
[SPEAKER_01]: those showing sort of no next day effects
that were quite good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that seems to be where the evidence is
at the moment.
So thank you for joining us.
