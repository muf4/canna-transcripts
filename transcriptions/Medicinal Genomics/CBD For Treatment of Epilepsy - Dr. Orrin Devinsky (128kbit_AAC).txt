[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Oren Davinsky from the NYU School
of Medicine and I'm here to present on the
[SPEAKER_00]: GW Pharmaceuticals Epidiolex trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these trials have occurred over the
course of several years and have now
[SPEAKER_00]: included both open label trials and
randomized phase three double blind
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to summarize mainly the data
from the open label trials and then give a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of data from the newly released Dravet
syndrome study which was a double blind
[SPEAKER_00]: randomized placebo control trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin with this second slide
summarizes our open label experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol or Epidiolex which was
presented at the American Epilepsy Society
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting in December of 2015 in
Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should start out by just saying that
Epidiolex is a commercial product produced
[SPEAKER_00]: by GW Pharma which contains 99%
cannabidiol in an oil base.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cannabidiol is a very lipophilic
molecule so it needs to be dissolved in an
[SPEAKER_00]: oil and that is the way it was given to
these children and young adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this first set of data that I'll be
presenting it is the largest and most
[SPEAKER_00]: complete set and included 313 children
treated at 16 epilepsy centers over a
[SPEAKER_00]: little over a two year period.
[SPEAKER_00]: These children and young adults included
261 individuals who received the Epidiolex
[SPEAKER_00]: for at least three months of continuous
therapy and that's important because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the standard time duration that we
look for in the FDA trials for both safety
[SPEAKER_00]: and efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the trials that I'm presenting here on
the open label data there was a wide range
[SPEAKER_00]: of patient age between four months and 41
years of age with a mean age of 12 years
[SPEAKER_00]: old.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doses that were used varied widely
from a low of two milligrams per kilogram
[SPEAKER_00]: to a maximal dose in some sites that got
approval from the FDA to go to higher
[SPEAKER_00]: doses of up to 50 milligrams per kilogram
per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I should emphasize for the vast
majority of patients the maximal dose was
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 milligrams per kilogram per day or
lower of the Epidiolex and for this group
[SPEAKER_00]: of the overall 313 patients epilepsy
diagnosis was unknown in 19% was Dravet
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome in 17% and was Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome in a few percent lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The median convulsive seizure frequency in
patients across this study was 48.8% and
[SPEAKER_00]: in Dravet syndrome patients 52.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients the
median reduction of atonic seizures the
[SPEAKER_00]: most paradigmatic and signature seizure
type for that syndrome was 71.1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the big caveat with this study and
I'll repeat it again is that it was an
[SPEAKER_00]: open label study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physicians knew what they were
prescribing and giving to the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents and patients who were aware of
it knew what they were getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were getting the actual labeled
compound in a jar that set Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they everyone knew what was being given
and what was being received.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no placebo group in this and there
was no blinding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have no idea from this data set what
the placebo response was in this group of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among all the patients that we treated and
that we had the duration of time of three
[SPEAKER_00]: months or longer 47% of them had a greater
than 50% reduction in seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as seizure freedom 9% of patients
overall and 13% of patients with Dravet
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome did obtain seizure freedom during
the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one of the things that emerged from
this open label experience is that
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who were on clobizam and then
Epidiolex or cannabidiol was added to
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy we did see increases in sedation
and in select patients for whom we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have enough to say this definitively but
we've seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Elizabeth Teal published this in
Epilepsia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Dan Friedman one of my colleagues here
at NYU published this as an abstract and
[SPEAKER_00]: presented it at the American Epilepsy
Society meeting a year before is that when
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol is added to clobizam in a
patient who's already taken clobizam we
[SPEAKER_00]: see elevations in the N-desmethyl
metabolite of clobizam and that metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: we believe is biologically active with
regards to both efficacy and toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a child or young adult is on
clobizam and we add Epidiolex to that
[SPEAKER_00]: child's regimen or young adult's regimen
we expect that in some cases we may we
[SPEAKER_00]: likely may see an elevation in that
N-desmethyl metabolite and that could lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to more tiredness for example as a side
effect and potentially could lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: greater effectiveness of the CBD through
this drug interaction mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some additional caveats about
this there are other drugs that can also
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibit the metabolism of this enzyme that
converts that degrades the N-desmethyl
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite and so other drugs that may
inhibit that include Steripentol which is
[SPEAKER_00]: also used in Dravet syndrome especially in
European patients but some American
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and Felbomate as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be patients with Dravet who are
on clobizam and Steripentol and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially Felbomate as well we don't
have the data yet to confirm this but
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen instances where we have not
seen an elevation in the N-desmethyl
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite when cannabidiol is added to
clobizam therapy and that may simply be
[SPEAKER_00]: because in those patients their
N-desmethyl metabolite levels are already
[SPEAKER_00]: quite high because of the co therapy with
a drug like Steripentol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an evolving story we need much
more data to define it but it is something
[SPEAKER_00]: to be aware of in clinical practice and
also in research methodology studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the presentation of the data at the
American Epilepsy Society meeting we did
[SPEAKER_00]: look at those patients who are on clobizam
co therapy because we think that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: important group to look at and indeed
there was a somewhat higher rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment response a median reduction in
the convulsive seizure frequency which for
[SPEAKER_00]: those who are already on clobizam was
56.4% versus 35% at week 12 for those who
[SPEAKER_00]: are not on clobizam co therapy and as I
said this we think may be in large measure
[SPEAKER_00]: because the CBD or cannabidiol induces an
elevation of that metabolite which is
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: However clobizam co therapy effect did not
seem to influence the efficacy results in
[SPEAKER_00]: either the Dravet or Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome groups and it may be because some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these patients were already on
medications that induced that were
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibited that conversion of that
metabolite or other mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again larger data sets will be needed
and we hope the randomized trials will
[SPEAKER_00]: shed light on this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regards to the safety of cannabidiol
the open label studies also provided some
[SPEAKER_00]: signals that we think were very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the adverse events that were seen in
at least 10% of the treated patients were
[SPEAKER_00]: somnolence in 23%, fatigue in 17%,
diarrhea in 23%, decreased appetite in
[SPEAKER_00]: 17%, vomiting in 10% and convulsions in
17%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The convulsion is an interesting one in
that it's hard to know because we did not
[SPEAKER_00]: have placebo controlled data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the natural history of
the epilepsy is in this specific patient
[SPEAKER_00]: group and so we know for many of the
children and young adults who were entered
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially all of them had very severe
treatment resistant epilepsies and for
[SPEAKER_00]: those of us in practice we know these
patients have bad days and bad weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: bad months and good days and good weeks
and good months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some of these patients what was
listed as a convulsion as a side effect in
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the investigators' views we didn't
list that as a side effect because we
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that was the natural history of
the disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas other investigators felt that any
difference from the baseline period should
[SPEAKER_00]: be listed as an adverse event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of variability in how
different investigators interpreted the
[SPEAKER_00]: same observations and again I don't think
any of us know what the right answer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is clinical medicine and how we best
attribute things we see to potential
[SPEAKER_00]: causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regards to the adverse events there
were 14 patients or 4% of the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: study group who had an adverse event
leading to discontinuation and there were
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 patients or 12% of those treated who
withdrew because of a lack of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition 16 patients or 5% of the
cohort reported serious adverse events
[SPEAKER_00]: that the investigator considered to be
treatment related.
[SPEAKER_00]: These included altered liver enzymes in
four patients all four of those were on
[SPEAKER_00]: valproic acid status epilepticus or
convulsion in four patients and I
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed the challenges of understanding
what their true relationship is I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think we can say definitively diarrhea in
four patients weight loss in four patients
[SPEAKER_00]: and thrombocytopenia in one patient and
that patient was also on co-therapy with
[SPEAKER_00]: valproate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to turn in the next set of
slides to discuss in the open label
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that was published in Lancet
neurology in December of 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: This represents a smaller group of
patients and a smaller number of centers
[SPEAKER_00]: and this was the first set of data that
was really curated and annotated that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could go through very carefully make sure
it was highly accurate that the
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies were consistent and so it
was able to communicate and be combined
[SPEAKER_00]: for publication in a high impact journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 11 centers beginning in January
of 2014 and going through 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: 214 patients with treatment resistant
epilepsy were enrolled and this overlaps
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely with the other set of data that I
just presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 162 patients who had at least
three months of continuous therapy for
[SPEAKER_00]: which we could derive good safety and
efficacy or I should say for here safety
[SPEAKER_00]: data and 137 of whom we had sufficient
data for the efficacy analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mean age in this group of patients was
10.5 years with a range of one to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started typically at two to five
milligrams per kilogram per day and then
[SPEAKER_00]: were increased mainly to 25 mgs per kilo
per day but in a few centers up to 50 mgs
[SPEAKER_00]: per kilo per day and this flow diagram
just shows the group of patients who are
[SPEAKER_00]: enrolled some were enrolled but did not
have 12 weeks of follow-up after their
[SPEAKER_00]: first dose of cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 stopped before that one due to an
allergy from the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One had elevated liver enzymes that
individual was on valproic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: One had somnolence and you can see four
had worsening seizures and poor efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: and the family decided instead of waiting
they really just wanted to exit the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are 162 left for the safety and
tolerability analysis and then we excluded
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 of those from the efficacy analysis for
various predetermined criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the outset we said we'd be studying
children one year of age and older.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were several children with
progressive disorders which were again
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusion criteria for the main protocol
and they were included for compassionate
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons and then there were 21 patients
who had no convulsive or motor seizures as
[SPEAKER_00]: we define them in the methodology for both
the protocol and the lancet neurology
[SPEAKER_00]: paper and you can read that in the methods
and so they were excluded from the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy analysis because they didn't meet
the criteria of the seizure type that we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to count and that left 137 for whom
we did analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a breakdown of the groups by
sex and you can see it was fairly evenly
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed between males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of background drugs which
ranged in anti-epileptic drugs from one to
[SPEAKER_00]: seven but averaged three and again quite
similar in the two group safety and
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy analysis groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas nerve stimulation was used in about
10 percent of patients ketogenic diet in
[SPEAKER_00]: about eight or nine percent of patients
and clobazam co-therapy was present in
[SPEAKER_00]: about half of our sample and then you can
see the range of seizure types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were focal seizures and 36 percent
of patients there were tonic seizures in
[SPEAKER_00]: 41 percent of patients atonic seizures in
about 20 to 23 percent of patients tonic
[SPEAKER_00]: clonic seizures in the majority greater
than 50 percent of patients and other
[SPEAKER_00]: motor seizures were identified again in a
majority of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next slide goes over the diagnoses of
the patients who were enrolled in the
[SPEAKER_00]: study that was reported in lancet
neurology and this includes drave syndrome
[SPEAKER_00]: in 20 percent of the safety group in 23
percent of the efficacy group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in 19 percent of
the safety group in 22 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy group and then you can see spread
out a number of other disorders from
[SPEAKER_00]: investigators who categorize the diagnosis
as minimal brain dysfunction, CDKL-5,
[SPEAKER_00]: tuberous sclerosis, epilepsy with
myoclonic absences, febrile infection
[SPEAKER_00]: related syndrome, otahara, Jevons and
several others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a wide range of patients but
drave and Lennox-Gastaut were the two most
[SPEAKER_00]: common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the side effect or adverse event
profile of the 162 patients that we
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzed and you can see on the top this
is very similar to what was reported
[SPEAKER_00]: before somnolence, decreased appetite,
diarrhea, fatigue, convulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some patients with increased
appetite were the main adverse events in
[SPEAKER_00]: more than five percent of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regards to the serious adverse
events, status epilepticus was reported in
[SPEAKER_00]: six percent of patients, diarrhea in two
percent, decreased weight in one percent
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a number of serious adverse
events in less than one percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to finish now with what I think
is the most exciting data to share with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was recently released as a press
release by GW Pharma and this is based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the phase three randomized placebo
controlled double-blind trial that
[SPEAKER_00]: involved a number of centers in both the
United States and in Europe and this was
[SPEAKER_00]: selectively for patients with drave
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Epilepsy Study Consortium and
Ingrid Scheffer doing the screening to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure all of the patients fit the
clinical and diagnostic criteria for drave
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 128 pediatric patients enrolled
ages two to 18 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 61 of those patients were randomized to
receive Epidiolex or Cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: 59 of them were randomized to placebo and
you can see the mean ages for the groups
[SPEAKER_00]: are essentially identical at 9.7 or 9.8
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: These patients had all treatment resistant
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an average of three concomitant
anti-epileptic drugs and they averaged
[SPEAKER_00]: having been treated with more than four
previous anti-epileptic drugs none of them
[SPEAKER_00]: in multiple combinations had controlled
their seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the median baseline of convulsive
seizures in this group of patients who
[SPEAKER_00]: were randomized was 13 per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again a high seizure frequency for a
very severe disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regards to the safety overall
Epidiolex was well tolerated and these
[SPEAKER_00]: data closely parallel the open label
experience that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adverse events that were recorded in 10
percent or more of patients included
[SPEAKER_00]: somnolence, diarrhea, decreased appetite,
fatigue, pyrexia, vomiting, lethargy,
[SPEAKER_00]: upper respiratory tract infection and
convulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: 84 percent of all adverse events were
rated by the investigator as being either
[SPEAKER_00]: mild or moderate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the serious adverse events there
were 10 in the Epidiolex treated group and
[SPEAKER_00]: three in the placebo group.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regards to discontinuation due to
adverse events Epidiolex patients eight of
[SPEAKER_00]: them discontinued due to side effects and
in the placebo group one discontinued due
[SPEAKER_00]: to adverse events.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regards to the efficacy which is
really the the exciting data because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is we had no idea what the placebo rate
would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a 14 week treatment period for
the patients who were randomized to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidiolex or CBD therapy there was a two
week titration period in which they went
[SPEAKER_00]: from no drug to 20 milligrams per kilogram
per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think in hindsight this was a
relatively rapid taper and probably a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the adverse events could have been
reduced or even prevented had we have gone
[SPEAKER_00]: with a slower titration period.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having said that there was a two week
titration period people on placebo were
[SPEAKER_00]: titrated to more placebo during that time
people on Epidiolex were titrated to more
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a 12 week period of
continuous treatment with the same dose of
[SPEAKER_00]: either Epidiolex or placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The median reduction of convulsive
seizures which was our primary outcome
[SPEAKER_00]: measure over the 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the data would actually look better if
we just looked at the 12 weeks where the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients were actually on the target dose
of Epidiolex 20 milligrams per kilogram
[SPEAKER_00]: but the data I will present is the agreed
primary outcome measure with the FDA which
[SPEAKER_00]: was based on the entire 14 weeks which
includes the titration period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for Epidiolex the median reduction
convulsive seizures was 39 percent and for
[SPEAKER_00]: placebo it was 13 percent and that was
significant at a level of .01.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very encouraged and excited by
these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very happy that the placebo response
rate was relatively low which we think has
[SPEAKER_00]: much to do about careful selection of
patients with Dravet, careful
[SPEAKER_00]: determination of the seizure type that we
would count in which parents and
[SPEAKER_00]: caretakers could be reliable and
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that the second study which
will be a dosing study of placebo versus
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 milligrams versus 20 milligrams per
kilogram per day will produce similar
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that hopefully this medication will be
available to children with Dravet syndrome
[SPEAKER_00]: and can improve both their seizure control
and their quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
you
