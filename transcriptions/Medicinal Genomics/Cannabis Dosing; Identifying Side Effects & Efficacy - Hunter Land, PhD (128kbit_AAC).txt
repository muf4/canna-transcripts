[SPEAKER_00]: And in looking at the results and you
talked about dosing, it seemed like there
[SPEAKER_00]: was sort of a sweet spot range for the
dose that really got the best effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't necessarily the highest dose
that got the best effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering if you could speak a
bit to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is we saw it across both
studies and botanical drug extract and an
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate and tau model and not tau model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not really surprising because we
do expect just about everything at a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain level to have toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we see actually CBG appears to be
less toxic in this model than CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: milligram per milligram.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, there's an LD50 for water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you go up, eventually something's
going to get toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would also say in terms of efficacy,
it's been a theory for some time about
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of inverted view or kind of
biphasic effects with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're more profound with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a narrow dose window for
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that low amounts or moderate
amounts increase appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may help with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may help with sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start giving really high
doses of THC, you get massive paranoia,
[SPEAKER_01]: nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a bunch of hospitalizations for
people that didn't know how much was in
[SPEAKER_01]: their brownie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as with these sorts of physiological
effects, you may see the same thing in
[SPEAKER_01]: lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking too much may be a hindrance or may
be neutral in terms of being of benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still don't know kind of where that
sweet spot would be, especially as it
[SPEAKER_01]: relates to CBD and CBG in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't necessarily apply the dosage
that was effective in C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a conversion there that you could
take in terms of what the dose would be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is a conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of complicated how you do it in
C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could actually look at the exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could spin them down and look at their
exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could use it as a correlate with
other compounds that have similar
[SPEAKER_01]: lipophilicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that 40 nanograms per mil,
or 40 nanograms, 40 micromolar,
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse me, is certainly a physiologically
relevant amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not the same as if I was doing work in
a dish, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're basically eating the
medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the concentration in their food,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not necessarily their exposure on the
cell level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see cancer studies,
oftentimes we're applying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be the cell exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of the food exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is relevant to their internal
exposure after metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
