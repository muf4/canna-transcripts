[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for getting up and offering your
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about pharmacogenetics?
[SPEAKER_07]: We all respond differently.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started a cannabinoid pharmacogenetic
company, but recognize the science just
[SPEAKER_07]: isn't there yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet there's a few companies that are
swearing that they have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the comments I have is I had a
chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my patients did do one of those
kind of cannabinoid genetic tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing that bothered me about it
was that on the paperwork that came back,
[SPEAKER_04]: it reported that her child was at a high
likelihood of becoming cannabis dependent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that really bothered me because she
was like, oh, now he's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: addicted and all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's really no evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, medical use, we're not talking
about addiction independence.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about an endocannabinoid
dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're trying to treat that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do one of those tests,
be very careful with what results you get.
[SPEAKER_04]: And make sure that you remember that just
because you may have a SNP or a gene,
[SPEAKER_04]: it does not necessarily correlate to what
your experience is going to be with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had talked to that company and said,
you need to remove that off of the test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, it's kind of like saying,
oh, you're 85 and you're starting cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: and you did this test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you're going to turn into a person
who's addicted to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's extremely unlikely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make sure that people
interpret those results carefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to point out that while our
genetics can point us in directions and
[SPEAKER_05]: give us a few clues about what might be
the case, there's this huge realm of
[SPEAKER_05]: epigenetics which are the factors that
turn on and off the genes and affect what
[SPEAKER_05]: happens when those proteins are expressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's just so much complexity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the idea that people are trying to
tie up these levels of complexity into
[SPEAKER_05]: systems that may eventually give us usable
data.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, as you mentioned,
we're pretty far from that right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a really quick comment on the
epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's largely affected by lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it comes back to the idea of
physiological context.
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly is happening in the system?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it bombarded by?
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of conditions has it been under?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to largely affect your
response to whatever it is, whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: stimuli we're talking about, whether it be
cannabinoids or pharmaceutical or any
[SPEAKER_06]: other compound.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome day, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for everything and your leadership
and mentorship through the years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm from Florida.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Dr. Barry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Barry Gordon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bonnie, you said something that was so
interesting to me that as California
[SPEAKER_09]: advanced out of their medical into the
legal adult responsible use stage,
[SPEAKER_09]: that actually the medical products were
harder to get, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's one of the things that we're
seeing in Florida right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in that middle zone where we're
still medical, but we know we're going
[SPEAKER_09]: towards legal adult responsible use.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who do you think are the best people to
impact to the extent of making sure that
[SPEAKER_09]: we maintain the medical program in Florida
to the excellence that we have now,
[SPEAKER_09]: the ratio products, the tinctures,
the suppositories, things of that nature?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what I found is that in many of
the states, as they go legal adult
[SPEAKER_09]: responsible use, the medical programs get
left behind.
[SPEAKER_09]: Second question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that it's legal in California,
have you ever given any consideration
[SPEAKER_09]: towards slipping a little sublingual five
milligram mint or something into the
[SPEAKER_09]: sublingual space while you're actually
examining your elderly patient for the
[SPEAKER_09]: first time?
[SPEAKER_09]: So that in that half hour visit with
family and patient, that they can actually
[SPEAKER_09]: experience that first time, so to speak,
intoxication of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first question is to who do you
address?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go to your government.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might behoove you to go as a group.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Society of Cannabis Clinicians is a
great group to use as a resource.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to repeat what happened
here in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we were the grand social
experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got passed by Californians and nobody,
the state didn't want to do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Politicians didn't want anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doctors called in law enforcement to go
after the doctors in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what really wasn't done very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what ended up happening here in
California is that we had a mandate to
[SPEAKER_04]: regulate medical and then legalization
came on the ballot and that passed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just so turned out that both needed
to be kind of completed programs by
[SPEAKER_04]: January 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our government said, well, we're not
going to do it separately.
[SPEAKER_04]: That will cost too much money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to do it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still think it should be separated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's a way to separate it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Colorado model, so to speak,
which has the Department of Revenue
[SPEAKER_09]: control rec.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So taxes on medical patients in California
can run anywhere from 20 to 35 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is taxed that high?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't pay that on your Prozac.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't pay that on your blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't pay taxes on your medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't understand why.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it just goes back to the fact
that our government still looks at this as
[SPEAKER_04]: a medical cannabis as a hoax, despite all
this time and all these reports and that,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, yes, select.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this patient, it might help.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that little child, it might help.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they don't really realize because they
just don't live in the world that we live
[SPEAKER_04]: in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your second question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not allowed to dispense cannabis in my
office, so I cannot medicate my patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I did have a patient that came in
with lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was terribly nauseous.
[SPEAKER_04]: She could barely keep her head up.
[SPEAKER_04]: She actually put her head on my desk and
then we had her go lie on the bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And her adult son said, I have a bag full
of stuff I bought that I have no idea what
[SPEAKER_04]: it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But can I give something to my mom?
[SPEAKER_04]: We gave we there was a little vaporizer in
there again before all the vape nonsense
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going on now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we broke it open and we gave her a
puff.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave her a puff in the office.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And within minutes, she had color back in
her face.
[SPEAKER_04]: She hadn't said any, you know,
when you're so nauseous, you can't talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: She started talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was smiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: She walked out of my office so happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So my point is, I'm looking for
strategies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shouldn't I be allowed to give somebody
medicine to give her this medicine again?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to get it off the schedule.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, to me, when it becomes legal,
you know, to a certain extent,
[SPEAKER_09]: it would be interesting if you could do
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do that for the first time in the office.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Susan Sklar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm local here in Long Beach in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two clinical questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is a patient with autoimmune hepatitis
and fibrosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been talk about some of the
cannabis products doing something about
[SPEAKER_03]: fibrosis in the liver.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second one is I treat patients,
women, with a condition called burning
[SPEAKER_03]: mouth syndrome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a neuropathic pain condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do very well on hormone restoration,
probably about 80% of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then there are 20% that don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm just wondering, I've heard a
lot of talk about neuropathic pain and
[SPEAKER_03]: pain syndromes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which products would I recommend to those
women?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the answer to the first question,
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we did our little stretch break,
I kind of covered the liver stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you stepped out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the synopsis is lean heavier on CBD,
which is anti-fibrotic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want a non-invasive way to
track liver fibrosis in response to an
[SPEAKER_05]: intervention, you can use the HEPA score
or even the FIB-4, F-I-B-4, which is a
[SPEAKER_05]: calculation based on a CBC and CMP that
accurately correlates with liver biopsy
[SPEAKER_05]: results in terms of fibrosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can track it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as far as neuropathic pain,
I mean, the best evidence that we have
[SPEAKER_05]: comes from the nebiximals trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: A one-to-one ratio is a pretty good place
to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that in cases where oral
mucosal dosing doesn't work, sometimes
[SPEAKER_05]: inhalation does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope there's a lot of doctors here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Carmel, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing consulting for seniors
since 2012 in their home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my question is this, or it's actually
a statement on how you all feel since
[SPEAKER_01]: seniors, a lot of them are deficient in
their endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wouldn't it seem right for them to
maybe start cannabis like we started now,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're not deficient in our
endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a question, because the more I'm
learning, you just want to take it to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it prophylactic, perhaps?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my other quick question with
seniors, because they're not making
[SPEAKER_01]: tinctures with alcohol, it burned them to
do the sublingual starting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that there's more oils,
the coconut oil and olive oils,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, how are they absorbed
sublingually?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they as well absorbed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take the first question.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do the second?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first question that you asked about
preventive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't really have studies but when
you see all the literature, I agree with
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was something I came across when I
was doing the literature review where one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the researchers who looks at
neurodegenerative illness wrote in his
[SPEAKER_04]: article, I've been looking for something
to help prevent neurodegenerative diseases
[SPEAKER_04]: and the only thing I've come across is
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the answer to that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you bring up a really good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it comes back to context,
physiological context.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want to lay a really strong
foundation, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that we tend to
forget, I think, in the cannabis field is
[SPEAKER_06]: that endocannabinoids are made out of
fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the quality of your diet is going
to have a very significant impact on your
[SPEAKER_06]: endogenous endocannabinoids, how much
endocannabinoid you've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not just 2 AG and anondamide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, they're made out of arachidonic acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the 80s and the 90s, people were
showing flow charts that showed that
[SPEAKER_06]: arachidonic acid went to PGE2,
which, of course, is inflammatory,
[SPEAKER_06]: except in the gut where it's protective.
[SPEAKER_06]: So nature paths were telling people that
they shouldn't eat chicken because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the richest meats in arachidonic
acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, OK, that's all well and good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember, any compound in the body
usually is a double-edged sword.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got two directions it can go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or multiple directions, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in this case, arachidonic acid is
actually beneficial as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's arachidonic acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's the oleic acid,
the allele derivatives that are
[SPEAKER_06]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even DHA and EPA potentially have got
some sort of endocannabinoid effect on
[SPEAKER_06]: tone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we're eating well, and so remember
this, if you're endocannabinoid deficient,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not about taking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about lithium.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's eat well, play, upregulate our
physiological system by playing and having
[SPEAKER_06]: a euphoric experience and not just
cannabis-induced, but life-induced.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those things in themselves will make a
huge difference in terms of the baseline
[SPEAKER_06]: of the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, certainly, if we need cannabis or
some other compound, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't think that there's much
pharmacokinetic data on the sublingual
[SPEAKER_05]: absorption of oil, except for what I
showed you, that Italian study.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it varies widely based on the
terpene content in that oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some that you can absolutely feel
in a minute or less after that hitting
[SPEAKER_05]: your oral mucosa, and some that it might
take a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And terpenes are known permeation
enhancers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, thank you all three for a very
informative day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Ryan Zach and I'm a physician in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, I'd love to hear your experience with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you answer patients that come in
asking about RSO?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you have a strategy with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: For my patients, I try not to take their
hope away, but I try to suggest multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: strains and several dots or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to hear your take on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've had any experience with
success, because the original story is
[SPEAKER_02]: based on a basal cell, which never made
any sense to me in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other one is topicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you had any experience with systemic
success with patients that use topical
[SPEAKER_02]: preparations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it mostly from localized areas?
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned trigger points, eczema,
or skin conditions, or more local
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to answer the cancer question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we see a wide variety of presentations
and requests, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to use cannabis exclusively.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to use it in combination with
conventional treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of one major fork in the road.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I look at people that are wanting
to use it exclusively, I very often find a
[SPEAKER_05]: patient that is unaware of their prognosis
and the treatment course, what that would
[SPEAKER_05]: look like if they went through
conventional treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of death anxiety in that
patient population.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my first target, actually,
is addressing the death anxiety and
[SPEAKER_05]: getting better information so that we can
then make a real decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that, I lean with the low dose
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I paint the picture of, well,
we're going to introduce you to this,
[SPEAKER_05]: get you feeling really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe follow some cancer markers.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's non-invasive markers and things
that don't require an expensive scan,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of people aren't aware of things
like neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio is
[SPEAKER_05]: very easy to follow, HSCRP, ESR.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of markers that can tell you
what direction the cancer is going,
[SPEAKER_05]: monocyte levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I usually follow that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have the real conversation at
the first follow-up visit, which is,
[SPEAKER_05]: are we going to shift gears here into the
super high-dose approach, which I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: really have a lot of evidence will help
you?
[SPEAKER_05]: In my clinical experience, I have cases
that have absolutely responded to cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: monotherapy at low and moderate doses.
[SPEAKER_05]: One that I'm following right now,
testicular cancer that produces HCG,
[SPEAKER_05]: so it's very easy to follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And no other treatment in the history of
this case beyond cannabis, about 40
[SPEAKER_05]: milligrams total daily.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those levels are down, and the
patient's doing fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So while most of the anecdotes you hear
about are related to these 500 to 2,000
[SPEAKER_05]: milligram doses as far as the response,
I don't think that's always required.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the vast majority of my cases that
we've seen do great are those that combine
[SPEAKER_05]: everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: They use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: They intelligently choose what fits for
them personally best from conventional
[SPEAKER_05]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: They paint the picture of, hey,
I'm sitting in the infusion room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone else is turning green and looking
sick, and I'm feeling great.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's usually what I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think so many people just don't know
what they're dealing with and come in with
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to leave the topical to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just going to comment on the
cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, because I take care of children,
if they're in my office and they have
[SPEAKER_04]: cancer, it's usually because they are at
the end of the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You as an adult have a right to choose
your treatment, but pediatric patients do
[SPEAKER_04]: not.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you choose not to have your child
treated, with chemo and they have cancer,
[SPEAKER_04]: they will take your child away from you
and subject them to the chemo and
[SPEAKER_04]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have had a number of patients who came
to me with end stage, stage four.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no stage five, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Metastatic cancers where we have actually
achieved remission.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a Wilms tumor patient who had a
kidney removed, and then she three months
[SPEAKER_04]: later relapsed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pulmonary relapsed, and we have her.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's now like, I don't know, almost five
years out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was with high dose cannabinoids
added to chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was on, I think, nine out of 28
planned chemos.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was already cancer free, so they
decided to discontinue the rest of the
[SPEAKER_04]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's done very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: She has continued on cannabinoid
treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her mom says she's going to be on it for
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we usually recommend that you should
not stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a case, Dr. Jeffrey Hergenrather,
who's a cannabis physician in Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: California, had a patient who was nine and
a half years free from glioblastoma
[SPEAKER_04]: multiforme and stopped using cannabis,
and he relapsed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So remember, it's not just, you can't see
the little stem cells, the cancer stem
[SPEAKER_04]: cells that are floating around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one case of a stage four,
a boy with stage four osteosarcoma who had
[SPEAKER_04]: over 20 or 30 tumors in his chest who
became cancer free on very high doses of
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a Hail Mary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just share that with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Combination with chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_04]: We added in high dose CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I say high dose, 500 milligrams of
each.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in 2015.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is still alive and cancer free now.
[SPEAKER_02]: 500 milligrams daily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Daily, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the 500 milligrams divided in TID.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about 165 milligrams of each.
[SPEAKER_04]: THC, two separate products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did take it in the RSO formulation
sublingually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he came to me at 16, wasn't supposed
to make it to 17, and he just turned 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a great report.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we don't get that with everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was on gemcitabine and Taxotere.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a report in the literature of
mice with pancreatic cell xenografts that
[SPEAKER_04]: when they take gemcitabine and
cannabinoids, there's a synergistic
[SPEAKER_04]: effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for him, I wanted to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But by the way, I'll just share with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a young lady come in 14 years old
with stage four osteosarcoma with visible
[SPEAKER_04]: tumors coming out of her legs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And her father misheard my dosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I said 500 per day, he thought I
said 500 per dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will tell you already, everything is
shrinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been maybe eight weeks now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when they emailed me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she had a lung tumor that was
inoperable.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was 12 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's down to eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: The two leg large tumors are no longer
lighting up on the nuclear scans.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she came off oxygen, off opiates,
got up and started walking around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are sometimes cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is somebody's child that's in my
office.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last thing that I'm going to do is
harm them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But cannabis in high doses is not going to
harm a child.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can always stop it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I figure, especially because so many
cases come in so late, why wouldn't you
[SPEAKER_04]: try?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll throw in a little on the cancer
side, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the first gigs I had in the
cannabis industry was helping a company
[SPEAKER_06]: scale up who basically did a lot of cancer
treatments.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were rather inflexible in their
protocol.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were using about a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was great to hear Dustin here say,
and Bonnie, that you don't need
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're using a gram a day to treat
cancer, you've got to know that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be wiped out.
[SPEAKER_06]: A Cox inhibitor, by the way, will help
with some of the side effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're going to need somebody to take
care of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I saw people have remarkable recoveries
in 12 to 24 weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also saw people die.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this company insisted that they
couldn't use anything else, any other
[SPEAKER_06]: drugs, which is not an intelligent way to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the topical question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Topicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen any systemic benefits from
topicals other than localized?
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a physician on the East Coast
named Dr. Deborah Kimliss who has actually
[SPEAKER_06]: got some interesting case studies on using
topicals for cancer, which makes you think
[SPEAKER_06]: about dosing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because certainly, if the effects of the
topicals are to reduce the cancer,
[SPEAKER_06]: if it's a direct effect, then that's a
pretty low dose.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just can't absorb that much
cannabinoid through your skin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's definitely interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that should be checked out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know a case, actually in my land in
southern Oregon, where a guy was using
[SPEAKER_06]: really tiny doses of THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was under 20 milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it had stopped a liver cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was four years into his treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had been a stage four.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's lots of anecdotal stuff out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some direct clinical experience
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's definitely something to think
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think topical.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out Deborah Kimliss.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she's got a website.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: She's in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think she's got a topical company
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one last thing is the report that I
talked about from GW Pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_04]: where they combined Timodar with CBD and
THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are not high doses.
[SPEAKER_04]: They used low doses in that report.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to ask about applications
of cannabis for acute pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, of course, it seems to suit well
for chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with acute pain, my understanding is
that it can magnify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you speak to what kind of protocol and
dosage you may suggest for acute pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it is at all a good match for that?
[SPEAKER_05]: So topical cannabis is an excellent first
aid remedy for acute pain, even in the
[SPEAKER_05]: naive user.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great on bee stings and other
things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This really needs to be framed in some
ways as a first aid kind of a home remedy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But systemic use in a naive user THC can
absolutely exacerbate acute pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Less likely to do so in someone that is an
experienced THC user.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think there's much data on CBD
for acute pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't seen it used that way very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Derek Johnson, physician from Park City,
Utah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all for sharing your knowledge
with us today.
[SPEAKER_08]: We touched briefly on perinatal exposure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And based on the current literature,
I'm just curious as to how you all are
[SPEAKER_08]: accounting your patients who are either
pregnant and using or new moms who are
[SPEAKER_08]: either using or interested in using?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So number one is really document this
clearly and copy the OB team with your
[SPEAKER_05]: chart notes and a letter and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way I think about it is in a
couple different categories.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's the women that are doing really
well using cannabis to treat a chronic
[SPEAKER_05]: condition that then become pregnant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in that situation, we have to weigh
the risk and benefits of removing this
[SPEAKER_05]: current treatment, what the alternatives
might be, and what their risk is for mom
[SPEAKER_05]: and baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think these categories have kind of
been done away with.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we might consider cannabis like a
category C medication or maybe somewhere
[SPEAKER_05]: in between B and a C when it comes to
pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one example we could talk about,
which is probably the two most common,
[SPEAKER_05]: would be chronic pain and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if a mom is doing really well treating
her chronic pain and PTSD, she becomes
[SPEAKER_05]: pregnant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we want to remove the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are our other options?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about NSAIDs and Tylenol?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not great for pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about opioids in pregnancy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neonatal abstinence syndrome, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis does not cause NAS.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's look at PTSD.
[SPEAKER_05]: More mild treatment might be SSRIs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those do cause neonatal abstinence
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're not very effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then what are we left with?
[SPEAKER_05]: The benzodiazepines and other anxiolytics?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the risk benefit ratio favors the
cannabis over the benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how you kind of work it in the
assessment and really spell it out that
[SPEAKER_05]: there's already a level of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're going to do is make sure
that there's no combustion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So mom's not inhaling smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're using the lowest effective dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're avoiding tolerance building,
which means we're avoiding causing a
[SPEAKER_05]: dysregulation of the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to follow this mom and
monitor her and then be extraordinarily
[SPEAKER_05]: vigilant when it comes to the perinatal
period, because you do not want an
[SPEAKER_05]: interruption of bonding and initiation of
breastfeeding, which will happen when
[SPEAKER_05]: child protective services gets involved
because some nurse is concerned about THC
[SPEAKER_05]: in the urine drug screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So very vigilant around that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure it's in the birth plan that THC
is not going to be tested for in the
[SPEAKER_05]: urine, because the results are clinically
irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just do not test.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it requires a lot of work and
communication, but you can do it
[SPEAKER_05]: successfully.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then the other case is someone with
morning sickness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And no, we're not going to just say,
oh, you've got mild morning sickness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you try cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more like, why don't you try ginger
and try changing your diet?
[SPEAKER_05]: But when it's hyperemesis gravidarum
that's refractory to anti-medics and we're
[SPEAKER_05]: considering a PICC line, which is the more
favorable risk benefit ratio, cannabis or
[SPEAKER_05]: the PICC line?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not rocket science,
but it requires a lot of work and advocacy
[SPEAKER_05]: and education.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to share with you,
I had to take care of a woman who had
[SPEAKER_04]: bipolar.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been my patient for probably 10
years, and she came in pregnant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said to me, I'm terrified of
talking to my OB about using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually called the OB right there
and then during the appointment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the OB was actually quite lovely about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they said was that now that they
know what they're going to do is counsel
[SPEAKER_04]: her.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they felt that it was important to
tell her that they would prefer that she
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't use this, but that they were not
going to drug test her at the time that
[SPEAKER_04]: the baby was delivered because we had made
this phone call and because it was now
[SPEAKER_04]: documented and because there was a reason
for her to be using medical reason and she
[SPEAKER_04]: was medically approved.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't the same as someone who was not
a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that was very helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: The communication is huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're out of questions and
right on time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all for staying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for sticking around for the
whole day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before you get up and leave, I want to
make sure everyone's had a chance to sign.
[SPEAKER_05]: Has anyone not signed in for the CME?
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like I haven't actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that clipboard is still here,
we need to sign it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And any other housekeeping things,
Doug?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, we've got dinner here in an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: So grab your stuff and get some fresh air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
