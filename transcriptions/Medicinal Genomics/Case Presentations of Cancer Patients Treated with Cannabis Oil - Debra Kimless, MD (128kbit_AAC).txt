[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning, everyone, and thank you to
the McKernans for providing such an
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible platform to share amazing
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been an incredible event so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my name is Deb Kimlis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an anesthesiologist and pain medicine
specialist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also the medical director of Forward
Grow, which is a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation company in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were awarded a stage one license to
cultivate cannabis in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're busy doing our buildout so that
we can be inspected and create medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: for the patients in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my passion and my love and what I do
and I think what I live for is that I am
[SPEAKER_03]: currently treating over 100 patients pro
bono.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'm medically guiding them in
concert with their treating physicians
[SPEAKER_03]: using medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I do this, we define benchmarks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We define goals because everybody's goals
and everybody's benchmarks are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that information and I share it in
conferences such as this, medical grand
[SPEAKER_03]: rounds, healthcare professionals,
patients, and pretty much anybody that
[SPEAKER_03]: will listen to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for listening to me today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we're going to discuss four cancer
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each of them different, but each of
them have some things that are similar in
[SPEAKER_03]: addition to having cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The desperate desire for hope is that they
were all treated with a very low dose
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis oil extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people call it a microdose and I'm
going to talk about what that definition
[SPEAKER_03]: means.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the circles of, in the context of
microdose in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't different than in science
industry mean 10 to the minus six.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means a very low dose because medical
cannabis I think comes from the
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational or adult use size where
people are using very high doses or
[SPEAKER_03]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to do a little bit of
math here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we take a joint, which I hate that
term, and if it weighs about a gram or a
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand milligrams and 20% of it is THC,
you end up having about 200 milligrams in
[SPEAKER_03]: that dosage form.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 30 to 40% of it, it goes up in smoke
literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they consume the entire dosage,
it ends up being about 60.
[SPEAKER_03]: 60 to 80 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: The low dose or microdose cannabis that
these patients all took was literally less
[SPEAKER_03]: than one, less than two milligrams per ML.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll go into it a little bit more
specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is their dosage form.
[SPEAKER_03]: In one ML, half of it is in the acid form
or the raw form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half of it is in the decarboxylated or
neutral form.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a 10 to one ratio of the THC or THC
to CBD to CBDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also has the minor cannabinoids and
some terpenes in it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they take varied amount of doses
depending upon what the condition is to
[SPEAKER_03]: treat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a rationale behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ligresti et al.
[SPEAKER_03]: in 2006 published this chart, which was
very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it shows the micromoles of THC,
of all the cannabinoids in its acid and
[SPEAKER_03]: neutral forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it does to the IC50, which is the
inhibitory concentration where 50% of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer cells don't grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does that mean in English?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I had no idea what a micromole
means in life is that if you use
[SPEAKER_03]: Avogadro's equation, and I was absent that
day, so I actually used the help of a
[SPEAKER_03]: friend, to convert micromoles to
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even at its highest dose of THC,
it ends up being 12.5 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I think we can all agree is a lot
less.
[SPEAKER_03]: Than the 60 to 80 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the thought is, and what we
probably heard over the last day and a
[SPEAKER_03]: half so far, is that we want to keep the
med in medicine, the minimal effective
[SPEAKER_03]: dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always titrate higher,
but we want to see what we can do with the
[SPEAKER_03]: least amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to talk about two cases of
patients with prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first is a gentleman, 72 years old,
who came to me with recurrent prostate
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was diagnosed in 2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a Gleason score.
[SPEAKER_03]: A score of eight, clinical state of T2B,
and a PSA of 7.2.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was successfully treated with hormone
deprivation with Lupron injection,
[SPEAKER_03]: seed implant, and radiation therapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his PSA dropped to .3.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was doing great for about four years,
and then his PSA started to rise again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they monitored him over 10 months,
and in August, his PSA level was 7.8,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's where he came to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ends up did his CAT scans, thankfully,
and bone scans were negative for
[SPEAKER_03]: metastasis, and he wanted to do some help,
get some help.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when he first saw me, he began the
first of his three Lupron injections.
[SPEAKER_03]: His PSA, after a month, was still 7.8.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started a program of low-dose cannabis
oil, one milligram, sublingually,
[SPEAKER_03]: four times a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We changed his diet, and then he continued
this regimen for the second and third
[SPEAKER_03]: Lupride injections.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just want to show you a chart
that shows, on this level is PSA level.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our benchmark, and this is time
in months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is his first month after his
recurrence, where he got a Lupron
[SPEAKER_03]: injection alone, and his PSA was 7.2,
or 7.8, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second month, when he came to me,
we continued his Lupron and gave him the
[SPEAKER_03]: microdose of cannabis oil, sublingually,
four times, and after that, a month,
[SPEAKER_03]: we redrew his PSA, and it ended up being
4.8.
[SPEAKER_03]: Third month, continued the same regimen
with the Lupron and the cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It dropped to .3.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fourth month, no more Lupron.
[SPEAKER_03]: They only get it three months in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stayed stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifth month, .2, and literally,
while I was standing in the back,
[SPEAKER_03]: getting ready to give this presentation,
I just got a text from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got back from Italy with his wife,
and his PSA remains consistent at .2.
[SPEAKER_03]: 81-year-old man, who was otherwise
healthy, was diagnosed with, had some back
[SPEAKER_03]: pain issues, workup revealed, a metastatic
prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was treated with seed implants,
radiation therapy, and the Lupron
[SPEAKER_03]: injections, and his markers were
escalating testosterone levels,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they wanted to do surgery to remove
his testicles to try to ablate the rising
[SPEAKER_03]: testosterone that was fueling the cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he came to me with the hope that
perhaps he could avoid surgery.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Testosterone is our marker here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was as high as 13.50, and over the
weeks, we started at week zero to week
[SPEAKER_03]: two.
[SPEAKER_03]: In two weeks, one ML, five times a day,
sublingually, it dropped 500 points from
[SPEAKER_03]: 13.50 to 8.50.
[SPEAKER_03]: His surgeon said, that's great,
we still think we need to have surgery,
[SPEAKER_03]: because give me two more weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: In two weeks, his testosterone level
dropped below like what would be even seen
[SPEAKER_03]: in a normal level, and it continues as
such to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are studies that show that this
is not a surprising result for these
[SPEAKER_03]: prostate cancer patients, including a
study that shows the androgen-reducing
[SPEAKER_03]: effects of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So brain cancer too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have an eight-year-old girl with
acute lymphocytic leukemia.
[SPEAKER_03]: She failed multiple chemotherapy trials
and multiple radiation trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had a bone marrow transplant that
lasted about a year and then no longer was
[SPEAKER_03]: successful, and she was placed in hospice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And her mom and dad came to us wanting
some hope to see if we can help her out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chief complains for the little girl's
chronic nausea, lack of appetite,
[SPEAKER_03]: severe headache, and lack of energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And upon evaluation when we saw her,
she was very somnolent, non-communicative,
[SPEAKER_03]: and her face was swollen, her eyes were
swollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because she was on hospice,
the medicines that she was being treated
[SPEAKER_03]: with was methadone and morphine on divided
doses,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked about goals, and the goals
for her was that we hoped that we would
[SPEAKER_03]: reduce her opiates so that she can start
eating and actually live out her last days
[SPEAKER_03]: in life, being an active participant in
her world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is her MRI in February 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a leptomeningo spread of her
cancer, including her ventricles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so improved quality of life,
trying to help her with her pain,
[SPEAKER_03]: and transition off of opiates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we treated her with one ml of the
cannabis oil extract four times a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, this stuff tastes like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not flavored, it's not treated,
it has no sugar component, it tastes
[SPEAKER_03]: awful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this little girl of eight years old
sat and watched her cartoons with this
[SPEAKER_03]: under her tongue without a complaint,
which I found incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the initial response was that they
started to slowly reduce her narcotics and
[SPEAKER_03]: then replaced it completely, and so she
was off of all of her opiates.
[SPEAKER_03]: She became more active, and she had the
appropriate demeanor of an eight year old.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for any of you who are parents out
there, you would recognize this as back
[SPEAKER_03]: talking, not listening, refusing to take a
bath, and I think eye rolling was
[SPEAKER_03]: involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mom recognized that this was not
the normal behavior of an eight year old
[SPEAKER_03]: who is dying of cancer, and she,
even though they were on hospice,
[SPEAKER_03]: insisted on another MRI.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's still some cancer leptomeningo
spread here, but you can see the
[SPEAKER_03]: ventricles are cleared and everything else
was cleared.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a comparison.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this is no surprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are studies that show ALL and ABUCA
leukemias being treated with cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: of all sorts, either CBD, THC,
or in conjunction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, this last case is a case
study, seeing it out, that described a
[SPEAKER_03]: case very similar to the one that I just
described, who was put in hospice,
[SPEAKER_03]: was treated with a whole plant extract of
cannabinoids sublingually.
[SPEAKER_03]: She went into remission, and
unfortunately, in this particular patient,
[SPEAKER_03]: she died of a perforated bowel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for our case, she's still alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So history, here's an otherwise healthy 69
year old man who presented to the
[SPEAKER_03]: emergency room post-ictal.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a grand mal seizure, and he woke up
in the ER not knowing what was going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had an MRI that revealed a tumor,
a biopsy diagnosed with a glioblastoma,
[SPEAKER_03]: his chief complaints were lethargy,
inability to perform his activities,
[SPEAKER_03]: a daily living without assistance,
and he was a big guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was six foot four, and his wife was a
small lady, and she was really struggling
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to just get him dressed in the
morning and feeding him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had cognitive changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a guy that prior to the surgery was
active.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was an insurance salesman.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was on the computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He rode his bike and interacted with his
kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only medicine that he was taking was
the Tegretol for seizures, and that was
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's his tumor, and it's in a really
bad area.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically in the corpus callosum,
in the center of his head, so it was
[SPEAKER_03]: inoperable.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a biopsy, and the one drug that
was supposed to help with glioblastoma is
[SPEAKER_03]: Timidor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was tested not to be good for him,
so he was supposed to see his oncologist
[SPEAKER_03]: and get set up for radiation therapy,
but somehow he saw me first, and we
[SPEAKER_03]: started him on a low-dose cannabis oil,
four times a day, sublingually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, he complained.
[SPEAKER_03]: He hated this stuff and didn't want to do
it, but his wife literally wrestled him
[SPEAKER_03]: down and made him do it, and did the Mary
Poppins a spoonful of sugar after it was
[SPEAKER_03]: done, so when he was done, he got a mint,
and he was happy with that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the goals were to improve the
quality of his life, improve his function,
[SPEAKER_03]: and with the hope, because there's lots of
stuff out there that says that it can help
[SPEAKER_03]: with glioblastomas.
[SPEAKER_03]: His wife desperately wanted to reduce the
tumor growth, and in the first two days,
[SPEAKER_03]: he started feeding himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the week, he was on a
computer, and somehow, and I didn't order
[SPEAKER_03]: it, somebody ordered an MRI two weeks
later, and if anybody knows how difficult
[SPEAKER_03]: it is to get approval for any MRI,
I have no idea how this happened,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the radiology report said evidence of
central cystic degeneration, clearly
[SPEAKER_03]: responding to radiation, but there was no
radiation at all given, and here's a
[SPEAKER_03]: side-by-side response.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, he did go for radiation therapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did treat him with Timidor,
even though it was not indicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they, and far be it for me to make
these judgments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I had this in my head,
too, or my loved one, I think I would
[SPEAKER_03]: throw everything at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was treated, his last treatment was in
September, and I'll show you what he looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, there are studies that show
that these things work, and so this was
[SPEAKER_03]: last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first of it, but it didn't
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not saying that we're curing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying that we're managing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just rode a bicycle with his wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are celebrating an anniversary,
I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They went to some spa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're living a better life,
quality life than maybe many of us,
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, and this is our greenhouse that
we're building out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one acre under glass, and I beat the
clock, so if anybody has questions,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be more than happy to answer them
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a proprietary extract of five
different strains that they want to
[SPEAKER_03]: combine, so they get as many of the
terpenes in major and minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ends up being naturally a 10 to one
ratio of THC to CBD, THC to A to CBDA per
[SPEAKER_03]: mL.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people get four mL today,
some people get, it depends on what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: treating and how aggressive and what they
look like with their experiences,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we titrate it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's sort of the ultimate goal,
because even though with this ratio,
[SPEAKER_03]: the majority of people don't feel any
psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I treat patients, eight was the youngest,
to 92.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the 92 year old say it just gives them
a sense of relaxation, helps them sleep,
[SPEAKER_03]: but no psychoactivity in the high sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the terpenoid profile?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's ever tested it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff is out of California,
so I'm lucky that we have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one more question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In patients that have had metastatic
disease, are you seeing any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: metastatic tumors shrinking as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the patients with metastatic
disease, I see them managed, meaning that
[SPEAKER_03]: their pain is reduced, their tumors
haven't increased or spread, but I have
[SPEAKER_03]: not seen the mets disappear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Primary tumors, yes, but not the
metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that the reason low dose is
so effective is that it mimics the low
[SPEAKER_00]: dose of our endocannabinoids and it
doesn't affect our receptor, no
[SPEAKER_00]: downregulation, and that it keeps kind of
the receptors without changing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's certainly a possibility,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had the answer, I would hopefully be
getting a Nobel Prize somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, there's people here far more
smarter than I am, but I think that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, my thought is maybe it's helping
us balance ourselves, allowing our immune
[SPEAKER_03]: system to do what it's supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I change everybody's diet to give them the
maximum nutrition to provide a meal use so
[SPEAKER_03]: that the endocannabinoid system can work
as best as it can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Conventional knowledge tells us that the
cannabinoid acids don't cross the
[SPEAKER_02]: blood-brain barrier, but they do cross
blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: In pediatric patients, they clear cut that
it does because it stops seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this an indication that, again,
cannabinoid acids are actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, or should I say the cannabinoid
acids can essentially be active and not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily the deactivated form,
and they have to be activated by
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylation?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I never understood the term activated
or deactivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think cannabinoids and terpenes are all
important in the chemistry of this plant
[SPEAKER_03]: and the healthful benefits that it can
offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when people use the terms
activated, I think it means to allow it to
[SPEAKER_03]: become psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm wondering, and I'll posit this
question to everybody out here,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, is that what everybody's talking
about?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's trying to achieve a psychoactivity,
but I still think that the acids provide a
[SPEAKER_03]: healthful benefit to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen it in over 100 patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a really great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we follow benchmarks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the patient who's been nine months
with a PSA now, still back down to .2,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to start to slowly reduce him
because I know that his benchmark is easy
[SPEAKER_03]: to follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the eight-year-old girl that is now
10, we're keeping her on a steady-state
[SPEAKER_03]: dose because I don't know any better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, she seems to be thriving
that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, these are just the easy ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have lung cancer patients, ovarian
cancer patients, breast cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they follow the plan and they listen
and, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask one more question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried higher dose to see if you
can eliminate tumor completely?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think somebody said if all you have
is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sadly, because we're limited in
opportunity for consistency and profiling,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is the only medicine that I have
access to consistently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the beauty is I treat my patients pro
bono.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get medicine free of charge as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so because of that, they're very open
to trying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it doesn't work, then I do make
recommendations to go higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then our hands are tied as to what it
is because especially in legal states
[SPEAKER_03]: where they're out west, where there's not
a lot of testing, it becomes very
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult to figure out what exactly
they're getting and making sure they get
[SPEAKER_03]: it continually.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would love to, and that's why I'm
the medical director in Maryland,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's my passion is to make sure
we have consistency, make sure we have
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities to scale up if we need
because everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody needs high doses and not
everyone works with low dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
