[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor, quite an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to speak loud enough that the mic
catches it as I'm a bit above it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to be that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kyle Turley, kid from Southern
California, son of a truck driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decided to play football one year in high
school and was that good at it that they
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to give me a scholarship to go to
college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no intention of doing so,
so that required me to spend the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: my senior year while everyone was on half
day making up all the classes that I
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to qualify for college and earn
this scholarship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along that way, had some amazing things
happen, some unbelievable things,
[SPEAKER_00]: met some amazing people, did some things
that very few people in the world have the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the same time, had some severe
consequences from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we're here, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to live this life, to take on
these challenges, to look at these
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains as only obstacles and accomplish
great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The many things that were talked about
earlier in this discussion today so far by
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Mishulam, who has been an unbelievable
asset to this discussion and conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: for many, many years, to have brought us
here today at Harvard.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an amazing opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again, Dr. Mishulam,
for your excellence and your perseverance.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most amazing parts in meeting
this man, to sit and talk with him and
[SPEAKER_00]: see, after so long, his continued
perseverance and persistence to tell this
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: For obvious reasons that we don't know,
that some people do know, they are intent
[SPEAKER_00]: on keeping this from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to have individuals like Dr. Mishulam
to tell that story when he could easily be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing so many other things with his life
is very inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I've had the opportunity to meet a
number of people in this world through my
[SPEAKER_00]: fame and playing in the National Football
League.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when people ask me those moments and
who did you meet and all these cool things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you got to do, this tops it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an unbelievable opportunity and an
honor for me to be present personally in
[SPEAKER_00]: this moment at this time in our existence
as humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, speaking about a medicine that
will save many people, that it's taken us
[SPEAKER_00]: this long to redirect ourselves because,
as we know, cannabis was not illegal in
[SPEAKER_00]: this country even until the 1970s when
they went on their tirade and rampage
[SPEAKER_00]: against it at the same time of the birth
of the pharmaceutical industry and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: why I'm here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes in life we have to examine and
contemplate what it is we're here to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason I have been put here
to be a part of this discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very emotional roller coaster to
be on and to be standing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standing here, again, a kid from San Diego
State University wasn't supposed to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it to college, wasn't supposed to make it
through college, wasn't supposed to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: first-round draft pick, drafted higher
than all the guys in the SEC at my
[SPEAKER_00]: position, this kid coming out of San Diego
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was always because I searched for
the answers within myself, within the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy that surrounds us as we understand
it and many of the scientific minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: here understand that our energy force
resonates far outside of our physical
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tend to try to tap into that and
that ultimately brought me to where I am
[SPEAKER_00]: today and having the experience that I've
had with cannabis to tell my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came along from a 20-year addiction
to pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: medications because of trying to climb a
mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along that climb, having these amazing
experiences, I had the opportunity to have
[SPEAKER_00]: intimate knowledge of the pharmaceutical
industry and what it does for injury and
[SPEAKER_00]: illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can honestly say through prolonged
use of pharmaceuticals, these man-made
[SPEAKER_00]: concoctions that in all fairness have been
fully intended to help, I think we've
[SPEAKER_00]: realized the consequence of that in our
country as we see it daily playing out on
[SPEAKER_00]: our televisions with the devastation that
is not just plaguing our athlete
[SPEAKER_00]: community, but plaguing our respective
communities in our hometowns where we grew
[SPEAKER_00]: up, major metropolis cities, and not just
anymore the excuse of you're from the
[SPEAKER_00]: ghetto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has been a savior to me in that
at my lowest point in life of despair and
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of who I was because of the
inherencies in playing the sport of
[SPEAKER_00]: football, the damage done by the game,
but more importantly the damage done on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of that damage from these chemicals
I've been using for the past few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think that's one of the reasons why
I was putting into my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I had to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was sitting on my couch one day,
just returned from the Crosby Center down
[SPEAKER_00]: in San Diego where I was receiving some
care, going through therapy sessions for
[SPEAKER_00]: over seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to neurologists,
neuropsychologists, counselors,
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy groups to try and understand what
was happening to me as a young man when
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody says, you look amazing,
to know that inside I felt far from it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a very difficult thing to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the consequence of playing the
game of football.
[SPEAKER_00]: We obviously have severe damage to our
bodies when we get into car accidents or
[SPEAKER_00]: any other severe cases of trauma where our
bodies are injured.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do this on a repetitive basis,
day in, day out.
[SPEAKER_00]: An average practice will be 60 to 80 plays
and at certain positions that is 60 to 80
[SPEAKER_00]: collisions equivalent to a massive car
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the position I informedly
chose to play because of what this game
[SPEAKER_00]: has in store, which is why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here for athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started a campaign called Athletes Can
because I believe athletes can change this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it away from this singular notion of,
well, it could help these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have individuals that we expect to
achieve and accomplish great things in our
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It not only spans for athletes but through
our military, where these are not,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it is appearing, certain powers are
trying to position these choices for our
[SPEAKER_00]: children.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were not always ghetto choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were choices in the highest learning
institutions to achieve these high honors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing football at Harvard was no
different than playing football at any SEC
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your ultimate goal is to make it to the
National Football League.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have many good friends that attended
this school that have done so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have discussions about what is
going on in our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvard itself has a study right now that
is taking place with the National Football
[SPEAKER_00]: League and the Players Association to
analyze players' lives to hopefully help
[SPEAKER_00]: for future generations of playing this
sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defeat against all of these things that
are coming at us from every angle as it is
[SPEAKER_00]: in a football game.
[SPEAKER_00]: These efforts have come to an extent a
crossroads of how are we going to accept
[SPEAKER_00]: the inherencies in this sport and continue
to encourage our children to play these
[SPEAKER_00]: sports and encourage their dreams to
accomplish these amazing achievements when
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that inherently within these
sports lies nine to 10 times rate
[SPEAKER_00]: reception of Alzheimer's, dementia,
ALS, Parkinson's disease, and 10 to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: kids die every year in youth football.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a guarantee due to the lack of
attention given to certain injuries that
[SPEAKER_00]: are inherent in the sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot have, unfortunately with the
human body, injury not occur while putting
[SPEAKER_00]: it in precarious situations of collision.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these sports, these contact sports,
or as we're experiencing even into other
[SPEAKER_00]: sports, as we've experienced recently in
the extreme sports community, a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: BMX riders are starting to kill
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at it, myself, my friends,
my colleagues, and we try to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: how is this happening, why is this
happening, and we only need to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves, which is a very fortunate
position to be in, in that I can sit to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk and tell my story and it is something
that is very detailed to anyone even in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world of science because I understand
these things that are happening to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: the resolutions I've found in certain
medicines through trial and personal error
[SPEAKER_00]: of taking these medicines, and that is not
just in me and in my court.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a relative ability for my
teammates to speak to this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post football career, I went into music,
enjoyed playing music, I played guitar,
[SPEAKER_00]: and drums, and I sing, and so I went to
Nashville, of course, to try and climb
[SPEAKER_00]: another mountain, had the other
opportunity to tour the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: playing my music coast to coast,
and pretty much in every state for over
[SPEAKER_00]: four to five years, and had the
opportunity to play with some amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: artists around this great country,
and every opportunity I had to connect
[SPEAKER_00]: with the next teammate, I did so,
and across the board, every one of us is
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering in ways that people wouldn't
believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to, I know, understand this
because you're sitting there looking at me
[SPEAKER_00]: like, ah, this guy's got it together,
and he's been able to speak about this and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about this, articulate this,
and the only reason I'm here today and
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to do this is because of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through my trial and error in taking
medicine, I realized that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things that I have in injury that
medicine is good for as far as common
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, Western medicine, but in the
long-term use of being addicted to these
[SPEAKER_00]: medications since 1996 until exactly a
year ago this month when I decided at a
[SPEAKER_00]: position of desperation to take a chance
because my daily living was my hands
[SPEAKER_00]: shaking so severe I couldn't stop it to
where I had suicidal thoughts constantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: homicidal thoughts constantly,
rage to no end, and it was ruining my
[SPEAKER_00]: life, my family's life, and everyone
around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew there had to be something better,
there must be something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew along the way of using cannabis for
the first time when I was in my second
[SPEAKER_00]: year in the National Football League
because I was always concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: passing drug tests and not ever having
that be associated with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I saw many of my friends being
suspended, lose scholarships in college
[SPEAKER_00]: because of their use of cannabis,
I refrained, and then in my second year in
[SPEAKER_00]: the National Football League was going
through some very trying times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a teammate after practice one day
suggest it to me as I was losing sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't sleep, a lot of pressure in the
National Football League, a young player
[SPEAKER_00]: going through trying to create a normal
life with a wife and trying to start a
[SPEAKER_00]: family, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very frustrated, very, very stressful to
try and coordinate all those things and
[SPEAKER_00]: make all those things happen without
having a lot of confusion, disruption for
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone, and then on top of that trying to
associate all these things to being normal
[SPEAKER_00]: in a very unnormal world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transition from going from the real
world to an NFL practice facility to an
[SPEAKER_00]: NFL game day is you have to have the
switch, and you need to have to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it on and turn it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the off switch was
neglected many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that through what we
understand now about the brain has created
[SPEAKER_00]: the disruption that we have in our
community that is causing suicide at an
[SPEAKER_00]: unprecedented rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can no longer stand for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can no longer allow a medicine that has
been proven to protect our brains to be
[SPEAKER_00]: kept from us any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that you heard from Dr.
Mishulam and McKernan are unbelievable in
[SPEAKER_00]: their science, but more unbelievable in
the neglect of this information that has
[SPEAKER_00]: gone on for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we change this conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our veteran community is crying for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that spans across our military and all
of our veterans of these great
[SPEAKER_00]: achievements and mountains that we expect
our children to continue to climb that
[SPEAKER_00]: have consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important for us to understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things, you don't just wake up one
day and become a professional football
[SPEAKER_00]: player or an elite force military service
member.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are incredible accomplishments that
come with incredible cost, and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: imperative if we want to continue to raise
our children in this great country and
[SPEAKER_00]: expect them to achieve these amazing
accomplishments that we find a medicine to
[SPEAKER_00]: help it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no doubt about it that cannabis
can be that medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has saved my life personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: One year ago today, I was a very different
person and could not stand here in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of these lights with this pressure to
speak, to be around these amazing people
[SPEAKER_00]: and stand here and tell my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that my story can add to
this conversation as I speak for athletes
[SPEAKER_00]: across our world who at young ages are
being stricken to severe addictive drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: like OxyContin and Vicodin and Percocet
and Loratab and Darvacet and Tordol and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else that I can go on with all
the slides and everything that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: given these things do not help recover
injury, especially neurocognitive injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: No person in my opinion with a brain
injury should ever be given anything but
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as cannabis has saved my life
period but has proven to me to resolve
[SPEAKER_00]: neurocognitive issues that psych meds like
Wellbutrin, Depakote and Zoloft,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I was on for six years, were only
merely trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the opportunity to be here
but I more importantly urge you to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue this conversation outside of this
room, outside of these hallways and take
[SPEAKER_00]: this conversation to the mainstream as
that's where it has to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: These studies and all these things to many
people are only going to occur with full
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of cannabis and that has to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no possible way for us to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't defeat the big machine with this
medicine unless we have full legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is at your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is at my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I implore every one of you, vote for
cannabis every chance you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote to legalize, vote for medical
cannabis wherever it is at on a ballot and
[SPEAKER_00]: change this world because cannabis will.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about that and athletes
can save this conversation of suicide as
[SPEAKER_00]: we add our stories If you're an athlete,
even just a weekend Joe, please visit
[SPEAKER_00]: athletescan.org start to add your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started one organization, the Gridiron
Cannabis Coalition and it became a
[SPEAKER_00]: football issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a much bigger issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're a weekend Joe that likes to
go out and ride your mountain bike,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you fall, you're going to have an
injury and when you go to talk to your
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor, they're going to give you a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to give it to you freely and
willingly in large doses and those
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines unfortunately are not going to
look like that which is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: grows from the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to explore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to research and develop this as a
medicine but we need to immediately allow
[SPEAKER_00]: access as we understand the incredible
fight that is against this information
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate being here.
Thank you.
