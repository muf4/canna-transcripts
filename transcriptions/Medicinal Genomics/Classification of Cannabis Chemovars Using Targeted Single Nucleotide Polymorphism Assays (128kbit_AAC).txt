[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for being here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for John for his talk, which is
very enlightening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to following up with
some details on some of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been up to in British Columbia,
as well as with my colleagues Cindy Orser
[SPEAKER_00]: and Aaron Hilliard from Digipath Labs in
Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, you'll notice that there's
going to be a lot of parallels there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you've seen these illustrations
of the plant morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to refer to cannabis as
essentially a single species with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know, and what we've talked
about a lot today, is the fact that the
[SPEAKER_00]: influence of cannabis on humans and vice
versa has been nearly disproportioned in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature, in the sense that what you can see
here on this current map is what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: say is the origin of different
morphologies of cannabis without referring
[SPEAKER_00]: to anything more than just the morphology
and the size of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see a narrow leaf hemp,
NOH, kind of in Europe there, the broad
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf drug type, and the narrow leaf drug
type, which those would be the indica
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa of the recreational or the medical
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the broad leaf hemp, which is
more thought of as being the Chinese hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, these would be the kind of
a primer of where the plants emerged and
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, as we know, it's moved
around the world and there's hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: between most likely all of those gene
pools at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broad leaf and narrow leaf hemp have
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, I think when we refer to
drug type cannabis these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really referring to a large hybrid
gene pool of both broad leaf drug type and
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow leaf drug type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So organica, and kind of South Asia origin
with some of the auto flowering traits and
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly specifically auto flowering
traits originating from northern
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically European hemp that was
introgressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in essence, what we see is that we
have a natural process of moving a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world, and then we have the
impact of artificial selection like humans
[SPEAKER_00]: have had on any other crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a paper from Ernie Smoot,
who essentially illustrates what this
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have on the one side the fiber
cultivars, and then we have more the
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotic cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the concept here is that there was
divergent selection, selective pressures
[SPEAKER_00]: by the people that were essentially
collected these plants and then selected
[SPEAKER_00]: them for very different reasons,
whether let's say broad categories of drug
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars versus hemp cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This relates to, this is the same paper or
another paper by Ernie Smoot as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this relates to the question everybody
asks, hey, let's get, is it good to do
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity cannabinoids from hemp grown
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are we better off focusing on growing
indoor in a controlled environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: a drug type cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what you see here and what
this table shows is that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference in between the size
of trichomes in drug type cannabis versus
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber type cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp versus marijuana, there is here
essentially almost a 1.6 time larger size
[SPEAKER_00]: of trichomes in drug type cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially you can see that this plant
was purpose bred for resin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially having larger trichomes,
maybe more numerous trichomes is also one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the key features there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially for me, at this point in
time, I think that's the large difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between hemp and cannabis is really the,
that's why we cap that 5% when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking hemp that hasn't been intergressed
with that key trait of resin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna go over the solid paper
because obviously it was just covered,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I did do here is essentially
delve a little bit deeper into that
[SPEAKER_00]: concept of the divergence between these
two gene pools, in particular European
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and drug type cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is work done recently,
published at the end of 2017 by a group
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did my undergrad thesis and my
master's thesis at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Lausanne in Switzerland, where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially my master's advisor,
Jérôme Goudet, and one of my committee
[SPEAKER_00]: members were the lead investigators on
this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interesting part about this study
is that they use the type of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: markers called single sequence repeat or
microsatellites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interesting part with those is
that those markers are typically thought
[SPEAKER_00]: to not be under the effect of selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're typically thought of being
neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means that it's basically immune to
the effect of people moving stuff around
[SPEAKER_00]: and essentially more so breeding for
specific purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So neutral areas of the genome,
they don't code for genes, but they might
[SPEAKER_00]: be associated with genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it makes more sense to use
neutral markers when we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: decipher the evolutionary history of a
particular structure that we're observing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case here, we do see,
as you can see here from the green plot on
[SPEAKER_00]: the right there, every single one of these
bars is an individual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 1,234 plants sampled here out
of 48 populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is probably the first
population level study on cannabis sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have thousands of individuals and
dozens of populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially red and green separates
these two gene pools between hemp and drug
[SPEAKER_00]: type cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see that there is essentially
a clear pattern of structure, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not much more that we can see from this
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thankfully to these authors,
they essentially shared their data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I downloaded the data from the PLOS ONE
website and repeated those analyses and
[SPEAKER_00]: added some essentially labels to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also going beyond that, seeing a
particular structure where we have on the
[SPEAKER_00]: top right essentially the monoaceous
varieties of European hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we go from the blue colored to the
yellow colored, we're now going towards
[SPEAKER_00]: dioecious hamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially monoaceous hamp being a
hermaphrodite variety as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: dioecious being what's common for us to
understand that we have both a male and a
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting to see, and it makes
sense there, that obviously the dioecious
[SPEAKER_00]: hamp, a cluster closer to the narrow leaf
drug type, and then we see essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: divergence towards the broad leaf,
indica, afganica, whatever we want to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really is quite interesting that we
can tease apart a pattern here from a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger pool of samples than what had been
seen previously using single nucleotide
[SPEAKER_00]: polymorphism, which are possibly both
functional or under selection and also
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to talk more about SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: John mentioned them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially this is what they look like
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a single pair difference on a
sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most common sources of
polymorphism, so essentially the source of
[SPEAKER_00]: variation that's most commonly found.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is typically thought to arise from a
mistake in replication, basically from one
[SPEAKER_00]: cell cycle to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also one of the means of
generating diversity, so using mutagens
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nature does it all on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't necessarily require us,
and typically we see an average frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: of about one SNP for every thousand base
pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're talking about the cannabis
genome, we see that there's actually quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit more SNPs, so a large amount of
diversity, about one SNP every hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: base pairs in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what I want to talk about
here, and this is an example from one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the licensed producers in Canada that I
knew their horticultural director,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he came to me and said, something very
interesting happened in one of our strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that we bought from the BC Bud Depot,
which is probably not the most recognized
[SPEAKER_00]: seed source.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially they have a variety called
Shiatsu Kush, which they claim is from
[SPEAKER_00]: Japan, which it's not, but it's typically
a high THC variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here in this case, as you can
see, something happened in the production
[SPEAKER_00]: line that caused one plant to express CBG
in almost an equal concentration to THC
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't have to be a mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be an insertion of a transposable
element inside of an active THC synthase
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really quite interesting how one
of the reasons why they pick this up is
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have to QA, QC test their
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the one sample test comes back
with a high CBG, they don't believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's happening, so they resend the same
plant, and they see that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: something happened to one of the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to see that they're actually
producing it as a plant and offering it as
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine to people that would be
interested in having access to different
[SPEAKER_00]: minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a mutation can happen in a small ACMP
greenhouse or a grow house in Whistler,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, it's definitely happening in those
fields out there all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just not looking for it because of
the scales we're growing at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that I did,
essentially using data from medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason why I'm here is
because of the philosophy of sharing this
[SPEAKER_00]: type of information with people to be able
to, there's a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't all go through it and decipher
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got the NRC logo up here,
and that's a little bit of a wave to John
[SPEAKER_00]: Page because as you see, the USO 31 and
the phenol samples there came from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all in silico data downloaded
from the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, thanks to medicinal genomics
and John's group for sharing that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially what I do is use statistical
approaches to be able to now decipher
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics and make it a little bit more
approachable and maybe fast track some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these developments as we're talking about
marker-assisted selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you see that clustering,
like we said, we've got phenol out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, and then we have the drug-type
cannabis that have some kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is done with 28 accessions
and starting with a data set of 180,000
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is in silico, I managed to
use statistical analyses like discriminant
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis of principle component to reduce
this 180,000 SNP data set to a set of 42
[SPEAKER_00]: that in silico on the computer provided
the exact same pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's something that I did also way
back in the day, a 3D PCA that then was
[SPEAKER_00]: used by some other groups that are
presenting their data in a fashion like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the same principle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that there is a clustering going
on, but again, a very basic structure that
[SPEAKER_00]: we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what I set out to do with the
data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another follow-up study in 2017 was
essentially compared to Indica sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took data from the internet on
terpene expression, and then what I did
[SPEAKER_00]: there is that I forced the software to
say, okay, on the left here, I'm gonna say
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica sativa hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they differentiate themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, they're all overlapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tested a couple of options,
including some of what the Napro research
[SPEAKER_00]: had done, which they said I think it was
limonene, karyophylline, and mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did that and I did another
essentially clustering possibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was mercine, terpenaline,
and limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, this was kind of what was
the best cluster that I showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what I did from that is I
took the genetic data, constrained it
[SPEAKER_00]: based on these three classes, and was able
to have a data set that almost perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: clustered these groups into their relevant
groups here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of a proof of concept,
but essentially this data is available on
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have these 21 markers that are available
for people to download and play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is really just digested
information from Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the study with terpenes and digipath
really kind of came as a followup to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and going from 70-something samples to now
about 5,000 samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all terpene data, so you see
all of the variables there, limonene,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see how essentially the software
can cluster these groups into three
[SPEAKER_00]: different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just drug-type cannabis,
but typically a mercine,
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-karyophylline dominant in red,
a terpenaline dominant group, and an
[SPEAKER_00]: limonene dominant group with obviously
some other terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we get a really consistent clustering
of these three groups based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotypic data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is the same kind of concept
using fancy statistics to simplify and
[SPEAKER_00]: really actually generate synthetic
variables called principal components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here what you can see is out of those
5,000 individuals, 70 samples that were
[SPEAKER_00]: sequenced essentially with a similar
genotyping by sequencing approach by
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that there's still,
that cluster still holds essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's still some overlap there,
and it's not a perfect fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially from that data set,
I was able to generate 48 sets of primers
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wanted to validate from the
incident in silico on the computer studies
[SPEAKER_00]: to now being able to say we can do this in
the lab in a reputable fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interestingly out of 48 markers,
we really only had about 23 that were
[SPEAKER_00]: validated, so nine of them just never even
amplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's based on the large amount
of SNPs in the priming areas of the
[SPEAKER_00]: primers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that 16 that showed polymorphism
on in silico data were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: monomorphic, even between hemp and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially out of that, 18 of them were
associated with terpene expression as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just an idea of the assignment
where we compare the genome GBS,
[SPEAKER_00]: so 10,000 SNPs against 18 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the statistical
assignment to the different groups is
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very close, you know, with
essentially 1,000 times less markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also being confirmed by some
other groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially this is a study out of New
Mexico that shows the same kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: clustering with mersene, terpenaline,
and limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that I validated
with a licensed producer in British
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia that I work with called the
Flower Corporation, where essentially now
[SPEAKER_00]: we've taken, we see hemp here clustering
by itself, and those are X59 and phenol
[SPEAKER_00]: samples, a mersene dominant group.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see here is the little cloud,
the green cloud, that's actually a pinin
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant accession that has pinin and
mersene, but pinin is quite a bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see at the bottom,
the pink is hemp samples, and so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not all distributed in one part,
but you can identify hemp very easily with
[SPEAKER_00]: this approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what this is, I don't see it,
but this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing the same data here,
and what it shows is the markers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with the clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top left there is hemp,
and we see mito, so it's a mitochondrial
[SPEAKER_00]: marker that's always fixed in hemp,
and then SW6, which is actually a THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase marker that I developed that
enable you to refutably identify hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: so CBD hemp versus CBD drug type cannabis
anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the same, when you look at hemp,
there's different phenotypes in the fields
[SPEAKER_00]: that are also associated with the height
and also the fragrance of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, the last thing that I did
is essentially take the small set of
[SPEAKER_00]: markers, so actually just 23 of them,
and I took all the data from Canapedia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to see if we're able to
identify strains, and again here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I added a few of them, but one of the data
that they show is a good clustering in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the Blue Dream accessions,
and the same with the Durban poison,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's just nice to see that this
actually translates across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much everybody for the
attention, not much time for questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Round of applause.
Thank you.
