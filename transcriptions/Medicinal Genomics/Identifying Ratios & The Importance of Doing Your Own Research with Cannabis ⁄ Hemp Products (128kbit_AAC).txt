[SPEAKER_00]: The value of the study that you're doing
is to try to identify what are those good
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios and make sure that they're
available to people in other states,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know that's not the case
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not have sort of that high CBD,
low THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in some states, it's just all THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're lucky if you find any CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that would be a great benefit
of this work is to really figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: that good ratio is and inform the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things I'm really
grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm independent, I'm not like
full-time employed by anybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: just me, Ask Nurse Laura.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that I get to work because with
nursing, I can work in other states and
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to companies and talk to researchers,
about the different products also in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp space and what's out there that we're
seeing as beneficial and where are those
[SPEAKER_01]: gaps, what's missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to educate people on how to be a smart
hemp consumer even, like how to find a
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable hemp company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully in our network, we have some
good people that have some good products,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there also is a lot of garbage out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a secret shopper campaign in the
state of Delaware.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for hemp shops and it was kind of
scary what we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot because it's not so
regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to encourage people to do
their homework and learn how to dig into
[SPEAKER_01]: the details, not just trust, like Google
reviews and not just trust a handshake.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to know what we're getting,
what we're putting in our body because
[SPEAKER_01]: even if today it doesn't cause a negative
effect, some of the things that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: in some of these products might cause
issues down the road that we don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that could be a whole other podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I think we should do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of the things I was going
to ask, but then I remembered that the
[SPEAKER_00]: study is restricted to getting products
from a dispensary because I was curious,
[SPEAKER_00]: are people using hemp-derived
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sort of these synthetic cannabinoids
like Delta-8-THC or some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: things for PTSD?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a later study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe you don't know, but when
you're trying to get approved by an IRB,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is an independent review board.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of specifics that you
have to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to do everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our first study.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope to do so many more research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to do something to get off
the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to find ways to sort of
level the playing field just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a group called CANRA,
the Cannabis Regulators Association that
[SPEAKER_01]: brings together cannabis regulators from
multiple states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, at some point, we're going
to have some more standard across the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the challenges that I find
is standards from state to state,
[SPEAKER_01]: accessibility from state to state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to take the time to figure out what
the regulations are, what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: standards in this state, especially for
business owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a contract with Brightview
Assisted Living because they want their
[SPEAKER_01]: residents to be able to access cannabis
and utilize cannabis in their facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these people are this is the end
of their life is going to be in this
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want them to have a good quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They operate in eight states up and down
the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even in the states, they all have
medical programs, but they have different
[SPEAKER_01]: rules and different products in each of
their programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to standardize a policy and
standardize implementation for them is
[SPEAKER_01]: really challenging.
Yeah.
Yeah.
