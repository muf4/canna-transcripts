[SPEAKER_00]: And good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Kevalyn Barbosa Xavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevalyn is a PhD student in Plant
Biotechnology at UENF, where she conducts
[SPEAKER_00]: research under the supervision of Tiago
Mata Venancio.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a computational biologist
investigating the genes and gene networks
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in secondary plant metabolic
pathways and fiber production,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically in the cannabis Sistiva
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevalyn and her team recently published a
study titled Cannabis Expression Atlas,
[SPEAKER_00]: a comprehensive resource for integrative
analysis of cannabis sativa gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression, along with a free online tool
to help researchers analyze genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence data.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discussed the
team's main objectives in creating the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis expression atlas, how our
understanding of the cannabis genome
[SPEAKER_00]: compares to other commercial crops,
how gene expression data can advance plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and genetic engineering,
potential applications of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: expression atlas in commercial cannabis
cultivation, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Kevalyn, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal Genomics uses its unmatched
knowledge of the cannabis genome and the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes affecting cannabis plants to
create diverse testing solutions that
[SPEAKER_00]: improve crop yield, accelerate breeding
programs, and ensure product safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers and breeders use MGC's Cannabis
Genome Sequencing Services to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: novel traits, stabilize genetics,
and protect intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, canapedia.net provides
bioinformatics and blockchain
[SPEAKER_00]: certification for cultivar authenticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at medicinalgenomics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Kevalyn
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbosa Xavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Kevalyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I'm excited to talk with you
today about a new resource that your team
[SPEAKER_00]: has put together to advance cannabis
genomics research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in a new study called Cannabis
Expression Atlas, a comprehensive resource
[SPEAKER_00]: for integrative analysis of cannabis
sativa gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an effort and it's research that's
near and dear to our hearts here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely excited to talk with you
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think to start, it would be great if
you could tell us what inspired you to
[SPEAKER_00]: undertake this study of cannabis and focus
on developing a gene expression database.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say that the recent changes
in the regulation of cannabis use and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation around the world have opened
up opportunities to research with these
[SPEAKER_01]: species to be conversed more broadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has led to a rapid increase in the
amount of information available about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, including RNA sequence data.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, these data are often in the raw
form, meaning that while the RNA sequence
[SPEAKER_01]: files are available in public databases,
for example, without proper filtering and
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis, they aren't very affirmative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and additional to this, not all of
this data are linked to published
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where the idea of the Cannabis
Expression Atlas came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal was to create a database that
translates the RNA sequence data,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak, transforming raw sequence
information into easy to use and refining
[SPEAKER_01]: data to anyone interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're translating that data to make it
more useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I noticed when I was reading
through the abstract in the paper is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you chose to use the Jamaican lion
reference, which again, near and dear to
[SPEAKER_00]: our heart at Medicinal Genomics,
our team is the one who put that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that reference benefit the
study?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, during my initial research,
I realized that there was no consensus
[SPEAKER_01]: about which reference genome to use in
cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this made me want to look further to
available genomes for these species to
[SPEAKER_01]: choose the most suitable one for use in
our study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found that most of other genomes came
from female plants and were from type 1 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 3 chemo types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when the Jamaican lion genome
caught my attention, because first it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: type 2 variant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it means that it has both CHCAS and
CBGAS genes active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And additionally, both male and female
plants were sequenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the researchers from the Medicinal
Genomics had identified a region
[SPEAKER_01]: corresponding to the Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a key feature compared to
other available genomes, which as I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, are all from female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using this genome as a reference allow
us to enrich our database and identify
[SPEAKER_01]: expression patterns for Y chromosomes
genes, for example, which can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: useful for helping researchers to better
understand sex differentiation in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Jamaican lion genome, it covers
more ground because it has the CHCAS,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CBD and the Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were your main objectives in
creating the cannabis expression atlas and
[SPEAKER_00]: how does this work address gaps in
existing cannabis research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, initially creating the cannabis
expression atlas was not our main goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I began my research with cannabis,
I needed this RNA sequence data primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: to explore gene expression profiles
related to specific traits of the species
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are working.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so my initial plan was simply to build
an internal database for this purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we collected and processed the
data, we realized how slow and labor-sum
[SPEAKER_01]: and computationally demanding this process
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's when we thought about making
the process expression data available to
[SPEAKER_01]: other researchers because not all labs
have the staff or the computational
[SPEAKER_01]: research for this level of processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tried to develop a tool that would
be useful not only for researchers waiting
[SPEAKER_01]: to download and use expression data in
other types of analysis, but also for
[SPEAKER_01]: those just seeking more information on a
specific gene, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without needing to download
everything, download all the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, it lets users can
access gene expression directly from the
[SPEAKER_01]: tool itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that's the core of the
cannabis expression atlas, making complex
[SPEAKER_01]: gene expression information accessible and
clear and interactive for anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of taking a step back and just
talking about cannabis genome research in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, how does our understanding,
our collective understanding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis genome compare to other
commercial crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that our understanding of
the cannabis genome is advancing quickly,
[SPEAKER_01]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: For other species, knowledge was developed
readily as new technologies were created.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that cannabis research is more
widely accepted, these advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies are ready and well
established.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it means that the research progress
that took decades for other crops like
[SPEAKER_01]: corn or soybeans can be achieved much
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: For cannabis, that said, there is still a
lot to uncover about this species.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe that in just a few years,
we will reach a level of understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: comparable to what we currently have for
major commercial crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's encouraging to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, from the practical side, in your
experience, to what extent have cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators embraced using genomics and
genomic tools?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that it depends on whether
we are talking about small cultivators or
[SPEAKER_01]: big farms, because I believe that big
farms are already using genome tools to
[SPEAKER_01]: guide breeding process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe that in general,
for cultivators, the use of genomic tools
[SPEAKER_01]: is, let's say, indirect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through, for example, seeds of newly
developed cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that it depends on the small
cultivars or big farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I want to dig in a little bit to
the study that your team published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it revealed substantial variability in
gene expression among different tissues
[SPEAKER_00]: and chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were some of the most surprising
things that you found in that analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the first thing that caught
our attention was that we initially
[SPEAKER_01]: expected that the white genes to show more
specific expression in samples from male
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But only a small proportion of the genes
on the white chromosome are expressed
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusively in the male flower,
while many other genes were expressed in
[SPEAKER_01]: samples from other tissues, including
those from female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so searching about that, I see that
this pattern can be explained by some
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers indicating that only a small
proportion of the white chromosome is
[SPEAKER_01]: unique, with the majority being shared
with the X chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still a thing that needs more
deep attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another notable finding was the clustering
of the trichomes samples, because as we
[SPEAKER_01]: know, trichomes are where the synthesis
and storage of the medicinal compounds are
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we observed that the trichomes samples
showed very similar expression profiles,
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of chemotype, indicating that
it's likely that only a small number of
[SPEAKER_01]: genes that differentiate these chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's something that needs more
deeper interpretations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying parts of the Y chromosome
can actually be found in female plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genes provenance from the Y region also
have expression in other tissues,
[SPEAKER_01]: including in female tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could you discuss the significance of
these and other findings for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant biology and practical applications?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that understanding our subject
of study, in this case, the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the most crucial step to cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And utilizing this plant as efficiently as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that in mind, I believe that R2
will significantly aid in generating
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge about the plant in a broad
sense, because it can be useful to those
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on industrial properties,
as well as those interested in the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal attributes, and by providing
clear and accessible gene expression data,
[SPEAKER_01]: we believe that we are helping to pave the
way for better informed research and
[SPEAKER_01]: applications in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more specifically, how might this gene
expression information support
[SPEAKER_00]: advancements in areas like plant breeding
or genetic engineering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned earlier, our understanding
of the subject of this study is the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gene expression information can be
used to identify genes directly associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with traits of interest, for example,
such as cannabinoid synthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber production, or seed development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing what genes are involved in and
how their expression profiles influence
[SPEAKER_01]: these traits, is crucial for making
decisions about genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, it could help in modifying
variety by adding or silencing genes to
[SPEAKER_01]: control the presence or the intensity of
the certain traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a practical application might be
ensuring that hemorrhages, like chemotype
[SPEAKER_01]: 3, for example, don't produce any THC if
it was the interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into more specifically the
cannabis expression Atlas, could you walk
[SPEAKER_00]: us through some of the main features of
the tool and what types of users do you
[SPEAKER_00]: envision benefiting from it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tool was designed to be as
comprehensive as possible so that users
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need to rely on multiple platforms
to gather the information they need about
[SPEAKER_01]: the genie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we integrated RNA-seq expression data
with functional information about the
[SPEAKER_01]: genies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, we have an internship
table where users can explore cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genies even if they don't know the gene
ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because users can search for genies by
name, search ATP synthetes, and find all
[SPEAKER_01]: related genies in this database.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also search by transcription
factor, family names, by gene ontology
[SPEAKER_01]: terms, by expression patterns categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone is interested in identifying
housekeeping genies or TC-specific genies,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can easily find that information as
well for all the expression classes that
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And additionally, we included a heat map
to visualize the expression gene of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest, which will help to interpret
some results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And beside that, given the lack of
organization in genie genomic culture
[SPEAKER_01]: across cannabis genomes and in other
blended
[SPEAKER_01]: genomes, we included a vast tool in the
Cannabis expression Atlas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this means that if the user is
interested in a specific genie but doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have enough information to search for it
through the other tools in the Atlas,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can simply input the genie or the
protein sequence and do a blast search
[SPEAKER_01]: again the Atlas to identify the genie
within the database and access the related
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that this tool will be
especially useful for researchers,
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps indirectly for Q2 medias,
because while it's easy to use and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: basic understanding of genomic culture and
how to interpret genomic and transcript
[SPEAKER_01]: data is necessary to fully leverage the
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any limitations in the Cannabis
expression Atlas that you aim to address
[SPEAKER_00]: with any future updates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the future, we plan to make some
visual and navigation improvements to the
[SPEAKER_01]: tool, such as enhancing the mobile version
and making the interactions between
[SPEAKER_01]: different pages and internal tools more
seamless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another feature we didn't include in
this version but plan to implement in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future is the ability to search for
information based on Q2 names,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I believe this could be useful for
some users who are more focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: specific varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are also open to suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wrapping up, how do you foresee this
database influencing global cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really hope that this database
will play a significant role in advancing
[SPEAKER_01]: global cannabis search by providing a
comprehensive, accessible resource for
[SPEAKER_01]: genie-expressed data.
[SPEAKER_01]: By making this information freely
available and easy to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope to accelerate research across
various fields from medicinal to
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I believe that this database can
serve as a foundation for new studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enabling researchers to quickly access and
analyze data without need for extensive
[SPEAKER_01]: reprocessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the end of the day, this tool will
help unify and streamline the global
[SPEAKER_01]: research for leading to a more efficient
and collaborative approach to
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding cannabis biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that very well aligns with our
company and our ethos of trying to put as
[SPEAKER_00]: much data public and easily accessible to
enhance the understanding for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Kevin, thank you again so much
for joining me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who wants to check out the Cannabis
Expression Atlas, I'll put a link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: show description so they can easily get to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a link to the study as well so they
can read up about more about how you put
[SPEAKER_00]: that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we can do this again soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
