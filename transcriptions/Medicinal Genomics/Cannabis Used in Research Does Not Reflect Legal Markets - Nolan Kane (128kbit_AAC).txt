[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much to the organizers for
inviting me, and to all of you for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm a plant geneticist, and like John,
I find this plant really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to me to come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a great group of people
with different interests, different
[SPEAKER_00]: skills, different backgrounds,
and some of you in the audience are really
[SPEAKER_00]: helping to build a solid foundation of our
understanding of how this plant affects
[SPEAKER_00]: us, starting with one enzyme, I mean,
sorry, starting with one cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe one terpene at a time,
and understanding how that works with our
[SPEAKER_00]: own CB1 and CB2 receptors, and other
aspects of our physiology to create an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people are starting with the plant
side of things, and taking the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: messiness and complexity that's in the
plant material, or parts of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeing how that affects people,
and using that as a treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I really get into the main message
that I want to say, I think it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to think about things starting
from both directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we know that the plant has a lot
of important effects on a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: key traits, key pathways in our own
bodies, but we don't really understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: it works because of the complexity of all
of the different terpenes and cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that we just heard about, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, we know the effects of
some key molecules, but if it was as
[SPEAKER_00]: simple as one molecule creating a lot of
these effects, Marinol would be success,
[SPEAKER_00]: and almost nobody uses Marinol,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it doesn't have some of the same
properties of the plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't really understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind as I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just thinking about how I got here,
when I started as a professor a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago in Colorado, a lot of changes were
happening on the legal side.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we all know, a lot of different states
are starting to experiment with this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and creating these state legal markets
where we can start to see what people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we're starting to see the
effects of some of these state markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people are starting to do some
science, but the science that's being done
[SPEAKER_00]: now, really dates back a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis science, there's mentions of
cannabis in the oldest medical texts in
[SPEAKER_00]: both Asia and Europe, so it's something
that's been recognized for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's something important about
this plant, and yet we still don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand very much how that's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's despite really a lot of great work
by people, but it's a complicated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, in the US anyway, most of the
science that's being done on the real
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical side of things has to go through
the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the sole legal provider of most
kinds of cannabis products for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: research in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 1968.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one source in Mississippi has been
really where all marijuana products for
[SPEAKER_00]: most kinds of studies on human physiology
or animal effects are coming from,
[SPEAKER_00]: really this one source, and most published
studies used a very limited pool of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis diversity with only two or three
percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, very low levels of THC,
and also very low levels of any other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, very anecdotally anyway,
very little in the way of terpenes or
[SPEAKER_00]: other key plant compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: NIDA has recognized finally that this is
maybe an issue, and they've been trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase some of the THC levels and other
cannabinoid levels and diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think what I wanted to do as
part of this is to think about how
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant, or how, I guess, how what's
available from NIDA compares to what's
[SPEAKER_00]: available in the state markets,
and how relevant is that, or when we try
[SPEAKER_00]: to compare what's in these medical studies
to what people are saying anecdotally,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we make that connection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to put things in perspective,
I thought I'd look at how many different
[SPEAKER_00]: papers talked about medical health effects
and the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
[SPEAKER_00]: so derived some of their findings either
directly or indirectly from information
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from these strains, and we're
talking about thousands of papers every
[SPEAKER_00]: year are at least mentioning marijuana
health effects and National Institute on
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug Abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily definitive,
but I'm just pointing out a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are using information derived from this to
make some kinds of claims, scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: claims, and mostly this is focused on
mostly THC and now CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of work on CBG and CBN,
but these are basically the decarboxylated
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown products of some of the
cannabinoids, and they're more typically
[SPEAKER_00]: thought to be more bioactive than the
things that are in the plant, but
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a limited number of cannabinoids
people are talking about, and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: something about the genetics of if you
have a hemp strain, you might have some
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in how much CBD is there,
but typically most of the cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be CBD, very little THC,
whereas marijuana strains are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly THC, very little CBD, and if you
compare across them, you get a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture of different genetics,
so each of these dots is a different
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic variety that in these cases have
novel cannabinoid profiles different than
[SPEAKER_00]: either of their parents, and that's really
the basis of a lot of modern cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, but really most of the work
that's being done is only looking at a
[SPEAKER_00]: very limited number of the diversity of
cannabinoids, so this is just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny, these are all different cannabinoids
that you'd find in the plant, these are
[SPEAKER_00]: just a small section of the diversity,
and this is their biosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then these are some different
breakdown products that can happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see these are some different
terpenes, and you can see that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from some of the same precursors,
so related biosynthetic pathways,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is just a tiny portion of the
chemical diversity that's in the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really being looked at,
but there's a reason for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, is that these are some of the
major cannabinoids in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to mention some great work
that Ryan Lynch did when he was in my lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: now he's at Inicidal Genomics doing great
work there, but basically what I want you
[SPEAKER_00]: to get out of this complicated slide is
that there's some genetic lineages,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is based on genome sequencing of a
large number, a large proportion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity, of course there's always more
that you could wish for to be included,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we were able to pull out hemp lineages
as being distinct from broadleaf drug
[SPEAKER_00]: types and narrowleaf drug types,
these are things that have a lot of THC in
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and then a lot of things that are
hybrids, mixtures of different genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: components, so this is just a,
this is called genetic network,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing some of the connections
representing the major genetic lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really I want to get at is that there
are some, in this case we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify three different genetic lineages
that were pretty clear, and if we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical diversity, we can see they
differed CBDA and THCA, so there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between broadleaf and
narrowleaf, but also bigger differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between either of them, and hemp in terms
of how much THC, of course hemp has very
[SPEAKER_00]: low THC and much higher CBD, this is just
limited sample of diversity, but still I
[SPEAKER_00]: think tells somewhat of a clear story,
and if we look at the more minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, we can see that those same
three lineages differ in some of,
[SPEAKER_00]: so precursor molecules just basically vary
a lot, how much is in the plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to basically depend more on when
you harvest it and how you grow it,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than any genetic differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these different minor cannabinoids
actually do differ, at least in our
[SPEAKER_00]: sample, differed between the major genetic
lineages, and others didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically where I'm going to,
where I'm going to leave it at that,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that there could be some key diversity
differences in some of the more minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly with some of the terpenes,
again there's some things that vary a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: within the different lineages and are not
significant, so the same letter means
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest difference, at least in our
sample, in the terpenes was in mercine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and several others have suggested that
might cause some of the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between some of the major genetic
lineages, in terms of some of their
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, could be due to mercine,
but who knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to keep that, just keep that in
mind, that these terpenes and terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're mainly responsible for the odor
and flavor, but they have antimicrobial
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are already known to interact
with the CB1 or CB2 receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also do seem to interact with the
cannabinoids, based on some limited
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence, to lead to alterations in the
psychological effect, and the science
[SPEAKER_00]: behind that is pretty limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, but it's limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing is, if you go into
dispensary, you'll find a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that have very similar levels of
THC, and yet have dramatic differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: their effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not just about THC,
it's about something related to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these other compounds in there,
very well might be some of these terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to compare, okay,
so there's all this diversity out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of diversity is available for
federally legal research at universities?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does NIDA compare to what's in the
state markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to show a few of the
cannabinoids, if we look at CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we had to calculate CBD levels,
because the federal government only
[SPEAKER_00]: releases CBD, they don't break it down
into CBD versus CBDA, or THC versus THCA,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they use GC technology to measure
their cannabinoids, and so what they
[SPEAKER_00]: report doesn't include that information,
so we had to convert our values to
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent decarboxylated versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for those of you who care about that,
I know there should be an A after it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in this case, the data we have is on
CBD from the federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we compare what's available,
you can see they actually do a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: job for CBD in terms of the range of
different values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these represents a different
NIDA strain and their reported levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, and you can see there's a fair amount
of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, their CBD lines are lower in
CBD than what you get in state markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at least the range of diversity is
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at THC levels, you can see
it's much lower than anything that would
[SPEAKER_00]: ever be sold by a reputable dispensary
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's about a quarter as much as
you'd ever get in a dispensary in most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cases, except for, of course,
it's more similar to the THC levels in
[SPEAKER_00]: like one-to-one or variable lines that
have a mixture of THC and CBD in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these dispensaries, but on average,
five to 10% is on the high end for what
[SPEAKER_00]: NIDA makes available for research.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG is not that different between the
federal materials and the state markets
[SPEAKER_00]: for at least the lines that have CBG,
but they don't have anything that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: listed that has substantial THCV,
which is potentially a quite interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabinoid, but not present in any
of the NIDA material according to their
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, so that's sort of the
averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the, another view, another way
of looking at the diversity is for lines
[SPEAKER_00]: that have both CBD and THC in them at more
than 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking out the lines that are just pure
CBD or mainly CBD or mainly THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of diversity does NIDA offer of
things that have more than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it's only low levels of
total cannabinoids and also only a subset
[SPEAKER_00]: of the range of variation in CBD to THC
ratio is available in the lines that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have listed compared to the broader
diversity available in the state markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not necessarily totally
irrelevant, but it only tells us a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the story of why people are using cannabis
products in the state markets and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential range of effects of those
cannabis products, both good and bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not able to be studied using this kind
of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go broader and look at all of the
total cannabinoids, it's basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: same kind of story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically this is taking a whole broad
range of cannabinoids, distilling it
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically down into only two axes,
principal component one, principal
[SPEAKER_00]: component two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is this just tells you,
it helps us visualize the diversity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical, the phytochemical diversity
available in some of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just comparing Oakland, Sacramento and
NIDA, we can see that NIDA again only has
[SPEAKER_00]: a tiny range of variation compared to
what's available in the state markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see also a lot of the state
markets have also these outliers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: even more unusual plant material,
whereas the NIDA material has very little
[SPEAKER_00]: in the way of these extreme outliers and
really only covers a very small range of
[SPEAKER_00]: the total diversity, the phytochemical
diversity that's present in the state
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to think about that a little bit
more, we've heard today about the effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of individual cannabinoids or groupings of
cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that is certainly done at the
university level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of what we hear about is,
I guess a lot of what you read about in
[SPEAKER_00]: the papers is gonna be limited because
NIDA has very different levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have roughly a quarter of the THC
levels in their THC lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically have lower CBD levels than
when you get a state market, but I would
[SPEAKER_00]: argue that it's not as extreme as the THC
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially no measurable THCV,
CBC or other what we call what some people
[SPEAKER_00]: term minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should also point out that they don't
even report terpene levels for their
[SPEAKER_00]: material that they send out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't request material easily,
at least to have a particular terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the research using NIDA marijuana
is limited in terms of what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene diversity is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things that I haven't shown
you from NIDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some cannabinoids that are
actually higher in NIDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually one in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: NIDA has 11 to 23 times the CBN content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that tell you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's also old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBN is a natural breakdown product of
Delta-9-THC due to oxidation or UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other processes occur over time leading to
CBN to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one possible explanation using
information from NIDA's website that I got
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say the university designates a
secure plot of land where marijuana crops
[SPEAKER_00]: are grown every few years based on current
and expected demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marijuana is grown, harvested,
stored and made available as bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana or other purified elements of
marijuana to use for research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every few years, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that explains why it has 11 to 23
times as much of the breakdown products of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids as anything you'd ever see in
a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say this is not necessarily an
innocuous issue because we know all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these cannabinoids are interacting with
each other to create the physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that the research grade
materials are so heavily degraded that
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have substantial terpenes and
have much higher rates of the breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: products limits our ability to really
understand what's happening when people
[SPEAKER_00]: are using very different material in the
state market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would argue that, you know,
this issue not having lower levels of most
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, a lower diversity of
cannabinoids and higher levels of the
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown products of THC and CBD
suggests, I would argue that's a major
[SPEAKER_00]: issue when we're trying to understand the
effects of the marijuana that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: using in the state markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would advocate that something needs
to change such that ongoing and future
[SPEAKER_00]: research can be improved in terms of its
relevance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need materials with higher diversity of
cannabinoids, higher levels of relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: products, lower levels of degradation
products unless you're interested
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically in studying those degradation
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also making sure that we have relevant
levels of the key terpenes and terpenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to briefly thank people before my
time totally runs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daniella Vergara, my post-doc did the bulk
of the statistical analysis along with
[SPEAKER_00]: Sidman Bidwell and my collaborator in the
Psych and Neuroscience Department,
[SPEAKER_00]: see you Kent Hutchinson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the genetic analysis that I mentioned
in the beginning was done by Ryan Lynch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And funding from several different sources
and although mainly actually from
[SPEAKER_00]: donations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I really should thank Steve Hill
for their expertise on the chemical side
[SPEAKER_00]: of things and their help with
understanding and generating a lot of this
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
