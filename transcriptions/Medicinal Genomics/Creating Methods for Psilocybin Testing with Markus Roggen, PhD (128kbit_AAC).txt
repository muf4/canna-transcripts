[SPEAKER_00]: details about our CanMed 23 event later
this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'll put this request at the top of
the episode this time, but if you enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast and want to help us out,
the best thing you can do is leave a
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give us a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those reviews are a signal to the
algorithms and the podcast apps that
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest new shows to users, that this is a
quality program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll provide a link in the show notes
so it's easy for you to find, and we
[SPEAKER_00]: really appreciate your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, we welcome back Marcus
Roggen, president and chief scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: officer at Delic Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus has been in the cannabis industry
since 2014 and has held several executive
[SPEAKER_00]: positions in analytical and production
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: His research into process optimization and
analytical methods have been recognized
[SPEAKER_00]: with a number of awards, and he has become
a trusted advisor and mentor to multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: startups, startup accelerators,
and organizations, including CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Delic Labs, Marcus and his team have
spent the past two years developing
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical methods for psilocybin and
other psychedelics, which is an emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's following in the footsteps of the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss how
the regulations in Canada make it more
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable for psychedelic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does psilocybin medicine look like
and how is it created?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether psilocybin will become a mass
market recreational product?
[SPEAKER_00]: How psilocybin analytics differs from
cannabinoid analytics?
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between psilocybin and
psilocin?
[SPEAKER_00]: What types of impurities and contaminants
are a concern with psilocybin products?
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of discovering new tryptamine
compounds in psychedelic mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the future research projects that
Marcus is working on, including looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin extraction and optimal storage
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Marcus, I do want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Agilent Technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manufacture or test cannabis,
you face the challenge of delivering high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality products, increasing sample
volume, and meeting emerging regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agilent offers best in-class cannabis and
hemp analysis solutions featuring robust
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments, software, services,
and consumables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their team of experts can develop,
implement, and optimize methods to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: up and running quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information, visit Agilent.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus Roggen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So psilocybin seems to be the next big
thing in natural medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: States, they're beginning to allow it to
be used for a variety of conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most experts expect it will
follow a similar path to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: where eventually psilocybin products will
be sold in dispensaries to qualified
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps one day it'll also be
available for adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before any of that can happen,
there needs to be proper testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I want to talk with you
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, Marcus, please tell the people a
bit about who you are, what you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you got involved in psilocybin
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure, I'm happy to answer the
questions that I can from a chemistry
[SPEAKER_03]: background.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in chemistry background, here's the
name of the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a PhD in chemistry, which the
academic career eventually brought me to
[SPEAKER_03]: North America, where I then started the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you ask it about how did I get to
psilocybin or psychedelic compounds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most people in the industry nowadays,
they came from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had built and operated a research
laboratory for cannabis in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were licensed by Health Canada to do
cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were associated or friendly with the
University of British Columbia in
[SPEAKER_03]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did a lot of weird and wonderful
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how did I get to psychedelics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Health Canada carved out a licensing
pathway to do psychedelic research in a
[SPEAKER_03]: legal framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things that lots of people in the US
cannot imagine that the compound of
[SPEAKER_03]: interest is legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use a credit card to order it on
the internet and get it sent by the mail
[SPEAKER_03]: to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is possible in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are, and we are able to work
with cannabis, psychedelic compounds,
[SPEAKER_03]: and do a lot of process research and
analytical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in Canada, the regulations,
is it opened up mainly for research or can
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers go online and place an order?
[SPEAKER_03]: For cannabis, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabis is recreational legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the provincial governments,
so like the state governments in the US,
[SPEAKER_03]: they have opened web stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would go to the web store of the
British Columbia government and order
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, and then it gets sent to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not the case for psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So psychedelics have been carved out under
regulation aspect of experimental drug
[SPEAKER_03]: that initially it was only medical trials
on psychedelic compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pure psilocybin synthesized.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are, I think, a handful of trials on
actual psychedelic mushrooms and then
[SPEAKER_03]: other psychedelic compounds like MDMA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the Canadian government or the
Health Canada authorities approve a
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical trial, so obviously you need your
patients for it, you need your doctors,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need your protocols for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all well and good, but the Canadian
government realizes we also need the
[SPEAKER_03]: supply of the materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: So therefore they started licensing
producers to make psychedelic mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_03]: to synthesize psilocybin, or to make other
psychedelic drugs like MDMA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the third carve out,
which is a research license.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under which we are operating for now that
they need to be outside testing or
[SPEAKER_03]: analytics development.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the part we are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it stands right now, as a patient,
the only way you kind of are getting legal
[SPEAKER_00]: access to psilocybin is if you're enrolled
in one of these trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that was true and the only pathway
until January 2022.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Health Canada authorities
expanded it into that for specific
[SPEAKER_03]: complicated cases, one doctor could get
one patient onto psychedelic treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is now, in addition to the
clinical trials, which are larger,
[SPEAKER_03]: take longer, you can now get treated as an
individual patient with psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's a good foundation for us to
build on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking at analyzing these
products, what are we actually looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are these products created?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you had mentioned, is it a
synthesized or an extracted single
[SPEAKER_00]: compound of psilocybin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are the mushrooms actually ground up
and put into capsules?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are our patients actually eating the
mushrooms like we did in college?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about eating mushrooms
straight up in the clinical trial setting
[SPEAKER_03]: or individual patient side, but otherwise
all of the above.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are producers in Canada and then
importers into Canada that would bring or
[SPEAKER_03]: make available psychedelic mushrooms that
are grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are mostly milled into powders and
then given in capsules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the Canadian based mushroom
growers we work with or we are in contact
[SPEAKER_03]: with, they are still in a research phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are still trying to find out which
mushrooms they actually want to grow large
[SPEAKER_03]: for production.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to find the right strains
or cultivars to produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think strains is actually the more
correct term in the mushroom world than it
[SPEAKER_03]: is in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Side note.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are very early there and finding
the right mushroom they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then aside from the milled powdered
mushroom, you see basically exclusively in
[SPEAKER_03]: medical trials, pure synthesized
psilocybin or other psychedelic compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like MDMA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are synthesized in the chemistry lab
from scratch.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't make any difference between
psilocybin from the mushroom or psilocybin
[SPEAKER_03]: synthesized same molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the impurity profile that you get
when you consume a mushroom that could be
[SPEAKER_03]: of concern or benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking entourage effect here as we
know it from the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that exists in mushrooms, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: More work needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there extraction going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they really made it onto the market
of clinical trials?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's very early.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like all the mushroom growers are
in BC and Alberta.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where also all the cannabis growers used
to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know of one company here near
Vancouver that has developed their own
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction methods and supposedly they're
very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is an interesting aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in your intro, you said maybe
psychedelics or psilocybin mushrooms might
[SPEAKER_03]: become a recreational product in the
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I highly doubt that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I highly doubt that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there is a recreational use already
in the subcultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't see the value proposition of a
mushroom trip for a social gathering.
[SPEAKER_03]: True.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about something like microdosing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And psychedelics have such a strong
medical potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the psychological side, I'm not sure
that it can be a mass market recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: product like cannabis can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because intoxication is a psychological
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Intoxication could be like a subgroup of
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm getting properly slammed by
professionals in that field.
[SPEAKER_03]: But psychedelic compounds are so much
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a problem seeing that as a mass
market product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe it has a stronger claim to fame
for medical product than cannabis has.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned microdosing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a really, really good study from
late last year that compared microdosing
[SPEAKER_03]: to the placebo effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it were the same numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they sent capsules to study
participants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had to use these capsules and
then report back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a crossover.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some got the placebo first and then the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Others got the mushroom first and then the
placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or microdosing mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some of them were told if it was
the placebo or the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And others were not told, were not
informed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it correlated stronger to the
information than to the mushroom itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the people thought it was the
mushroom, they felt an effect way more
[SPEAKER_03]: than people that were not informed and
consumed the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an interesting study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, it's one you will be able to
find your reference that can claim that
[SPEAKER_03]: microdosing works.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's unlikely to, it's still
not conclusive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you could send us the link to that
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to include it in the notes here
for anyone who's curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will dig it out after this interview.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to the different forms that
these products can come into, so you as a
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher or you as someone who's
analyzing these different products,
[SPEAKER_00]: are there unique challenges to the
different ways that these can be produced?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean with how they can be
produced?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so if it's a synthesized versus a
grown part, if that is a problem for us
[SPEAKER_03]: analyzing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we even get there, there is the
problem of analyzing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So quick summary, chemical analysis works
by you are getting your compound of
[SPEAKER_03]: interest into solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this solution is injected into
the instrument for psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: As for cannabinoids, it's an HPLC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So liquid chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the HPLC, high pressure liquid
chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea is that you let your compound of
interest flow along a tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: So flow, it's in a liquid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flows along a tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: That tube is packed with a solid phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you beforehand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Poroshell C18.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically it's a packing material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the compound of interest sticks
to the packing material, but it also
[SPEAKER_03]: sticks to the solvent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's the ratio between stickiness
to the packing material, the solid phase,
[SPEAKER_03]: where there's the mobile phase,
the liquid, ensures it comes along,
[SPEAKER_03]: flows along the column, comes out the
other end and is detected by your
[SPEAKER_03]: detector, which is often an optical
detector.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you compare the time of the
signal you see versus the time the
[SPEAKER_03]: compound that it should be is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's the same time, then the area
of the signal is your concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just did the first two years of
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to get further.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know this all from from cannabis
chemistry and from cannabis analytics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see cannabis laboratory switching
over or adding psychedelic testing,
[SPEAKER_03]: psilocybin testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just way one main problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabinoids THC are fat soluble and
they're not water soluble.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the methods are optimized that
fatty compounds come out like after five
[SPEAKER_03]: to 10 minutes and all the super polo
things like sugar, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: would come out very quickly at like a half
a minute psilocybin is extremely water
[SPEAKER_03]: soluble and not felt fat soluble at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the instrumentation you have,
all these solid phases in your columns,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have, have your psilocybin wash out
with your injection solvent peak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it takes, it takes less than a second
to get your signal out.
[SPEAKER_03]: With with the injection signal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it like it runs through your column so
quick that you have no way of like
[SPEAKER_03]: separating it, measuring it, really
analyzing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to switch to different column
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use HILIC, which is a normal phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fat compounds come out first and
the water soluble compounds come out last.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the HILIC column we use.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then in addition, psilocybin is a
molecule that is normally present as a
[SPEAKER_03]: zwitter ion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the psilocybin has two groups on its
molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: One likes to be positively charged and the
other one likes to be negatively charged.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they can actually exchange proton
so that they can be both charges at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time in the same molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you add a little bit of acid,
then the molecule will overall be
[SPEAKER_03]: positively charged.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you add a little bit of base,
then it's overall negatively charged.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just around neutral conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your molecule can come out in three
different ionic states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neutral as a zwitter ion, positive or
negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does that in most of the cases of
the standard analytical methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really screws up any analytic
peak.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think about an analytical peak
being like this beautifully shaped peak,
[SPEAKER_03]: standard methods you pull out of the
literature will give you like a camel
[SPEAKER_03]: hump.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't work with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then so summarizing a year of our
analytical work here, you can make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's just one peak.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then that peak, then you're using so
strong acid conditions that actually some
[SPEAKER_03]: of your psilocybin is already
dephosphorylated to psilocin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're testing something else or you're
using just the right liquids.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then these liquids break your machine
and you can run your machine for like a
[SPEAKER_03]: day and then you have to repair it for a
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd run a day and a repair
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have done that a few iterations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So finding the right analytical method to
have something robust reliable and that
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't break your machine all the time is
really complicated because this molecule
[SPEAKER_03]: is so fidgety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wants to be in different states.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at it weirdly,
it breaks down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about the breakdown, we get milled
mushrooms from most of the suppliers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we find, the suppliers have used
a mill that ran a little hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they actually dephosphorylated
psilocybin to psilocin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously that's maybe not what they
want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is the analytics which are
complicated already show you the way
[SPEAKER_03]: towards problems in production or issues
in production you have to think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I even go about psilocybin and
psilocin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one do we want?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want one or the other?
[SPEAKER_03]: For everyone who is used to the cannabis
world, you know about THC acid being
[SPEAKER_03]: produced by the plant and THC is what
actually gets you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to convert it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's similar in psilocybin that the
mushroom produces psilocybin, but the
[SPEAKER_03]: dephosphorylated psilocin is actually the
active drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: So psilocybin is the pro drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the conversion happens in your
stomach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the stomach acid is strong enough to
dephosphorylate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could say, oh, let's do it like in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make THC slash psilocin and just give
psilocin to the patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the product they actually want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if milling dephosphorylates already,
why is so bad?
[SPEAKER_03]: So psilocin is really unstable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it likes to oxidize.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It degrades.
[SPEAKER_03]: It disappears.
[SPEAKER_03]: So psilocybin, the pro drug is actually
the more stable one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that you can store somewhat longer.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot to unpack there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what I understand, if I were a
cannabis lab looking to get into doing
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin testing, it's not as easy as
just running the mushrooms through what
[SPEAKER_00]: you already have there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably gonna have to have a
dedicated instrument for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: no?
[SPEAKER_03]: The instrument itself, no, but you need to
change the column.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that comes a different solvent
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so flushing out, so turning from the
THC method to your psilocybin method will
[SPEAKER_03]: take you like half an hour, hour of
flushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like clean the machine in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that can be an impediment to
throughput.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although the big ticket items you already
have, it's just the standard operating
[SPEAKER_03]: procedures, the handling, the methods that
have to be updated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not changing cannabis to hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different beast you have to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and it seems like the material itself
is very sensitive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would think that even preparing that
sample, you could inadvertently be
[SPEAKER_00]: converting psilocybin to psilocin or
changing that polarity of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine that has to be considered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a side note, if you mill a mushroom in
your cannabis lab or your cannabis will
[SPEAKER_03]: then start failing for fungal
contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to consider that aspect too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, us on the medicinal genomic side,
we make microbial detection assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at some of these
regulations that are coming out,
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of have to remind some of these
regulators that you don't want to be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: total yeast and mold testing on your
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get a failure every
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although we have gotten moldy psychedelic
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a mushroom with a different mushroom on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in that case, then two ducking of
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, we got to do species
specific testing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to make sure that,
you know, whatever mold is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing on that, it isn't pathogenic or is
it, you know, detrimental in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that in mind, and maybe that's a
good segue here that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to actually testing for the
active compound, the psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_00]: are there other potential contaminants or
potentially dangerous compounds that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be coming along for the ride?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that there's a lot of
different strains of mushrooms and they
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a lot of different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not careful, they could be
harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you had any experience testing for
anything like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So twofold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do synthetic compounds first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So synthetic compounds might have unwanted
impurities in them, solvents, heavy metals
[SPEAKER_03]: from a previous catalytic step.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are often of issue, but generally
single compound materials are easy to
[SPEAKER_03]: purify and isolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So less of a concern.
Mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while Canada has a legal framework to
produce and give them to patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: they haven't yet really built the whole
production framework, legal set up of how
[SPEAKER_03]: to do this at scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like small scale, patient
focused, not yet anywhere close to what
[SPEAKER_03]: we're used to from the cannabis world with
regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So producers come to us and it's like,
okay, we want this, this, this,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this, and this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, where did you get the idea
from?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, we just looked at
cannabis regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, okay, so the yeast and mold is
really hard and please don't let us play
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they are like pesticides and the
guidelines are for green leaf weed and not
[SPEAKER_03]: for mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure how applicable the
pesticide guidelines are in any way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that said, we are already used to that
cannabis and hemp is a bioaccumulator of
[SPEAKER_03]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same goes for mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm from Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was born shortly after Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wouldn't eat, we're like in,
in central to Eastern Europe, you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: eat mushrooms from the forest for decades
because they were, they came with flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't glow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so you don't want that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so bioaccumulation of heavy metals
might be an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pesticides, we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them, all of them are grown
indoors on a control condition anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then what about wild growing mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually grow here in the BC forests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we can pick psychedelic mushrooms in
the forest near the library.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the university maybe, but the problem
there is wild grown mushrooms or mushrooms
[SPEAKER_03]: that were not grown under health Canada
license cannot be used in my laboratory
[SPEAKER_03]: because my license doesn't allow that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only work with material that came
from licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are currently waiting for our
dealer's license, not to produce anything,
[SPEAKER_03]: but to be able to go field testing with
that license.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can accept material from non-licensed
sources, like patients that want their
[SPEAKER_03]: mushroom tested, like a secondary test,
or I can go into the forest and start
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at mushrooms, find the
psychedelics and then find the ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: look like psychedelics might, might have
toxins on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about our methods of how to
quantify psilocybin, but that's only the
[SPEAKER_03]: start.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also want to know what else is in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normal analytics work by, you know what
you're looking for, you build your method,
[SPEAKER_03]: you look for it, you say yes or no,
and then how much, but it gets more
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting when you start looking for
compounds that you didn't expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first version is called targeted
analysis and we are actually more
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in untargeted analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a beefed up HPLC that's a
little bit too expensive for my own liking
[SPEAKER_03]: and for any normal testing laboratory
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an LC QTOF.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can run samples through it,
see everything that's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we ran mushrooms through it and we see
thousands of compounds, thousands of
compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can't go by hand and say like,
I take this one and this one and I know
[SPEAKER_03]: what that one is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That just doesn't work with the number of
compounds you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are libraries, but then we're
looking at psychedelic mushrooms that
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't really been studied.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have library hits for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually developed an artificial
intelligence that uses like, it's actually
[SPEAKER_03]: based on language, language processing to
identify similar compounds and like family
[SPEAKER_03]: trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can now follow tryptamines,
so psilocybin is a tryptamine,
[SPEAKER_03]: can follow them along and find new
tryptamines, find related compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might get a hit of something that's
related to a toxin in a different
[SPEAKER_03]: mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can now identify those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is a really interesting field of
study, but it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you thought getting a good peak of
psilocybin through a column is hard,
[SPEAKER_03]: doing that for thousands of compounds gets
a bit more complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are in the early phases of going
through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But our first look on a mushroom,
when you look at the table, there are
[SPEAKER_03]: seven tryptamines known and you're an
eighth, you can assume exists just because
[SPEAKER_03]: of structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we found 14 things that look like
tryptamines in a psychedelic mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're like, okay, what is going on
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that becomes interesting and will grow
with size on volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: The volume of mushrooms we get in
different cultivars, different strains
[SPEAKER_03]: will help us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will have a lot of fun in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does Health Canada sort of limit the
types of strains that licensed growers can
[SPEAKER_00]: work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that, for example,
here in the States, in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're specifically limiting the program
to psilocybin cubensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a similar thing going on in
Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Oregon, that's when you have regulators
writing rules without fully understanding
[SPEAKER_03]: what they're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That never happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, they're always perfectly
informed and know every detail of it and
[SPEAKER_03]: can foresee every future permutation of
what the rule will lead to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in Canada, that is not the case,
to my understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've talked to growers and they have
gone through 60, 100 different strains of
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms and trying to find the right
ones they want to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't see that as an issue here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we can still grow a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what the Canadian authorities are very
interested in is the concentration of
[SPEAKER_03]: psilocybin and psilocin and other
psychedelic compounds in those mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they need to be given to a quite exact
number because they don't judge you by how
[SPEAKER_03]: many mushrooms you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: They judge you by the weight of psilocybin
you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your licensing is based on the value
of material you can have on site.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when your mushroom is too potent,
you might bust your allowance in that
[SPEAKER_03]: particular safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are interesting rules one has to
stick to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's interesting that you're
starting to analyze what additional
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds are in these mushrooms,
because we have to imagine that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be other compounds of interest,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was talking with David Meary out
at CanMed, and he was kind of saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin is to mushrooms pretty much
what THC is to cannabis, that it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: just the starting point, and there could
be any number of additional compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: might have benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm a big fan of David Meary's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he comes more from the biological
side, and I come more from the chemistry
[SPEAKER_03]: side, and we meet in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he has all the glowing and amazing
work published where I'm just aspiring to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, yes, psilocybin is the THC of
mushrooms, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the starting point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the banner molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's so much more to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me, compounds of interest,
if it's a compound, I'm interested in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything is a compound of interest to
me, but I'm a chemist.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably define compound of interest
as medically effective or some medical
[SPEAKER_03]: response, some medical value to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, we are still not there on the
cannabis side, even.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are over 100 cannabinoids,
but you can't tell me all the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: aspects that each minor cannabinoid does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So psilocybin mushrooms produce more than
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other tryptamines.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other architectures of interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are even some sugars that are known
specifically to mushrooms and not seen
[SPEAKER_03]: anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And carbohydrates, sugars, can have
biological properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sure, there's a lot to unpack.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my job is to just make sure that I
draw the right molecule and give you the
[SPEAKER_03]: right concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you do with it, that's where the
biologists and medics come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winding down here, because I do want to
be mindful of your time, I'm curious,
[SPEAKER_00]: what has been the most surprising thing
you've learned while working with
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin and these psychoactive
mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_03]: How complicated the regulations are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, we have a laboratory that is
licensed by Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are above board.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do everything right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't do fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can walk around the corner in downtown
Vancouver and buy a mushroom, or I pick
[SPEAKER_03]: one in the wild near the library of the
university.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not within the licensing
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to give you an idea, we started
this whole thing of psychedelics summer
[SPEAKER_03]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting the first actual real mushroom
samples into the lab is an 8 to 12 month
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to get the license.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to find someone who wants to work
with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to get the license.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they have to get the license.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there might be some import stuff
because we got some material from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that needs to go through Health
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have questions and then it's
not the right strain or the concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's frustratingly hard to do work with
mushrooms at the current regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: settings.
[SPEAKER_03]: In cannabis, I go to a website.
[SPEAKER_03]: I order stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: My license encompass all that analytical
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I buy a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it on my smoke machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do analysis of how much THC you inhale
based on the humidity profile of the
[SPEAKER_03]: joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get the answers like two days later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a mushroom, getting that answer
takes me eight months.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the most annoying and surprising
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not expect that it's so much harder
than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other surprising part is how
difficult mushroom analytics are.
[SPEAKER_03]: HPLC methods for mushrooms are so much
harder than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even the same magnitude or
universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are so much harder to analyze from
the method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now for the cannabis labs who are
considering getting into psilocybin in
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom testing, are there established
methods out there now that they can use or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to have to figure it out on
their own?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we started the project,
we obviously did a comprehensive
[SPEAKER_03]: literature review.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the UN has a method.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are literature methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: We recreated them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use them on pure psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just know matrix effects that could
be an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just run the method as in the
literature on pure psilocybin or even on
[SPEAKER_03]: reference standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went through dozens of methods and they
all don't work or they're just like
[SPEAKER_03]: okay-ish or give you camel bumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was frustrating how bad the literature
was on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we published one method already.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put this on ChemArchive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good robust method.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually made it work for C18 because
it's like the easiest adaptable method.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're past this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a few generations later and we're
still working.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a cannabis laboratory that
wants to add psilocybin testing,
[SPEAKER_03]: either you're willing to throw a year of
development work at it or we are happy to
[SPEAKER_03]: share.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like reach out, ask us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might be able to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully some people can stand on your
shoulders and they won't have to reinvent
[SPEAKER_00]: the wheel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because we don't do testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't do compliant testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do high throughput testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only focus on method development or
weird analytics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a smoke machine, a robot that
smokes joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have particle sizes, a QTOF.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have all the toys for the weird and
wonderful stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't have the capacity or the skill
to be given a hundred samples and return
[SPEAKER_03]: them within the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good testing laboratories that do
that very, very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll leave it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I said two questions ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my last question, but one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given that you're not doing compliance
testing and that you're doing some more
[SPEAKER_00]: research based, what is the next sort of
project or kind of thing that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it refining those methods or is there
something specific that you're looking at?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we obviously always refine methods,
then obviously refining the method of
[SPEAKER_03]: untargeted analysis and like language AI
to figure out what compounds are in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the next two big focuses, and we are
waiting for the right licensing on this,
[SPEAKER_03]: is extraction research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because extracting a mushroom is
considered production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if I'm extracting half a gram of
mushroom for analytical purposes,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's not just analytics, but I'm
actually interested in the extraction
[SPEAKER_03]: part, then it's production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hence earlier what I'm frustrated about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So extraction of mushrooms for an
industrial scale is an interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: question that I like to work with and help
the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, you can't just use your extraction
method from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do it again, new, similar to
the analytical methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other aspect is product stability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in what form do we have to store
psychedelic compounds in matrix,
[SPEAKER_03]: in pure form, in formulations for patients
that we ensure we are actually giving that
[SPEAKER_03]: material to the patient, even if that is
six months removed from testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two great focus areas and two
potentially great CanMed talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for staying a little over to
answer my questions about psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, one more time before I let you
go, please do share your website,
[SPEAKER_00]: social media, anything so that people can
get in contact with you or keep up with
[SPEAKER_00]: what you guys are working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our website covers it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the links to our other social
media platforms there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we put all our research articles,
presentations and podcasts on that website
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, as well as like all the services
we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's delic.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, deliclabs.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delic comes from psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the spelling labs, the plural
forms of deliclabs.com is our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For real this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us and hope to
do this again soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
