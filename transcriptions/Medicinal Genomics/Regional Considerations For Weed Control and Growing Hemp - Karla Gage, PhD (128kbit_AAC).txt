[SPEAKER_00]: So are there regional considerations here
for weed control in hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some species are not uniformly
distributed across the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain geographies that have
different problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think across most of the Midwestern
cropping region, the Amaranthus species
[SPEAKER_01]: are a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're familiar with Amaranthus seed,
it's basically their plants in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: genus as that food crop that have become
dominant agricultural weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've evolved resistances to
multiple herbicides that have become a
[SPEAKER_01]: critical part of our crop production
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as they evolve very quickly,
we're losing some of the herbicide tools
[SPEAKER_01]: that our farmers have relied upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's something very special about
those weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those Amaranthus weeds are dioecious,
meaning that there are males and there are
[SPEAKER_01]: females, and they have to cross-pollinate
to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the only species in our
system that are what we call driver weeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that are evolving herbicide resistance so
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the genetic exchange between those
plants is, in a sense, driving evolution
[SPEAKER_01]: and genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the plant that we're
introducing into the system, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is our first dioecious plant,
as far as I've worked with, that is a crop
[SPEAKER_01]: species now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does that bring with it other
challenges?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, potentially, right, because hemp is
the original weed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we have in Illinois victory
hemp left over from World War II era that
[SPEAKER_01]: still grows in the ditch banks and
roadsides around agricultural fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it still exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still is persistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another research question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the fields where we're growing hemp for
a crop, you know, we're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage those volunteers as we rotate into
other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how easy is that going to continue to
be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to be able to continue to
manage hemp, which is very susceptible
[SPEAKER_01]: right now to the herbicides that we use?
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you kind of brought up the
ditch weed that is still out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that a weed for all intents and
purposes for if you're growing hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: could that potentially be an issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing floral CBD hemp,
then yes, that is an issue for you and
[SPEAKER_01]: your product quality and potentially for
other crops as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think more importantly, it's
important to consider that as a reservoir
[SPEAKER_01]: for very important genetic traits that
might be useful for future crop
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants have existed for decades
successfully in these areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are tolerant to the environmental
conditions that they're being exposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: and to the ecological interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that shouldn't be dismissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they should be devalued.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in the future, they could
have a very real contribution to future
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
Thank you.
