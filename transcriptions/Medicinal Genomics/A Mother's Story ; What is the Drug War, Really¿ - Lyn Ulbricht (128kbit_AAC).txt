[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Lynn Ulbricht and I'm really
honored to be here with so many qualified
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: My qualification?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Ross Ulbricht's mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that has given me a crash course in
the drug war and what I think it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: My son Ross is a peaceful person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has no history of violence whatsoever
and yet the judge sentenced him to a
[SPEAKER_00]: double life without parole plus 40 years
for all nonviolent charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an example of what's going on in the
war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government wants to cage Ross for life
for creating and allegedly running a
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone who has a website that might
be interesting to the government should
[SPEAKER_00]: take note of the precedent that is being
set here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The precedent is that a website host can
be held criminally liable for activity on
[SPEAKER_00]: his or her site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross is in prison not for selling a
product but for creating a platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: The site was Silk Road.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an Amazon style online marketplace
that operated anonymously on the dark net
[SPEAKER_00]: with Tor and used the cryptocurrency
Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was essentially a free and open market
where vendors and buyers could pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: sell and buy whatever they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: However there were restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The site was based on the principle of
everything being voluntary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the administration restricted things
that created victims such as forbidden
[SPEAKER_00]: were child pornography.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no child pornography.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no stolen goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't hire a hitman on Silk Road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing that created victims.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many legal things sold but also
illegal including a lot of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said allegedly running because Ross
has pled not guilty to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trial was a travesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now being appealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The investigation was riddled with
corruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two corrupt federal agents in
prison right now for their activities on
[SPEAKER_00]: the site and their ability to tamper with
material on the site as well as stealing
[SPEAKER_00]: over a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently since trial the proof has
been found that evidence was tampered
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a whole lot more that you can
read about at FreeRoss.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before Ross was arrested I didn't
really think much about the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really on my radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids didn't have a drug problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hadn't gotten in trouble about drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't really think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden my son was the
poster boy of the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least as it's gone digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was propelled into the crash
course I told you about where I've learned
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking recently with Ross about
the drug war and he made the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you know, no decent person would
wish that destructive drugs like heroin or
[SPEAKER_00]: crystal meth existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble is when you use government
force to fulfill your wishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it compounds the misery involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't even stop drug dealing and drug
use in the prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the drug war has not worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been over 45 years now over a
trillion dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've asked myself, you know,
well if it's such a failure why doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: the government try a new strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't they do something that works?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've come to the conclusion that it's
not such a failure after all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just consider what it's accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make a lot of money,
you want to expand government power and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to intrude, the drug war has
been a resounding success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately in the process countless
lives have been destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A trillion dollars has been wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our constitutional protections have
been terribly weakened.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug war started out by ignoring the
constitution and it's continued on from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the government wanted to prohibit
alcohol use, it passed the 19th amendment,
[SPEAKER_00]: a constitutional amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 13 years later when it realized
it wasn't working because prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: never does, it passed the 21st amendment
to repeal prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the drug war, the government
hasn't bothered with all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've just declared the drug war and
given themselves the authority to wage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the obvious casualties of it is
the erosion of the fourth amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth amendment is the document that
protects our privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this day and age privacy is a huge
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a major part of Ross's appeal
because unconstitutional warrants and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes no warrants were used in his
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his defense isn't the only one saying
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers and EFF, Electronic
[SPEAKER_00]: Frontier Foundation, joined Ross's appeal
to say, yes, these are unconstitutional
[SPEAKER_00]: warrants and should not be allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ross's case isn't unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even begin to calculate the
number of people who had property seized,
[SPEAKER_00]: been searched, with unlawful, improper
warrants, not to mention illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: surveillance, unlawful wiretapping,
raiding homes with SWAT teams on flimsy
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence, sometimes seriously harming
people, and all under the name of the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: war, so it's all okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is basically what happened to
Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government essentially said that
because drugs are involved, they could
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much do whatever they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could ignore his due process rights
and trial or trample on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could keep the jury from knowing
about corrupt investigators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could smear his name with unproven
and uncharged allegations and many more
[SPEAKER_00]: violations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sets a very dangerous precedent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's an entrenched and
generally accepted drug exception in the
[SPEAKER_00]: courts where if drugs are involved,
the Constitution essentially takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: backseat.
[SPEAKER_00]: One lawyer called this the get out of your
constitutional obligations free card for
[SPEAKER_00]: law enforcement and prosecutors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thurgood Marshall in 1989 saw the slippery
slope that the drug war was putting us on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he dissented in a Supreme Court
decision that was a drug testing case that
[SPEAKER_00]: used the drug exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, no, there is no drug
exception to the Constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And principles of law, once bent,
do not snap back easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the result of this overreach
and this bending of the principle of law?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which doesn't only affect drug cases,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once law is bent and damaged, it filters
into all kinds of cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's given the United States the
dubious honor of caging more of its
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens than any nation on the face of
the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the land of the free.
[SPEAKER_00]: As this chart illustrates, the prison
population since the 80s and the drug war
[SPEAKER_00]: has metastasized.
[SPEAKER_00]: 500% is the latest figure I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.2 million people in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 500% increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over half of these people,
well over half, are nonviolent drug
[SPEAKER_00]: offenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main drug involved is marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: has 5% of the world's population and 25%
of its prisoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more people under correctional
supervision in the United States than were
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Gulag Archipelago under Stalin at
its height.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the book, Caging of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the policies that have
reaped this evil and tragic harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandatory minimums, which take judicial
discretion away from judges and
[SPEAKER_00]: sentencing, longer sentences and a spike
in life sentences have all crammed our
[SPEAKER_00]: prisons to overflowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, according to the sentencing project,
life sentences have quintupled.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are five times as many as were in
1984 and the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in seven prisoners are sentenced to
die in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 17,000 of those people that are
serving life sentences like Ross is are
[SPEAKER_00]: nonviolent people who, like Ross,
have never physically harmed or threatened
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, because there's no parole in the
federal system, again since the 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: life means life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ross said to me, he said, Mom,
a life sentence is a death sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a quote from The Atlantic by
federal judge, former federal judge Nancy
[SPEAKER_00]: Gertner, who is now a professor,
a law professor at Harvard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Judge Gertner said that the vast
majority of the sentences she had to
[SPEAKER_00]: impose over the 17 years she served on the
bench were unjustified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she believes Ross's is too,
which is why she joined Ross's appeal,
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging that sentence, as did Drug
Policy Alliance, Law Enforcement Against
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition and Just Leadership USA,
who said the sentence is excessive,
[SPEAKER_00]: barbaric, and unfair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And taxpayers are footing the bill for
housing all of these people for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of money being generated,
more than $80 billion a year on this
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's people who are very
interested in keeping it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, who is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can get a good idea from this
list, the top five anti-marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we have the private prisons where
human beings are inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have lockup quotas that they have to
meet that gives them every incentive to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep those cages full.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can invest in human beings on Wall
Street, even if you're a judge and a
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecutor, by investing in these private
prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like someone to explain to me how
this is not human trafficking or even
[SPEAKER_00]: slavery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the police unions and the
prison guard unions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person wrote, the drug war is not a
war.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a jobs program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mark Victor writes about how he had a
law enforcement officer say to him,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I'm for the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be unemployed without the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FBI data shows that there are more
arrests for marijuana possession than
[SPEAKER_00]: alone, than for all violent crimes
combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, I feel safer, don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm terrified of those pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad they're behind bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, don't worry about the
violent people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's asset forfeiture,
which comes to billions of dollars that
[SPEAKER_00]: the governments in various agencies seizes
from citizens, often unconvicted under the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next on the list are pharmaceutical
corporations and alcohol and beer
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what better way to eliminate the
competition than to keep it illegal?
[SPEAKER_00]: And not on the list, but worth mentioning
are the violent cartels, the violent drug
[SPEAKER_00]: cartels that infest our cities and are
attracted and are able to have the power
[SPEAKER_00]: they do because of the artificially
inflated prices that drugs get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also the banks like HSBC,
who launder billions of dollars in drug
[SPEAKER_00]: money and nobody went to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They paid a fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you measure the human costs,
the drug war is quite successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, there are terrible human
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistics are real people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of them because I can tell you
when you have a loved one in prison,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole family is doing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am going to the prison to visit
Ross, which I do regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten to know the other families
and the children and the children of the
[SPEAKER_00]: real heartbreak.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come so excited and enthusiastic
about seeing their dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have a little T-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just jumping up and down with
enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we get upstairs, they leap into
his arms and they're crawling all over him
[SPEAKER_00]: and sitting in his lap and just clinging
to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after our measly hour,
they're torn away from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very different child going back
down in that elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're crying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're broken hearted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: These children are being hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are 2.9 million of them with an
incarcerated parent in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two thirds of those parents are
nonviolent, mostly drug offenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a terrible ripple effect from
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Judge Gertner said, we know that the sons
and daughters of the people we sentenced
[SPEAKER_00]: are now in trouble with the criminal
justice system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, that's guaranteed inventory for
the people making money off of this drug
[SPEAKER_00]: war and this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of future inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the privilege of speaking in Eastern
Europe about a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I visited the concentration camp
Auschwitz in Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Auschwitz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an incredibly grim and impactful
experience to be there and to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: experience a place where people did this
to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to believe it even happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I overheard a tour guide say to his
group, the lesson here is watch your
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't that long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not implying that where Ross is,
is comparable to Auschwitz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the UN has called it MCC torture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not Auschwitz.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, concentration camps and gulags
were created by governments who claimed
[SPEAKER_00]: they were doing the greater good also and
who were fulfilling wishes with force
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to pay attention to what's
happening here and where we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to end the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a national disgrace and an it's a
crime against humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is my son Ross in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a danger to no one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a lot to contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so many, he's being warehoused.
[SPEAKER_00]: His life is being wasted to no good end,
but a great cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in his case and
learning more, please visit our website,
[SPEAKER_00]: freeross.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're so moved, please help us in this
fight and not just for Ross, but for the
[SPEAKER_00]: precedents that are being set with this
case that will impact all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you care about your constitutional
protections and you're against this drug
[SPEAKER_00]: war, helping us is a good way to help make
a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
