[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, Ed, what inspired you to
create high science specifically about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and why now?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, back in 2018, I had acoustic
neuroma surgery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anybody knows what that is,
that's a tumor in the brain that's
[SPEAKER_02]: connected to your basically everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after surgery, I spent 33 days in the
ICU.
[SPEAKER_02]: And had some issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the medicine I was on, I did not like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also believed when they did the surgery,
I don't know, 10, 12 hours, whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: was, they said it was easier to remove.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more cyst-like than the tumor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that when I found out I had
this problem, I just smoked a lot of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: because I heard it was great for cancer
and tumors and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I smoked a lot of weed and I believe
that's what made it easier to remove.
[SPEAKER_02]: The doctor doesn't think so, but that's
medical versus a cannabis guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had this idea for a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I wanted other people to
understand what cannabis was all about and
[SPEAKER_02]: managed to through a friend, meet the
infamous David McKellop, who's now my
[SPEAKER_02]: partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what I would do without
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we make a great team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he asked me, do you really think we
could do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I do, David.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, who's gonna own the IP?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, you and I, we're not gonna
sell it to a network.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna do everything ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes from the television world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we set out on the road to find the
most incredible OG entrepreneurs in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry from medical genomics
being the top lead scientists in the
[SPEAKER_02]: country and around the world to the little
guy that produces seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to really showcase these
incredible entrepreneurs and the
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible work that they're doing with
this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave all these puzzle pieces to
David.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are getting ready to launch
the show today, the 27th, eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: David took this and built one hell of a
beautiful puzzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is gonna be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only informative, educational,
entertaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And David, tell us a little bit about your
background and what got you involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent most of my life as a television
programmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've headed up programming departments at
National Geographic, Discovery Channel,
[SPEAKER_01]: History, A&E.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran A&E as the general manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've spent most of my life producing
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from Deadliest Catch at
Discovery to Storage Wars, Hawn Stars,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Duck Dynasty at History and A&E.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been doing this most of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I met Ed, I kind of left the
network.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a certain limit to what you can do
in terms of your age and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's time to let the other people come
in and program, but I had a great run and
[SPEAKER_01]: loved what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was looking for my next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Ed approached me, I was skeptical,
to be quite honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it was like, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I allowed to say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That I'm not gonna just sit here and do
some kind of stoner show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not what... I smoked some weed
when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, when I was growing up,
we actually smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never even drank until after college.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I started to meet some of the
people Ed had rounded up in this group,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I started to do some research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suddenly realized, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people's perception of the cannabis
industry is still squarely in this idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: a recreational drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the government and big pharmaceutical
companies all would love to have you think
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we've soon discovered,
where Ed had shown some light and I did
[SPEAKER_01]: some discoveries, is that quite the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, prior to World War II,
cannabis was the go-to treatment for up to
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 different ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also the main treatment for pain
before aspirin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we began to discover that the
relationship of human evolution and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis evolution is tightly bound and
it's somehow gotten lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my theories on why.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it probably is people don't have
patents on it and can try to make a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take this on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a lot of money,
but we had a lot of passion in someone
[SPEAKER_01]: like Ed, and we met some of the people and
the characters in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we worked hard and we all chipped in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: This became a passion for me because I
know how many people can benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most important thing is that there
have been lots of stories about people
[SPEAKER_01]: overdoing it or going into emergency
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because there's no information.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no trusted source of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government doesn't want to tell you
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmaceutical companies don't want to
tell you anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are basically finding out for
themselves how many gummies it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, an uneducated population is not
going to really be able to fully embrace
[SPEAKER_01]: what cannabis can do for the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since no one else is going to do it,
Ed and I decided that we're going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first step in this was to create
the high science TV show, which is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be an anthology series.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this first series is we're following a
family of investors, but our second third,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could be doing something totally
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal here is to educate people at
the same time and have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I kind of got involved in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
Thank you.
