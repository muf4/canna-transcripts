[SPEAKER_00]: that growers seem to struggle with,
but totally east of mold is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did say that we were going to talk
about some of the factors that your team
[SPEAKER_00]: identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the major ones that you
identified that was in this paper was that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant genetics themselves play a huge
role in the TYM levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if you could speak a bit to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it specifically like the physical
structure of the plant and the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: that leads to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there something else going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like does it have something to do with
immunity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a bit of a surprise to us as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sort of glad we really included
like seven or eight different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics or genotypes in the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we were grabbing whatever we
could, whatever was being grown at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't a planned experiment,
but we did find definite differences
[SPEAKER_01]: between the types of cannabis that were
being grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily it's to do with the morphology
and the size of the flower structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the larger the flowers, the bigger the
mass, if you wish, or volume, the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: the yeast and mold in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants that produce very small buds,
smaller buds, many of them, but smaller in
[SPEAKER_01]: size, not as dense, seem to have less of a
yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was definitely this physical
correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, I do think there were
chemical products, chemicals produced in
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower that would be inhibiting yeast
and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that because some of these flowers
were, the yeast and mold was so low that
[SPEAKER_01]: it was almost impossible to explain just
from the fact that the flowers were small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were secreting some kind of a
chemical product, a natural chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: product that was preventing these yeast
and molds from growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we knew what those were, boy,
we'd be off to a really good start from a
[SPEAKER_01]: research perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely that's something that needs to
be looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's something like terpenes
or some of these other volatiles that we
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not THC or CBD,
because all of these were producing THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something else that perhaps isn't on
the radar yet, something that other
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers or breeders may want to look
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly flower structure,
flower size, and the reason the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers seem to have more yeast and mold
is the humidity, the moisture in those
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers is higher by three to four percent
in terms of relative humidity than the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the temperature builds up in the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost a mini greenhouse sitting on a
plant because it traps the solar radiation
[SPEAKER_01]: and it warms up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds warm up two, three degrees higher
than the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that humidity and moisture,
the temperature creates this little
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse that allows these yeast and
molds to build up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing we asked ourselves,
well, if you circulate the air,
[SPEAKER_01]: you turn a fan on close to the plants and
let this air infiltrate through the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, what would happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, the yeast and molds drop by 90
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you can't go out and put a fan next
to every plant, but certainly you increase
[SPEAKER_01]: your airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your air movement, the humidity drops,
the temperature drops, and your flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: have way less yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not impractical.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some greenhouses, you can set up 8 or
10 fans blowing in a certain direction,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that will really reduce the yeast and
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I and I imagine growers too
would be encouraged to hear you say that
[SPEAKER_00]: there could be something more than just
the morphology of the buds that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, because if you think about
it, growers want big, dense flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to have that be associated with higher
TYM, well, that's that's not good news at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the chemicals are discovered,
which they will be eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be very, very useful because
that's a natural way for the plant to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to protect itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, plants don't have an immune system,
but they do secrete many, many chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: in many of these chemicals are known to
inhibit the growth of mold and bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so finding that strain or strains
would be very useful.
