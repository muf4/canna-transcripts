[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head over to canmedevents.com now to learn
all about our CanMed 2021 event that will
[SPEAKER_00]: take place September 29th through October
1st at the Pasadena Convention Center in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pasadena, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be sure to get your tickets today at
the special early bird rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're at canmedevents.com,
be sure to sign up for email alerts to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay up to date with all the news
surrounding this industry-leading event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this episode we have a few
announcements before I introduce this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I'm happy to report we have
officially launched our CanMed Archive
[SPEAKER_00]: page, which includes over 100 CanMed
presentation videos dating back to our
[SPEAKER_00]: first event in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CanMed Archive is a free, searchable
video library covering a range of topics
[SPEAKER_00]: related to cannabis science, medicine,
cultivation, and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to canmedevents.com and click the
banner on the homepage to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, we have gotten a lot of great
feedback and coverage on the healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: provider knowledge, attitudes,
practices related to medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: research study that we are doing along
with the Cannabis Center of Excellence,
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal Genomics, and the UMass
Dartmouth Charlton College of Business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intention of this study is to collect
information from healthcare providers,
[SPEAKER_00]: in both the United States and Canada about
their experiences with medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and their practices, prior education
around the topic, and interest in future
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical education related to medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a healthcare provider,
we hope you will take part in this short
[SPEAKER_00]: 15-minute survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your personal information will not be
collected as part of the study,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one lucky participant will win a free
full conference plus medical practicum
[SPEAKER_00]: pass to CanMed 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the link in the show description
to go directly to the survey, or visit
[SPEAKER_00]: cannocenterofexcellence.org for more
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, if you are a Facebook user and you
have not yet joined our CanMed community
[SPEAKER_00]: group, you are missing out on some great
discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little over 250 members in the
group who share articles, post polls,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask questions related to cannabis
science, medicine, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: safety testing, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way for the community to stay
engaged throughout the year, and a great
[SPEAKER_00]: way to stay up to date with news related
to those topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the link in the show description to
join, or search for CanMed community on
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and now I'd like to introduce this
episode's guest, Dr. Michelle Shuffett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle is an accomplished healthcare
executive, marketing strategist,
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker, and wellness enthusiast with over
20 years of experience, encompassing a
[SPEAKER_00]: unique blend of clinical medicine,
communications, and leadership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of her recent work has been in the
cannabis industry, highlighting the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential health benefits of cannabis and
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: She recently joined Radical Science as a
founding team member and chief growth
[SPEAKER_00]: officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: At its core, Radical is a rebellion
against the status quo of healthcare and
[SPEAKER_00]: research and a movement towards
democratized, personalized medicines that
[SPEAKER_00]: have the potential to deliver well-being
for all future generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can expect with a description like
that, we talk a lot about what Radical is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing to achieve those goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also discuss Michelle's journey from
being a practicing physician to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher, challenges with traditional
clinical research, lack of reliable data
[SPEAKER_00]: on the effectiveness of natural products,
how Radical Science recruits participants
[SPEAKER_00]: and collects data, and ongoing and
upcoming studies Radical Science is
[SPEAKER_00]: conducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Michelle, I would like to thank this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's sponsor, Cannabis Patient Care
Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Patient Care Magazine is an
educational resource for patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical professionals, caregivers,
and advocates on the latest research,
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, and treatment options medical
cannabis provides for a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit CannapatientCare.com to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Dr. Michelle
[SPEAKER_00]: Shuffett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Michelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're very welcome, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are turning clinical research,
the clinical research model on its head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to, I want to talk about
what I mean by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I kind of want to take a step
back and talk about how you got here,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know you began your career as a
practicing MD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you kind of go from being a
practicing MD to where you are today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, kind of reworking the
clinical research model.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a little bit of a story for
sure, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a physician by training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did my medical school program at
University of Kentucky and my residency at
[SPEAKER_01]: UCLA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I practiced a few years and I think I
honestly knew in my heart that I
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately didn't want to practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a bit of soul searching to
figure out how to apply medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I have come to love, into something
that, that fit me better as a,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a human overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I sort of jokingly refer to myself
now as a, as an MD on rogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I stopped, yeah, rogues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I do work for a company
called Radical Science now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, it, it suits me well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I left practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some consulting in the entertainment
industry and you know, my experience of
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 20, 20 plus years or so has,
has really been a blend of, of clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, marketing strategy, education,
and speaking across a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: healthcare industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I started out in pharma and did a lot
of work there in the COPD space and
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately transitioned into medical
education, healthcare advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, for me, that was a great
opportunity to learn more about how to
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver information and really understand
what clinicians were searching for.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to better understand something to
better take care of their patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I moved on from there because I thought
it was really important to explore
[SPEAKER_01]: digital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked for a digital health
marketing and publishing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really introduced me to the world
of wellness as opposed to illness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after, after spending some time there,
that was sort of a, an eye-opening
[SPEAKER_01]: experience for me that it really inspired
me and filled me with passion to do things
[SPEAKER_01]: there that were focused on integrative
practices and wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately when I left there,
I took a little time to myself and I
[SPEAKER_01]: played around a bit with a digital fitness
and wellness platform and ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: stumbled across the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say stumbled because it was actually
a, a really serendipitous experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was at a cocktail party and
chatting with some folks and this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this one woman in particular was asking me
a lot of questions about my background and
[SPEAKER_01]: the work I'd done as a liaison and an
educator and a speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't quite figure out why she
was asking me all these questions because
[SPEAKER_01]: to my knowledge, there wasn't particularly
anyone coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a woman coming to this event
that was involved in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the long story short at
the, at the end of it, she's, she
[SPEAKER_01]: suggested to me that I meet her husband
because she said that I needed to work for
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's how I ultimately got
involved at Columbia care first as a
[SPEAKER_01]: consultant and then moved on to become
their VP of scientific research and
[SPEAKER_01]: communications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently I still consult for them as
well, but that experience really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really shaped a lot of things for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talked about turning research up,
up on its head and, you know, working
[SPEAKER_01]: with, with Columbia care and their chief
scientific officer, Dr. Rosemary Mazanet,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things I learned is how hard it
is to actually accomplish research in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I see you nodding your head and I'm
sure you, you understand and have heard
[SPEAKER_01]: many, many, many times that there's so
much bureaucracy politics is involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and a lot of the rules are quite
archaic and that's so contradictory to
[SPEAKER_01]: what's actually happening in the real
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we know that, we know that
consumers are, are taking in natural
[SPEAKER_01]: products at increasing rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shocking part is they're doing
this without any real solid evidence in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I got, I got more and more
interested in trying to understand why
[SPEAKER_01]: that was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the questions at my speaking
engagements from, from folks in the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience and also from healthcare
practitioners, because let's be honest,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were never trained on the
endocannabinoid system for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those questions were,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I know how much to take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it be medical cannabis or a CBD
containing product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a really great opportunity for
me to explore that, that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the course of the time,
I got to work in a couple of other
[SPEAKER_01]: fabulous platforms and consult for them to
help communities understand natural
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then I think serendipity
happened again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at a website for the
Holistic Research and Education
[SPEAKER_01]: Foundation, which our co-founder,
Paylene Thorogood started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw a photo of a friend of mine that
I did residency with, and she's a
[SPEAKER_01]: pediatric endocrinologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did a little screenshot of her photo
on the advisory board and I, I sent it to
[SPEAKER_01]: her and I'm like, what, what on earth?
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you start looking into cannabis
research?
[SPEAKER_01]: And things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that she lives near
Paylene and they've known each other for
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was advising as a board member in
the insurance space, which is something
[SPEAKER_01]: that she's doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she connected me to Paylene and we had
a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Paylene and Jeff, the other
co-founder, Jeff Chen, shared some ideas
[SPEAKER_01]: with me about what they wanted to do with
radical science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it hit all the right buttons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got me really excited and very
passionate about being part of a company
[SPEAKER_01]: that the entire mission is around
uncovering the data around these natural
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines and really empowering consumers
and also creating a source of data and
[SPEAKER_01]: insights for a variety of stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think all those things have finally
come together in a beautiful way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's quite the journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it stood out to me that you've started
sort of in the pharmaceutical industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: now you're in cannabis, which I mean,
a lot of people would probably consider
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite ends of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing that you brought up
was sort of this whole idea of wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: versus illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder, is there a connection there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is pharma more sort of concerned
with the illness and cannabis and natural
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines more with the wellness?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you are spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's two sides of the same coin in some
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the pharmaceutical
industry is very necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Western medicine is very important in
many, many cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've all used it to our advantage to
help us over our lifetimes in many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think any of us would trade
that for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it comes about is to solve
problems, to figure out how to address a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular illness specifically,
traditionally speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm generalizing, but I think it's a fair
generalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you think about natural
medicines, they've always been much more
[SPEAKER_01]: geared towards achieving balance and
promoting wellness and optimizing health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been happening for centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also used to manage illnesses as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the crux of radical is built
on this idea of what if you could use a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people quite frankly, just prefer a
natural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if he could use it and be confident
that it's been tested, that we understand
[SPEAKER_01]: how it works and we understand how to use
it and that you could trust it in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: way that you would trust a pharmaceutical
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're certainly not out to squash any
of the work that the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: industry has done.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're trying to do is create a path
and a way forward for natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a zero sum game.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's room for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's coincidental that you bring up
this whole idea of providing consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: with some sort of way to trust that a
certain product is going to work and that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just reading an article about a
probiotic that's supposed to help with
[SPEAKER_00]: athletic performance, specifically with
endurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm training for road races and things
that are eventually coming back online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was curious in that and I was sort
of trying to find information on this type
[SPEAKER_00]: of product and wasn't really able to find
very much of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a good segue into what
you folks are doing at Radical Science to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to get that data and talk a bit about
what your approach is for sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting data around these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fundamentally speaking, Radical Science
is all about validating natural medicines
[SPEAKER_01]: for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was born out of the idea that there
has to be a better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our goal is to create a movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that movement would be going towards a
democratized personal medicine system
[SPEAKER_01]: where we have the potential to share
information and deliver well-being,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will, to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do that by disrupting the
traditional approach to clinical medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do that by disrupting clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can kind of think of us in some
ways as a hybrid of a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the reach of a market research
company, but we combine that with rigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's of utmost importance to us that
everything we do is grounded in science
[SPEAKER_01]: and is incredibly rigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can compare that to perhaps a
research university.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then last but not least, we're a
health tech company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also incorporate agility into our
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're doing is studying natural
medicines in a similar fashion to the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that pharmaceutical products are studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a great group of advisors and
scientific experts combined with the
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge that our co-founders have
accumulated over the past few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our co-founders are Jeff Chen and Palin
Thorogood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they built this company around all of
these ideas after getting really
[SPEAKER_01]: frustrated with the current model in their
respective areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jeff, I think you might know and have
met a few times before, but he started up
[SPEAKER_01]: the UCLA Cannabis Research Institute and
stumbled up against all those challenges
[SPEAKER_01]: that we talked about before with
bureaucracy and being able to do something
[SPEAKER_01]: in a timely fashion, a cost-effective
fashion, things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Palin started a foundation called the
Holistic Research and Education
[SPEAKER_01]: Foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's raising money basically to help
fund these research projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, kept coming up against all
these blocks that made it much more
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult than it needed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two of them came together and came
up with an approach with the goal of
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing the cost and time of research
while still providing rigorous health
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that probiotic you mentioned,
if we were working with that company and
[SPEAKER_01]: able to study it, we would be able to
provide potentially real-world evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: that would help you understand as a man of
your age with your goals, what might be
[SPEAKER_01]: the right dose to help you, what might be
the right time of day to take it,
[SPEAKER_01]: other areas that it might improve your
overall wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would all depend on how that particular
study was designed, but we would be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide that information for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be able to kind of provide almost
some personalized information based off of
[SPEAKER_00]: demographics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the personalized aspects of it,
I think is something that we're very
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about as well, because the
individuals that participate in our
[SPEAKER_01]: studies, they're just as important as a
customer, as the folks that are the brands
[SPEAKER_01]: or the customers that are paying for the
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to make sure that they're
provided with value because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: providing the research community with
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every participant in our studies gets
their own data back in a personalized
[SPEAKER_01]: insights report.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will help them understand how their
data looks amongst the aggregate or the
[SPEAKER_01]: cohort in that study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get a sense of, oh, wow,
the folks that we're taking, and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously making up an example here,
but the folks that were taking 25
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of CBD had the best
improvements in a sleep score.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only been taking 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I should talk with my healthcare
provider, or maybe I'm going to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: choice myself to try a product with a
higher dose and see if that actually helps
[SPEAKER_01]: me sleep a bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to leverage that power in
numbers and share some true insights back
[SPEAKER_01]: with these individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you say that the individuals are very
important and it definitely sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you recruit the individuals to
participate in these studies?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our model is definitely direct to consumer
from the perspective of what we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: in these virtual clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you'd asked me prior to 2020 how I
felt about that concept, I might say that
[SPEAKER_01]: it could be really challenging because
there's a lot of different things to
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder if people will actually follow
through with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think COVID and the pandemic really
showed us that consumers are very willing
[SPEAKER_01]: and able to do things virtually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really helped prove out that model
for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we recruit participants for our
studies, there's a couple of different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways we can approach it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it is based on the trial design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it is based on what our brand is
actually able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some brands are better set up than others
from a customer list perspective or
[SPEAKER_01]: recruitment perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we bring in our participants through
either working with a brand and leveraging
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever list they might have from their
existing customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want new participants, people who
haven't tried a product before,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can leverage a consumer research
network that we work with to get new
[SPEAKER_01]: participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately we truly hope that we
create a network effect and the general
[SPEAKER_01]: public will start to know about Radical
and know about what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to want to sign up and
really want to participate to help
[SPEAKER_01]: generate data and grow this body of
evidence, not only for the community as a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole, but also for their own personal
information and learn about themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that last group is a
really interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's definitely a lot of
people out there who would be very
[SPEAKER_00]: interested to try these new products and
get a personalized report based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there any way that people can sort
of sign up to know about what studies are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up and maybe take part?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have our website up and running and
there's a couple of different places
[SPEAKER_01]: within the website that you can sign up to
be alerted about future opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The website is radicalscience.com and
radical is spelled R-A-D-I-C-L-E.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit of a play on words.
[SPEAKER_01]: The radical is the first part of a plant
root that emerges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the seed of the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we intentionally created that play on
words because it aligns with the concept
[SPEAKER_01]: of natural medicines and plant science and
plant medicine, but also the fact that the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea and what we're doing is a bit
disruptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned that there are different
types of studies that you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that include sort of like open label
or double blind placebo controlled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you meant?
[SPEAKER_01]: In some ways, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing right now are a couple of
different study types, one of which is
[SPEAKER_01]: real world evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that particularly in the CBD
area, that the FDA has really been asking
[SPEAKER_01]: for real world evidence from
manufacturers, from different brands
[SPEAKER_01]: because there aren't many randomized
controlled trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So real world evidence is an observational
approach, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also can do some studies that we call
discovery studies that will allow brands a
[SPEAKER_01]: safe environment to look at different
formulations, look at different products,
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to figure out which one is most
effective and in what combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can imagine, think about all the
CBD products out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of folks are combining in other
APIs, active pharmaceutical ingredients,
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe you're just not quite sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that need to be in a two to one
ratio, a one to one ratio, something else
[SPEAKER_01]: altogether?
[SPEAKER_01]: Full spectrum versus broad spectrum,
lots of different types of formulations
[SPEAKER_01]: and combinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to bring one to market,
you want to be able to test it,
[SPEAKER_01]: understand which one is most effective,
and save yourself the time and effort of
[SPEAKER_01]: putting something out there that may or
may not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can help in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then last but not least, and this goes
back to the idea of validation,
[SPEAKER_01]: is we can do those placebo controlled
trials which will validate the natural
[SPEAKER_01]: product and actually allow folks to be
able to make structure function claims,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is something that's really important
and not done often in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are the results from these studies
made public?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our core values is transparency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we make sure that the studies that we
do, particularly those validation studies
[SPEAKER_01]: and such, are going to be published.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real world evidence studies,
most of those will result in aggregate
[SPEAKER_01]: data publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're working on a really interesting
multi-brand CBD study right now that will
[SPEAKER_01]: launch in June, which will be published in
a peer-reviewed journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going through all the things we
need to do to make sure that happens and
[SPEAKER_01]: abiding by all the regulations,
clinicaltrials.gov, IRB submissions,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the check boxes, if you will,
you have to fill in order to get something
[SPEAKER_01]: into a peer-reviewed journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to ask you about that,
particularly clinicaltrials.gov.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke with Deb Kimlis on a previous
podcast in her groups working on a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: on a CBD tablet for chronic pain that we
discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, we were talking about what
are some ways that consumers can,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, look for red flags or have a
way to kind of validate some of the claims
[SPEAKER_00]: that some manufacturers make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of her suggestions was to check
clinicaltrials.gov to look for the real
[SPEAKER_00]: robust clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad to see you guys are on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I doubted it, but I'm glad to see
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to see that that advice is sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The consumer is in a bit of a double
quandary, in my opinion, because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unlike other areas, there aren't
necessarily as many clinicians as you
[SPEAKER_01]: might imagine that are familiar with CBD
and natural products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of self-learning and a
lot of sorting through very complex
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see something on a website that
says clinically proven, you often take
[SPEAKER_01]: that for face value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you dig in and actually look to
see what really happened, you don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: if that's a valid statement or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our goal as an organization is to
ensure that if someone hears that radical
[SPEAKER_01]: study to product, that you know that that
was done with the highest level of rigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a compliance process that we ask
brands to go through, where we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: minimal set of standards that were
established by one of our collaborative
[SPEAKER_01]: partners, the Label Project, in order to
make sure that they're doing all the right
[SPEAKER_01]: things from a manufacturing perspective
and a labeling perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could talk a bit
about what studies you've done to date and
[SPEAKER_00]: or what other ones you have planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you've recently announced a
sleep study that launched in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if you could speak a bit to
that and other studies that you have going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Radical is fairly new.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company kicked off last fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really excited about the fact
that we have a good bit of data getting
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the, I think, first things will be
released the first week or two of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with a CPG brand to compare
eight different CBD formulations head to
[SPEAKER_01]: head and over 1,000 women.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we feel that's even more important
because women's health is often overlooked
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this information helped the brand
determine which product to bring to
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're releasing a white paper with
details of that analysis in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also been working with two different
CBD brands on real world evidence studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been really working with them to
help them understand their existing
[SPEAKER_01]: customer base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of the cases where they
targeted their existing customers to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how they were using the
products and what experiences they were
[SPEAKER_01]: having.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're perceived health outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have the study that I
mentioned earlier, the multi-brand study,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will be kicking off in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called ACES, Radical ACES,
Advancing CBD Education and Science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the first multi-brand
observational study on CBD efficacy that
[SPEAKER_01]: covers anxiety, sleep, pain, and general
wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to our knowledge, it's the largest and
most comprehensive longitudinal study ever
[SPEAKER_01]: conducted to examine the efficacy,
if you will, of hemp-derived CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really excited to say that we
have, as of today, I think we're up to 14
[SPEAKER_01]: brands that are participating,
many of which are quite familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe the top three brands in the
US are participating in the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be able to share their names once
we announce the kickoff of the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple other things that are going on
right now are the sleep study you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, which launched in April.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a really great partnership
because the brand is truly passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about research and science.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really want to understand how their
product is helping their customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were able to partner with a
variety of different other sleep-related
[SPEAKER_01]: products to raise awareness about the
availability of the study and get folks
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're essentially looking at
different validated sleep indices over the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of a 30-day study period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had ultimately about 200
participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The study's still ongoing, so I can't tell
you exactly how many are going to end up
[SPEAKER_01]: completing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the original goal was to get 200
completers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe the last patient out will be
middle of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be data coming out from that
study a couple of weeks after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a real-world evidence study,
the brand is committed to sharing the
[SPEAKER_01]: findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Radical will take their lead on
sharing the findings as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be some interesting stuff to
help us understand why they're using CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's their primary motivation,
what are they consuming, when are they
[SPEAKER_01]: using it, and how are they actually
experiencing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do they think about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're pretty excited about that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we talked about it
earlier, but I believe when I was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at your website, that the way that the
participants get the data to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's through an app on their mobile phone,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's through a website interface.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're reaching out to the participants in
the studies either via email or text
[SPEAKER_01]: alerts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you sign up, part of the study
process is choosing how you'd like to be
[SPEAKER_01]: communicated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working through both options.
[SPEAKER_01]: The study platform itself is part of our
proprietary approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are learning new things every day
and evolving it to make it better with
[SPEAKER_01]: each study we kick off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I was curious, especially
with a study about sleep, that I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: certain wearable devices that are pretty
popular, like Apple Watch, Fitbit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and others, they have sort of a sleep trap
tracking capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was curious if any of that data
would be valuable to a study looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would absolutely be valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular study doesn't include it,
but that is definitely on our list for the
[SPEAKER_01]: future to make sure that we incorporate
other technologies and other potential
[SPEAKER_01]: data gathering collaborations in order to
build that body of evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the more information you get and
the more you can connect and correlate
[SPEAKER_01]: what someone is saying and how they're
answering those questions with actual data
[SPEAKER_01]: from one of those devices that tracks,
it's gonna be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I would imagine that is a
bit of a challenge with some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: studies, is it's self-reported data,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The questionnaires we use, these are
validated questionnaires though,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're the same questionnaires that
are used in standard clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we start to release the insights
in the data and we talk about certain
[SPEAKER_01]: indices and certain questionnaires,
it's the same thing being used by academic
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think they'll get pretty excited
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a how are you today kind of
a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winding down here, I did wanna touch on
a couple relevant news topics that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out that I was curious how that might
affect what you're doing there at Radical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first being that the FDA is talking
about approving it as a food supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: How will that sort of affect what you guys
are doing there at Radical?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We touched on this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit earlier, CBD is such a
regulatory conundrum, for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_01]: word.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farm bill makes temp-derived CBD
legal, yet the fact that the molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: itself is an approved drug, Epidiolex from
GW, means that it's technically not a food
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's this very, very confusing gray
area and getting it approved or getting it
[SPEAKER_01]: named as a food supplement, if you will,
is I think a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to introduce a regulatory
framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to introduce structure and what
we're doing now sets the stage for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I firmly believe that a lot of the
information we're providing is ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be required information once CBD is
designated a food supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and how would that be different from
other supplements or other natural
[SPEAKER_00]: products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they sort of operating in that gray
area as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're not because if they're
deemed a supplement, there's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific rules and regulations,
whether it be manufacturing, claims,
[SPEAKER_01]: data, things like that, that they're
subject to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas CBD itself right now is not
subject to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's subject to those since it's not a
food supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it, got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other news item is this expansion
of, is essentially expanding the types of
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations that can do research into
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that's gonna open up a whole
number of possibilities for different
[SPEAKER_00]: trials, no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one I'm actually super excited about,
given my work at Columbia Care previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically been a monopoly up until
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since the late 60s, there's only been
one DEA approved source of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say cannabis in this sense,
I'm referring to THC containing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: hot products, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that product came from the University
of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the product that was being provided,
most researchers and most healthcare
[SPEAKER_01]: practitioners felt that it wasn't
representative of what's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: available in the market now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of folks have been really
leading the charge and pushing to get
[SPEAKER_01]: these research, how many is the word,
licenses, open up so that they're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide medical cannabis products or
cannabis products for these research
[SPEAKER_01]: studies such that there's more diversity
in what you can use in the studies and
[SPEAKER_01]: that the products are actually more
aligned with what folks use on a
[SPEAKER_01]: day-to-day basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it has to do with the percentage
of THC in the cannabis that was available
[SPEAKER_01]: for research versus the percentage that
folks are buying when they go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary and get medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really the first chance to use
real-world cannabis in studies and provide
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for more scientists and more
researchers to be able to actually do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sue Sisley in Arizona has been leading
this charge for years and has very
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully, I believe, received one of
these licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty exciting to hear that
amongst a few other folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they've released the full
list.
[SPEAKER_01]: This news is hot off the presses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it came out about a week or so
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be great to see the full list and
understand when these changes can start to
[SPEAKER_01]: be implemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, not being part of an academic
institution at Radical, we haven't been
[SPEAKER_01]: held to the same types of rules that
academic institutions might be held to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But opening it up in general, all tides
rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will make the process a bit easier for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't started doing cannabis studies
yet, but we will be doing those later this
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with you that the more sites
that we have exploring cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting through or breaking down some of
the restrictions that have been put on
[SPEAKER_00]: this, then it's great for everyone,
and especially us at CanMed, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: love to showcase all the great work that
everyone's doing in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winding down here, I did want to give
you an opportunity before I let you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: plug any websites or social media that
you'd like to make people aware of that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can connect with you or stay up to
date with anything that Radical is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our website up and running,
radicalscience.com,
[SPEAKER_01]: R-A-D-I-C-L-E-S-C-I-E-N-C-E, Radical
Science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have a bit of a presence on
LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll expand into social channels later
this year as we start to have data and
[SPEAKER_01]: insights to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best way to know what we're doing
is to go to the website and fill out a
[SPEAKER_01]: form on the contact us page or sign up for
our newsletters, which will start going
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again, Michelle, for coming
on and talking about all the work that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing and all the research that's
going into CBD and natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have talked for a few more hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to all my questions,
but I know you're busy, and I'll let you
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, I get to see you out at
CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, we will submit some data for
you and we can share some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: information with your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
