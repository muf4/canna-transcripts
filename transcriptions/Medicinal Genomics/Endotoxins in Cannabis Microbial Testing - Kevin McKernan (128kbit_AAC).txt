[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be talking about a bit of
a tragedy and a controversy today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I need to first figure out how to work
this remote.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went down this rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very interesting rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be playing a role in a fatality we
had in the state of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever something is complicated and
tragic as that happens, I think it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: important for us to just get all of our
conflicts on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people in this audience know that
Medicinal Genomics and CanMed are the same
[SPEAKER_02]: organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why that's jumping ahead on
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe somebody can go back one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mainly for the folks on camera here,
if this is recorded, that's not always
[SPEAKER_02]: known that the CanMed team is part of the
Medicinal Genomics team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do a wonderful job running our
marketing and making this event happen
[SPEAKER_02]: every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this event is managed on a break-even
basis, in that we try to break even every
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sometimes fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we fail, the Medicinal Genomics
marketing budget picks up the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have a lot of sponsors as a result
of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done this seven years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been sponsored by many,
many parties in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to assure you that this
presentation, none of these sponsors
[SPEAKER_02]: actually played a role in what I'm going
to present.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am going to be sending you some
quantitative PCR data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do make quantitative PCR kits that
we're using to try to shed a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more light on this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so what are endotoxins, and why do we
care?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we think this is still a very
hypothetical level here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think these may have played a role in
this person's asthmatic attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put out a preprint describing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you a bit of a background on
what endotoxins are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is an area that we effectively
have not looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been looking at cannabis safety
testing since 2011.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one's really brought this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were looking at mycotoxins,
which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not looking at all the mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we probably should be looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Sumir Poonja and others have
pointed out there's a lot of fusarium and
[SPEAKER_02]: penicillium on the species which make
mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those aren't being looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: But endotoxin is something that has gone
overlooked, largely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's quite ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only found on gram-negative bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really a molecule,
a lipopolysaccharide, that embeds inside
[SPEAKER_02]: of a cell membrane and has an inner core,
an outer core, and an oantigen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many of you may be familiar with
serotyping, particularly particular
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that serotyping is based on
antibodies that bind to the difference in
[SPEAKER_02]: the length of these oantigens.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, these are highly inflammatory
molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot have these in any injectable
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they can give you anaphylaxis and
have you drop on the spot after a vaccine,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, if they're in a vaccine at
too high of a level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So injectable products are highly
scrutinized to be below one endotoxin unit
[SPEAKER_02]: per particular dose or weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is also the standard, we'll touch on
a little bit later, for airborne
[SPEAKER_02]: endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of that is tolerable?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that is based on the fact
that these molecules are known to induce
[SPEAKER_02]: asthma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there have been some studies of how
much gram-negative bacteria is actually on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a great study from Brett Green
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's coming up with the estimate
around 40% of the bacteria on cannabis are
[SPEAKER_02]: gram-negative and potentially endotoxin
producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the first that we saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shocked us a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we asked our bioinformatics team can
you go and dig into our database and see
[SPEAKER_02]: if this holds up?
[SPEAKER_02]: So at Medicinal Genomics, most of our
clients now who do sequence genomes have
[SPEAKER_02]: been switching from doing exome capture
sequencing to just doing whole genome
[SPEAKER_02]: sequencing because it's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you do whole genome sequencing,
you get the whole microbiome with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a two for one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've now done this in close to 1,000
samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have microbiomes from flower,
from root, from leaf, from stem,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a whole bunch that are unknown because
some people just send us in DNA and we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't always know the source.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with this data, we can dig into the
data and sort of ask a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what is the prevalence of certain
microbes on cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you do some sequencing like this,
here's an example of some DNA from roots
[SPEAKER_02]: that Samir Poonjo sent in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, we got about 11% of the
reads are microbiome reads and 89% are
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually with roots, around 10% to 20% of
the reads come back as a microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get to the stems, it's more like
10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get to the flowers, it's more
like 5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get to the leaves, it's more like
1%.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very little microbiome on the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe powdery mildew samples would be a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't sequenced many of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, you can get a good
profile of what is on these plants by just
[SPEAKER_02]: doing whole genome sequencing and looking
what comes through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you do this and you go through
these 959 whole genomes, you can see that
[SPEAKER_02]: the predominant species on cannabis across
all jurisdictions is pseudomonas,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is in fact gram-negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacillus is next in line, which is
gram-positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, gram-positives are very interesting,
particularly bacillus because many people
[SPEAKER_02]: use those as biocontrol agents that can
push aspergillus out of the plant and can
[SPEAKER_02]: even in some cases push the gram-negatives
out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those who are making these types of
biocontrol agents, I'm hoping this
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation will encourage you to get rid
of the gram-negatives and use the
[SPEAKER_02]: gram-positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this would lower potentially the
endotoxin numbers that are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see by the numbers on the
right-hand side here that yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are a large number of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, perhaps 60% of the samples
have pseudomonas in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are gram-negative bacteria quite
frequently found even in the sequencing
[SPEAKER_02]: data that we find here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the reasons why these in fact may
differ a little bit is because we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: whole genome sequencing and other studies
may have looked at what can culture out of
[SPEAKER_02]: these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we will get different results.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will sequence everything, but not
everything will culture to the same rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't expect them to be exactly the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so here's the fatality that
occurred.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a 27-year-old employee,
Lorna McMurray, who was in a trimming
[SPEAKER_02]: facility in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had an asthmatic attack on the job and
sadly suffered fatal consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone was confused by this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she clearly has been around the plant
before, was not suffering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: What made this fatal event occur?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, a lot of pitchforks came out in the
industry about the employer and not having
[SPEAKER_02]: masks and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I've kind of tried to neutrally
look at this, I encourage everyone to put
[SPEAKER_02]: the pitchforks down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to solve this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to get objective about this and sober
about this, I think we should put all the
[SPEAKER_02]: finger pointing away.
[SPEAKER_02]: The employer instantly put a new HVAC
before any regulation came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any regulation came in place or any
regulator showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you dig into PPE OSHA and NIOSH
standards, that was the right call.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do not know what the hazard is,
you can't mask your way out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people were accusing the
employer of not having enough masks,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the masks frankly don't work for a
hazard that you don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the CDC did pay visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came in and tested for all types of
airborne hazards, but we took note that
[SPEAKER_02]: they looked at endotoxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not something the cannabis
industry usually looks for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was very intriguing to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And OSHA got involved as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why is HVAC the right play here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Megan Mansell has a great book on
all the mask madness that happened during
[SPEAKER_02]: the pandemic and how these masks really
weren't fit for purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a NIOSH and an OSHA expert that does
PPE.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the real takeaway from this is
they have a logic tree there of a
[SPEAKER_02]: hierarchy of controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're not certain what the
actual environmental hazard is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you cannot PPE your way out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start with elimination at the top of
this tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You try to get rid of or clean the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't try to put porous masks on
people's face that aren't sealed because
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't know what's gonna get through
those masks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So HVAC is the right way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: HVAC was not easy to do at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This occurred during the pandemic and no
one could get HVAC during the pandemic
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was backlogged for many
hospitals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so there is now an MMWR at the CDC
on this fatal occupational hazard in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CDC has helicoptered in and written up
this report.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now an important aspect of this report is
that they, now when they went into this
[SPEAKER_02]: grow after the HVAC was put in and
measured it there, the endotoxin levels
[SPEAKER_02]: were safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were below the decost limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was probably because they put in
new HVAC.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not get to sample this during the
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know what was happening while
the patient was suffering.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they did note that when they have
looked at this in other grows,
[SPEAKER_02]: 40% of the employees are exposed to
endotoxin levels that exceed these decost
[SPEAKER_02]: limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so this is a hazard in a
trimming environment that I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone in the industry was really paying
attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were paying attention to patients and
not really thinking about, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: what about people in trimming environments
that are getting large amounts of this
[SPEAKER_02]: dust?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why we care in this case is there's lots
of literature from the tobacco industry
[SPEAKER_02]: showing these endotoxin exposures are in a
risk for asthmatics.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had asthma, so this is something that
could have triggered her asthmatic
[SPEAKER_02]: reaction to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems to make a lot more sense than
perhaps total yeast and mold or other
[SPEAKER_02]: things, because we know in Massachusetts
those grows were regulated to at least
[SPEAKER_02]: produce cannabis that was below a
particular yeast and mold threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would make a little bit more sense
to look at the things that we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: testing for when we're trying to assess
what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The decost limits come out of the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are 90 endotoxin units per cubic
meter of air.
[SPEAKER_02]: A cubic meter of air is a big space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to think of that as being about a
million mls or maybe a million grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna show you some data of
endotoxin levels on cannabis that are
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of times higher than this,
which is a little bit shocking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: These can also be a concern for people who
are not asthmatics, which is paper on the
[SPEAKER_02]: left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, I think might be getting cut off a
little bit on my picture here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll show you what types of clinical
implications these endotoxins can have
[SPEAKER_02]: from an inhalation standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is not the first time this has
been seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: James Couch has been looking at these
types of occupational exposures in other
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cultivation and processing
facilities, and endotoxins have been
[SPEAKER_02]: brought up in both of these papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a NIOSH review there and another
review of a hemp processing facility in
[SPEAKER_02]: Minnesota where they were detecting very
high levels of endotoxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is beginning to build a little
momentum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided we would go purchase a
$6,000 fluorometer from Thermo and run
[SPEAKER_02]: their endotoxin test on some cannabis
samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is using a Lal assay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an assay that uses an enzyme
that's harvested out of horseshoe crab
[SPEAKER_02]: blood, and it clots whenever there's
endotoxin, and it measures that clotting
[SPEAKER_02]: reaction with fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's a standard curve that you
have to run with this, and you will notice
[SPEAKER_02]: if you take a gram of sample of cannabis,
put it in 10 mls of water, and then put
[SPEAKER_02]: just five microliters of that into this
machine, you will be off-curve high on
[SPEAKER_02]: their standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put a half a microliter in,
you'll be off-curve high on the standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get all the way down to like
50 nm to 5 nm to actually be in range on
[SPEAKER_02]: this machine, which is telling us that
this cannabis samples are in the thousands
[SPEAKER_02]: to hundreds of thousands of endotoxin
units per gram, which is remarkably high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so high that I really want to
encourage the industry to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: double-check this technology, maybe with
mass SPAC or something else, because if
[SPEAKER_02]: you go through the endotoxin literature,
these Lal assays are very temperamental
[SPEAKER_02]: based on the matrix that they're applied
in, and you do have to run this in matrix.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to dilute your sample and do
lots of standard curves and dilutions to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that the matrix isn't inhibiting
your actual endotoxin reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just started very simply.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went and grabbed a hemp sample,
a pre-roll in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not required to do microbial
testing, as you can see, and then you go
[SPEAKER_02]: to the dispensary pre-roll, and you can
see that they are required to do microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put this on 3M plates,
you get night and day differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, these samples had equivalent
endotoxin units.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also ran TAC, QPCR, and you can see
very similar effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those not familiar with 3M,
lots of blue dots means lots of live
[SPEAKER_02]: colonies.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the dispensary sample,
those colonies have all been zapped,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably irradiated, but we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Massachusetts, there is no requirement
to label any type of remediation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we said, all right, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to expand this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do 12 more samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went and grabbed a bunch of
non-dispensary samples labeled as ND.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are on the right in this bar chart,
and then a bunch of dispensary samples,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are on the left.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue bars that you're looking at there
are the endotoxin units detected off the
[SPEAKER_02]: platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that they're ranging between
maybe 5,000 and 100,000, and as you get
[SPEAKER_02]: more to the non-dispensary samples,
the endotoxin levels get a little higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: They push up to over 100,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a log scale we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the orange and gray lines are
something that we're doing to try to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: surrogate detection system for this with
qPCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: We run quantitative PCR with 16S PCR
primers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are total aerobic count PCR primers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They measure all bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: We measure it two different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: We measure it in the presence of a
nuclease, in the presence without a
[SPEAKER_02]: nuclease, and this gives us a live-dead
estimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the nuclease runs around and chews up
DNA that's outside of a cell, and any DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: that's inside of a cell is protected from
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can get an estimate of total DNA
that's present in the sample, and then DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: that is protected by a cell membrane with
this type of live-dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see in some cases there are,
in fact, the live-dead offset is quite
[SPEAKER_02]: significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the case of the two samples on the
left, we have lots of 16S qPCR signal,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then once we apply a nuclease,
all that stuff disappears, and we get
[SPEAKER_02]: samples that look a lot more like the
plating results.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are samples where the nuclease
doesn't get rid of all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, Ginny Gleros gave a great
presentation last year on this topic with
[SPEAKER_02]: decontamination tools using radiation,
and the radiation does seem to drop the
[SPEAKER_02]: signal, or the CFU counts, almost to the
floor, whereas qPCR sometimes is still
[SPEAKER_02]: there, and some samples you can still
detect it with qPCR, even though it's
[SPEAKER_02]: clearly been killed from a viability
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevertheless, there is some correlation
here between the live-dead PCR signal and
[SPEAKER_02]: the endotoxin levels, but it's not great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like .43.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't really use this as a
replacement for measuring endotoxins yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we aim to try to improve that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We picked up a paper from Bispo that made,
it was a qPCR assay trying to discern
[SPEAKER_02]: gram-positive from gram-negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you recall, the PCR system we were
using before looked at all bacteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe that's confusing the signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should just look at bacteria that's
gram-negative and correlate that with the
[SPEAKER_02]: endotoxin numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we modified this thing to work with our
particular dyes and moved on and started
[SPEAKER_02]: measuring how specific it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you put in a gram-negative sample
into this assay, you'll see the
[SPEAKER_02]: gram-positive signals come out in blue on
FAM, and the gram-negatives come out in
[SPEAKER_02]: Cy5, and we get about a 15-CT offset
between that on something that's known
[SPEAKER_02]: gram-negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put in bacillus, which is
gram-positive, you get the opposite
[SPEAKER_02]: reaction that occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get more blue signal than purple
signal, and it's about a 15-CT offset.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about a 32,000-fold discrimination
between gram-positive and gram-negative
[SPEAKER_02]: with qPCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be good enough to sort this
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started running these dilutions and
endotoxins to get a better estimation of
[SPEAKER_02]: whether qPCR can guide this process or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see many of these LAL assays in
there are bright green to your eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can almost tell which ones are gonna
be off-chart high just by looking at them,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the standard curve is way out there
and back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is the five microliters
all the way down to five nanoliters of
[SPEAKER_02]: serial dilution going into these things,
and you can still see very vivid color
[SPEAKER_02]: changes that are almost breaking the
standard curve there and back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's just a couple examples where
we've done this on sample, here's sample
[SPEAKER_02]: eight and sample five.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see there's clearly a lot more
gram-negative DNA in purple there on
[SPEAKER_02]: sample eight, coming out of the CT around
15, and then you can see that the
[SPEAKER_02]: gram-positive signal is just behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sample five is shifted almost entirely
over so that there's much lower amounts of
[SPEAKER_02]: gram-negative versus gram-positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we look at the endotoxin levels
for these over on the right, there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred-fold difference in endotoxin
between sample five and sample eight,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's pretty close to what we're
seeing in qPCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting about a 58 to 174-fold
offset between gram-positive and
[SPEAKER_02]: gram-negative results there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the correlation here is getting closer
to .6 now, where the qPCR can predict the
[SPEAKER_02]: endotoxin loads to some degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not .9, which is where we wanna try
and push this to, but maybe it's a tool
[SPEAKER_02]: that can help flag samples that might need
further scrutiny for this test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this endotoxin test, since we're
running four different serial dilutions,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's about $10 a well, so it ends up being
like a $40 test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the instrument's very cheap,
the reagents are a little bit expensive
[SPEAKER_02]: and temperamental.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to use them kind of the day you
open them, otherwise they get contaminated
[SPEAKER_02]: with airborne endotoxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, you can see the
endotoxins on the scale there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many samples cracking the
100,000 EUs per ml.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about four orders of
magnitude over the decost limit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this needs to be checked with mass
spec, and it probably needs to be looked
[SPEAKER_02]: at through aerosols, like what happens
with aerosols, like when you burn this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do know that it's autoclave tolerant,
so you can't get rid of it with
[SPEAKER_02]: autoclaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know how much of it's gonna end
up in the smoke, and that's really,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, what needs to be scrutinized
next.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also run these assays with and
without this Grim Reifer tool,
[SPEAKER_02]: this nuclease, that destroys the dead DNA,
and the correlations get a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see on top are the same samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sample seven and sample eight,
and when you add in this nuclease,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the CT curves kind of shift to the
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We begin to quantitate how much more
gram-negative DNA is actually around in
[SPEAKER_02]: the sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's just a chart of five different
samples that came through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think these were PT samples,
AOAC PT samples, that we were taking a
[SPEAKER_02]: look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see these large offsets.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the top one, there's GR means Grim
Reifer, and no Grim Reifer is the no GR,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can see that the CT scores when
you don't use that nuclease are lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those not familiar with PCR,
lower CT scores mean more, and it's a log
[SPEAKER_02]: two scale, so when you see a 10 CT offset,
you're looking at about a thousand-fold
[SPEAKER_02]: difference there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 3.3 CTs for every scale of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see a big shift here between
live-dead, so we can detect which samples
[SPEAKER_02]: are in fact, we believe, are potentially
been put through some type of remediation
[SPEAKER_02]: process by looking at the change in these
signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all the samples show the signature,
which is a sign that some samples in this
[SPEAKER_02]: set of PT standards were decontaminated or
remediated, and some were not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to summarize a little bit here,
the nuclease treatments we think can be
[SPEAKER_02]: very helpful to discriminate between
live-dead and dead, there are high amounts
[SPEAKER_02]: of gram-negative DNA, and these are
correlating, with a correlation of about,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was .62 on that last slide,
between PCR signal and endotoxin load.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also run TAC, our TAC-Q PCR on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've run our coliform PCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've run a variety of other orthogonal
PCRs, I didn't have time to show here,
[SPEAKER_02]: that confirm this DNA is in fact there,
and it's often living, but the challenge
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have is the plating is blind to
these risks of people using remediation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need to think through this,
because if we're not labeling for
[SPEAKER_02]: radiation, asthmatics are going to be
concerned, because there's a temptation
[SPEAKER_02]: for growers to grow dirty and just blast
things when they're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who knows manufacturing,
you want to fix that at the root of the
[SPEAKER_02]: problem, and grow clean and not have to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, we're very blind to this in the
field, is that when people remediate,
[SPEAKER_02]: this remediation, there's no reason to
believe this is removing the endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've got hard evidence it's not
removing the endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just masking a potential risk from
the patients, by being able to run this
[SPEAKER_02]: through a viability assay, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a pre-print here that you can get
more information on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other confounders we have to
think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people throw the accusation at me
that I'm just drumming up fear porn to do
[SPEAKER_02]: more testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't make any money on this LAL test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something we sell or make.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're right in the fact that this is an
infrequent case.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it's very hard for you to be
pitchforking the employer here,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we've never seen this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's looking for endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a complete tragedy, but we don't
really understand why it occurred.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, there's a lot of
cannabis use out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have people dropping from deaths,
from asthma everywhere, at least if they
[SPEAKER_02]: are, they're not reported, or they're not
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happening in the workplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there is endotoxin-loaded material
hitting asthmatics outside of the
[SPEAKER_02]: workplace, and we would never have it
really recorded as a hazardous risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have to put this into context.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other confounders that occurred
during this death.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is during the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a litany of publications out
there showing that the spike protein,
[SPEAKER_02]: both from the virus and from the vaccine,
exacerbate LPS-induced cytokine storms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Google this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find tons of papers on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the cytokine storms in COVID are
an artifact and often manifest themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: in what appears to be sepsis, which is a
condition of a cytokine storm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know the status here of this
patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if they're vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if they were sick or
recently recovered or had long COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all unknowns, but this is
perhaps one of these other confounders
[SPEAKER_02]: that might be making this lightning strike
event more apparent these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to consider that this is
probably not being considered in general,
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout measuring this type of
epidemiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to point out, though,
there are papers showing vaccination can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually drive asthmatic reactions like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were in a state that mandated vaccines
for people over 100 employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were larger than that, and maybe
that's playing a role.
[SPEAKER_02]: The conclusions here, the endotoxin levels
are from this LAL assay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be very specific here because
this does need to be confirmed with
[SPEAKER_02]: alternative methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: From this LAL assay, they are exceeding
the decostlumins by orders of magnitude on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on every sample we've measured so
far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remediation hides this risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no labeling of this type of
remediation, and we probably need it for
[SPEAKER_02]: asthmatics if we want to avoid future
fatalities like this going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are environmental confounders now in
the environment that are interfacing with
[SPEAKER_02]: LPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that wasn't present in
2000, and no one probably could have
[SPEAKER_02]: anticipated and there is a strong amount
of literature out there suggesting maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: the mass specs we have in the cannabis
testing labs can run these types of assays
[SPEAKER_02]: because this would be a great way to
confirm what's going on with thermos
[SPEAKER_02]: assay, is to see if these mass specs come
up with similar quantitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone out there who wants to collaborate
on that with mass spec equipment,
[SPEAKER_02]: this would be something that you could
hopefully run on existing equipment that's
[SPEAKER_02]: already in the cannabis testing pipeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we do need to look at this in
aerosols.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are just measuring what homogenizes off
of a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not know what happens when we burn
this and pull it through as a smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making some leaps here as to what
we're finding on the flower, and if any of
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to make it into the patient
after pyrolytics.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, I will leave it with questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize if I went over.
[SPEAKER_02]: This clock didn't really start on time,
and so I could be late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one more slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I've got to say thank you for all the
people who worked on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, what was your negative
control on this when you were looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: your samples on the LAL assay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thermo kit comes with endotoxin-free
water, and that is an important point
[SPEAKER_02]: because many RO systems don't perfectly
clean it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get very specific water from
thermo and run that through the assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you didn't have a bacterial-free
cannabis sample?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can't find one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask if I could have some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but we did run tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't put that in there, but the
tobacco is loaded with it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was higher on the pipe tobacco than in
the rolled cigarette tobacco, which was
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote up these slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have run flower versus pre-rolled.
[SPEAKER_02]: We initially focused on pre-rolls because
the pre-rolls tend to have a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look through Sherman's data,
there's a much higher fail rate in
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone just throws their junk
into the pre-roll bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: We figured the numbers would be higher
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at some flower hemp that we're
able to get from Oregon, and Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't have ... They have probably the
most lenient testing out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: and those were equivalent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't see a big difference between
pre-rolls and flowers, at least in that
[SPEAKER_02]: circumstance, but tobacco has this as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would see it in pipe tobacco more
because it's cured in a different way than
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sherman's got a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Kevin, I'd like to, if I may,
first of all, thank you very much for your
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent talk on your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to just make a quick comment from
a regulatory viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of states, because you
mentioned in your talk that remediation of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower in killing the gram-negative
bacteria could be a source of endotoxins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are a couple of states that have
much lower, for example, total yeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: mold action levels of 10 to the 3,
which may cause cultivators to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could there be remediation?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Illinois would be a good place to
look because there would be more
[SPEAKER_02]: remediation going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sadly, when we're looking at the
hemp samples that go through no microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: screening versus the ones in Massachusetts
that, through the dispensary system,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're still getting very similar endotoxin
loads.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plating's completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's night and day on the plates,
but I have a feeling that's ... We don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know this, but I'm assuming that someone
is, in fact, decontaminating the samples,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly if they're pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, we get nothing on plating,
and we get endotoxins that are off the
[SPEAKER_02]: chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Good point.
