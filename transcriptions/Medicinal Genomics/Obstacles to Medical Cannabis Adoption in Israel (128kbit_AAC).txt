[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of ignorance about the
cannabis subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient, when we prescribe them or
allow them cannabis, they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, I'm not taking narcotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physicians were afraid to prescribe it
because we don't have enough research,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not that, as you say in English,
you don't teach all the new tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to teach physicians
new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, we have a very
aggressive media and politicians who see
[SPEAKER_00]: this medical path as point of entry to
recreational usage of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a physician, I'm not in that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: My minister also, he was very,
very strict when he gave us his policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do everything for medical treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oppose anything connected with
recreational usage of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are our ministerial instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe our government is thinking that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few more issues which we have
to cope with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like driving with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until now, we don't have a reliable way to
check if somebody is stoned in his car.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do it with blood tests in the
hospital, but he will be very full to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to hospital to be checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another issue of using cannabis
in hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This issue, I believe I solved by deciding
that you kill can use cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitals, but only if the treating
physician agreed in separate rooms with no
[SPEAKER_00]: other people around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing you need to be very
careful if you smoke in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoke detectors, the fire detectors,
go crazy immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more issues we should have to
solve before we will go on, but I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are only beginning to learn about
the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach in a university.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened the first academic course in a
university in Israel about cannabis and in
[SPEAKER_00]: college.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to always remember how grateful we
are to Professor Mishulam because his
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: With more teaching and learning and
research, this is something with very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very interesting future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the problems with the media
and the parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each meeting in the parliament,
it is really not a great pleasure because
[SPEAKER_00]: we have some parliament members that are
really pro-cannabis, and that is perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, but they are pro-recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look upon the medical cannabis as a
point of entry to open the country to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, to all users, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, I am very fond of medical
usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the parliament, they ask me,
what about recreational usage?
[SPEAKER_00]: I answer, and it's a regular answer,
and it's asked over and over again,
[SPEAKER_00]: my answer is, look, I am a physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in charge of the medical problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational usage is not a medical
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a social problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The society must decide to use or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The society did decide about such issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol, alcohol is approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol has side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it, addiction, cancer,
many other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicotine is allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that cannabis will have
less problems than alcohol or nicotine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but once again, it is not a medical
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, they usually press me and
say, look, it is not right that the senior
[SPEAKER_00]: delegate of the Ministry of Health will
sit here and will have no opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, look, I told you about the
advantage or disadvantage, but one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: which I must stress, if we will let it to
be free in the market, and I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: before that some percent of the
psychiatric patients, patients with
[SPEAKER_00]: psychiatric predisposition, we don't allow
them to use cannabis, the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, in the open market, they will
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the price will be hospitalization of
psychiatric patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must decide as legislators if you want
to pay this price or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come to us, to the physicians,
to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a social issue which must be
decided by the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the parliament, by the government,
not by the medical community.
Thank you very much.
