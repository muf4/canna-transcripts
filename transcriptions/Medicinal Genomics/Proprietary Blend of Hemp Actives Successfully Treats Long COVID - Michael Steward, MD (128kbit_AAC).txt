[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Dr. Michael Stewart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike or Dr. Mike, if you want to be
formal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I start today, I need to share some
breaking news that was published yesterday
[SPEAKER_00]: from the AMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have actually found that in several
different chronic disease states,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana patients have a higher
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some of the Western Docs may be a
little bit behind us here, and that is my
[SPEAKER_00]: training as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at any rate, I was board certified in
family practice in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit after the Jurassic
period for some folks in the room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mostly HIV care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing that in residency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that wound up being the focus of
my office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I became experienced in bringing
novel therapies into clinical practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although cannabis is not a novel
therapy, our use of it kind of is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm applying that experience that I
have here into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: My history is I ran with fire rescue for
seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I entered into the field of
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught paramedicine and fire science for
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned a lot of very valuable
information about medicine even before I
[SPEAKER_00]: went to medical school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can remember while I was in medical
school and I had advanced cardiac life
[SPEAKER_00]: support certification that had lapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was still running in the field on
weekends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my physician advisor gave me some very
good advice when I said, what do I do if I
[SPEAKER_00]: come across somebody my certification has
lapsed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at me and he said,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep your patient's best interest
in your heart, I will always back you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I ever find out that you didn't do
something you knew how to do because of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bureaucratic issue, you're in a lot of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that stayed with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any rate, so I have a little bit
different entry into medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we arrive with fire rescue,
a car is down an embankment in a creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's 4 o'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't say, this is inconvenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back later.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people are suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to do something now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was involved in some repurposing of
medications when it came to HIV.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of resistance to that that I'm
understanding much better now than I did
[SPEAKER_00]: back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people were dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed to be bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a lot of interesting care.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ivory tower delay kind of confused me
because that wasn't a part of my training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a lot of HIV patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I was the largest family practice
provider of HIV care in a five state
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that my clients who were using
medicinal marijuana were doing even better
[SPEAKER_00]: than my clients that were not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would think as an early adopter
and a bold person who is a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: renegade, too, that I would have been
using medicinal marijuana back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regretfully, it was a time when Amendment
2 had passed in Colorado, where my office
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the only office advertising as gay
and lesbian friendly in the state of
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, an Amendment 2 allowed
discrimination based on sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My attorney told me not to do medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I listened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at any rate, ultimately, the office
that I called my adult daycare center for
[SPEAKER_00]: my staff really did become a great
institution for folks who had HIV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wound up sitting in multiple
pharmaceutical advisory boards,
[SPEAKER_00]: was involved in some clinical studies,
although I can understand the frustration
[SPEAKER_00]: of most investigators when I said no to
their studies because we're using very
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic medications and do no harm was
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been the medical director for one of
the largest hospices in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of their divisions anyway,
a home health care agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the medical director for a medicinal
marijuana company in California before
[SPEAKER_00]: they went recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a member of the American Academy of
Family Practice, the American Society of
[SPEAKER_00]: Addiction Medicine, and more importantly,
the Society of Cannabis Clinicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if I could physically,
I'd go back to fire and rescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're here to talk about lung
COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a chronic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know that allopathic
medicine sometimes doesn't treat these
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic diseases quite as well as other
practitioners do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are we talking about here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the lingering symptoms from the
COVID infection, typically fatigue,
[SPEAKER_00]: brain fog, shortness of breath,
anxiety, depression, and sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although more than 200 symptoms have been
associated with lung COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now guys start to think about something
else, myalgic encephalomyelitis,
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic fatigue syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any rate, the first patients came out
around 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came in contact with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put on a 10 week podcast for these long
haulers where I talked for about 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes and then we did questions and
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: 28% of COVID patients are expected to
experience lung COVID according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: CDC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 4 million Americans unable to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's according to the Brookings
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just invite you guys to go out into
the service industry and look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little harder to get work done
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of this is people are
feeling poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a $3.7 trillion cost according to
Harvard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's go on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: When COVID began, I was in the process of
actually moving to Denver for my company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I used to live in Palm Springs and
their HIV center was becoming a COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked if I would give them a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I returned to Palm Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still had a place there at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed all the cases of continuing
medical education that I was doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID, the inflammatory markers were all
attenuated by cannabis and or its
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're talking about
cannabis stocks having new and diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was really new or
diverse, but it was like, guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: what about the endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been studying that for about 10 years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sure seemed to me like the
endocannabinoid system was at least
[SPEAKER_00]: involved here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was damaged in the acute COVID
infection, could restoring that or
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting that help with the symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, could we get them to disappear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least attenuate those symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm a hammer and everything
looks like a nail when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask me if you should use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just ask me how.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the human endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a review for most people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still a little gun shy because during
the COVID arena, if I talked about any
[SPEAKER_00]: thing like the endocannabinoid system or
if I can't help with something that might
[SPEAKER_00]: help with COVID, boy, it was censored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that with a conference with
Dustin Sulak, him being censored once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt like I was in good company
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot more receptors in the CB1
and CB2 involved here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really want to point out here
is take a look at the CB1 and the CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have different actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that THC is going to interact
with that CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that CBD also does as a negative
allosteric modulator, but we want a little
[SPEAKER_00]: activity in that CB1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is why we're going to look for
the full complement of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not looking for isolates of it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we'll go into a little more of the
endocannabinoid system on the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are we going to balance the
endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is a three-part system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, Dustin Sulak's lecture
talked a lot here about these receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: which get upregulated when we are cannabis
naive and come in contact with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the receptors that we know
can be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we've got the ligands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the endocannabinoids,
or naturally occurring cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the phyto cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the enzymes that break
them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically for long COVID,
we looked at the nine most common long
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we chose a phyto cannabinoids that we
knew would be balancing to the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I selected medicinal terpenes
that I knew had some medicinal qualities
[SPEAKER_00]: and assumed the flavonoids that went along
with them were consistent with what was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a full blend of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me just see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD to THC ratio here is non-euphoric
or intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was doing HIV care,
I was combining anywhere from really a
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum of three medications, but most of
the time, about 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, I was combining single
molecule medicines together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was chasing side effects all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been accused of creating chemical
chaos because I'm blending chemovars of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis together that have hundreds of
different components in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I maintain I don't create chemical
chaos when I trust Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not blending synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blending isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not taking the plant apart,
isolating it, concentrating it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Frankensteining it back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using concentrations that occur in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I published a paper on the mechanisms
of action on how cannabis and its
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents could attenuate what was
going on with COVID and long COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if you're interested,
this is kind of a scientific-y paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs through the fact that we have a
complex immune system, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system is its master
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outcomes are correlated with cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inflammatory responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can kind of measure these with
pro-inflammatory cytokines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through some of the mechanisms by
which cannabis can be helpful with
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing the binding of the viral spike
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We upregulate a whole bunch of different
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, if you want to go into detail,
we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have time to do it today,
I don't think, unless we have questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We applied what we learned here,
and we produced a product here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take a look on the right-hand
side of the slide here, this is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: list on every one of our products,
just on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know sometimes I'm accused of
telling people how to build a clock when
[SPEAKER_00]: they ask for the time, but I think this is
absolutely necessary on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a barcode, or what do you call
them instead of a barcode now?
[SPEAKER_00]: QR or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, I was born in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, if you scan the code, you'll come
up with our full COA that not only
[SPEAKER_00]: includes the terpenes cannabinoids,
but it's going to go into the safety of
[SPEAKER_00]: our product as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a cleaner product than
what we have, go ahead and buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please, don't believe me, but listen
to me and compare this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everybody here knows that hemp
is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has a lower THC concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a Schedule I license,
and I do want to do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the one person I know who has a
Schedule I license, I don't think I want
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also believe that I can do 90% to
95% of the work that cannabis can do
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinally, and I can do it with low THC
concentration cannabis that meets the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal definition of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of talk about dirty hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people are talking about dirty
hemp, we're really talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: political environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same plant as marijuana,
just different THC concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issues of dirty hemp, in my
opinion, are political, and they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: resolved with integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lack of regulation does occur in the
hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take care of that by being responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also invite folks here in the room
just to think about whether or not there
[SPEAKER_00]: might be a competing industry to the
cannabis industry that is trying to pit
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemp people against the marijuana
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the state of Colorado has out of
state money coming in trying to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any rate, that was the dirty issue,
sorry, and the lack of regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to maintain our products the
way Mother Nature made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, when I start with the cannabis
plant and I keep it as close to the way
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother Nature made it, I'm starting with a
food rather than a poison, although we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that dosage is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the body knows what to do with full
flower cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, the way we can produce things
is a little bit ahead of what other people
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing in the industry right now,
because we do have the ability to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: wet flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use flower, not biomass,
in our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is the terpene
concentrations and their integrity is
[SPEAKER_00]: really important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't get that kind of result with
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although biomass can produce good
medicine, it's not what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I maintain the enzymes in the
terpenes and flavonoids and the integrity
[SPEAKER_00]: of this plant much better by using ambient
pressures and ambient temperatures in the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please, again, don't believe me,
but listen to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our COAs are very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't read them, please reach
out to me and we can guide you through the
[SPEAKER_00]: COAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are a transparent company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product here was designed
specifically for long COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really focusing on those nine
symptoms that WHO was saying were the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common for long COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, botanical fidelity is important to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only using cannabis blends in our
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't use other botanicals in our
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the FDA doesn't like it,
but I see it quite commonly in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see a COA that is really sky
high in terpenes, think maybe it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not using isolates or synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're blending full chemovars together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, the CB1 and CB2 receptors
are both important when it comes to long
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our products do contain small amounts
of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sulek did a beautiful job talking
about low dosing here and ultra low
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have always maintained that the way
cannabis works, I look at it in some ways
[SPEAKER_00]: more like a nutrient than a medication and
sometimes more like a medication than a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're out in a boat for a long,
long time and you don't get any vitamin C,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might develop scurvy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to treat your scurvy,
you can treat it pretty well with low dose
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eat an orange, maybe take 150 milligrams
of vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_00]: That scurvy should go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use vitamin C as an
anti-inflammatory, it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory and I've used it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to use liposomal preparations or
you need to use it IV because bowel
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance can be reached and it's pretty
uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can be used as an
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is kind of the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: At low doses, I really think it balances
our endocannabinoid systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Sulek gave us a beautiful
mechanism of action of that through
[SPEAKER_00]: hormesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at any rate, when we start to use
cannabis as an anti-inflammatory,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-convulsant, anti-cancer agent,
we need to go up higher in the doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even small doses of getting this plant
into people for any reason I think is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took formula C for a test drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to speed up maybe a
little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a really strong signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was out in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our chief revenue officer talked to a
bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found 10 people who'd used it for long
COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: All 10 had a good response from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not scientific information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a couple of these people actually
started crying on the phone because it had
[SPEAKER_00]: helped them so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took that as a very strong signal on
formula C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put together a post-marketing,
because this was already out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: By definition, this is a phase four
clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through full institutional review
board approval up on clinicaltrials.gov.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not go for an investigational new
drug application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in so doing, I forgave the ability to
patent this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our patients are more important than
our patents are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were able to go into a phase
four clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this product is for long COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID hasn't been going on that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we already have a product that has
been produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through a phase four clinical trial,
I think we're moving in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: direction at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a family of business people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had patents on many products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we always went in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm doing, anybody else can do,
I don't see them as doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do believe that it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trial had two parts to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First part of 28 days, either active
product or placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second part, 28 days, everybody goes over
to open label product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: First 28 days, nine out of nine symptoms
improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the study, we had eight out
of nine that had improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two are statistically significant over
baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: No serious adverse events were noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our patient's global impression of
change is really pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go through a little bit of that
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some follow up work being done
at the Bateman Horne Institute in Utah as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a busy slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it shows in the green here where we
reach some statistical significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is over baseline, not over
placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't go into those reasons right now
because I'll be out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the yellow was areas where we reached
clinical significance rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: statistical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the patient global impression of
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't guarantee you people were doing
three times as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guys, this is a really strong signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think it's happening in a really
good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we now?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with early adopters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long COVID is our focus right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love to work with folks that are
passionate about what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put together an advisory board with
people who are passionate about COVID and
[SPEAKER_00]: long COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Michael Stewart, and my CEO's
name is Isaac Foster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are really here to steward and
foster a better understanding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system in cannabinoid
medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very serious here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to work with other people who
are inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can do this cost-effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get off here, but I do wanna say
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of people in particular
who have really impacted my career over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them can't be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Raphael Mishulam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for Dr. Bonnie Goldstein and Dr.
Dustin Sulak, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dee Dee Meery, thank you, thank you,
thank you.
Thank you.
