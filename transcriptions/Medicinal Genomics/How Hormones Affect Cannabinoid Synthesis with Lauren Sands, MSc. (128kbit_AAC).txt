at Safetiva Labs in Westfield,
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works in both the biological and
chemical side of operations, utilizing PCR
[SPEAKER_00]: and chromatography to test cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lauren received her MS in plant science
with a focus in cannabis molecular biology
[SPEAKER_00]: at the University of Connecticut,
where she focused on how hormones affect
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discussed the
process for how cannabis plants create
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, what role hormones play in
the cannabinoid synthase process,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether a hormone treatment could increase
cannabinoid levels, the ethics around
[SPEAKER_00]: treating plants with exogenous hormones,
and how understanding hormones can help
[SPEAKER_00]: guide breeders to create new cannabis
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Lauren, I'd like to thank this trusted
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories in the cannabis industry.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Lauren
[SPEAKER_00]: Sands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Lauren.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm actually really excited to talk
with you today because you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: presenting some pretty important findings
at Canbid 23 this May that could help
[SPEAKER_00]: growers increase cannabinoid synthase in
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I think to really understand
the work that you've done and what this
[SPEAKER_00]: all means, we should really lay some
groundwork for those who maybe aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with how cannabis plants produce
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering if to start,
could you give us a bit of a layman's
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation of how that process works?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabinoids are produced in the
trichomes on the plants, and trichomes are
[SPEAKER_02]: small hairs on the epidermis of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so cannabis plants make six different
types of trichomes, but only three of
[SPEAKER_02]: these are what we're really interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: These three produce resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these three are called capitate
stocked, capitate sessile, and bulbous
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're really interested in the
capitate stock trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are like the mushroom looking ones
that really, that's what we're looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's going to give us the most
cannabinoids, the most rich resin for
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators, growers, anybody using a
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the female plant develops after
switching into the 12-12 vegetative phase,
[SPEAKER_02]: more trichomes are produced and within
them, the cannabinoids and terpenes are
[SPEAKER_02]: produced alongside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these trichomes are like factories for
cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during flowering, here's where we get
a little scientific.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two active enzymatic pathways
working together at the base of this head
[SPEAKER_02]: of the glandular trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So remember, it looks like a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the top, we have the head of the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the base of this trichome head,
there's a rosette of cells and they
[SPEAKER_02]: contain little organelles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in these rosettes, the rosette
cells, the organelles, these pathways are
[SPEAKER_02]: producing the precursors that are needed
for downstream cannabinoid production to,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the end, make THCA, CBDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in these small organelles in the
base of the trichome head, there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: precursor called olivatolic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this olivatolic acid is converted
to CBGA, cannabigerolic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so CBGA, this is a cannabinoid in and
of itself, but it's also a precursor for
[SPEAKER_02]: many cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can use it as a medicinal
benefit, but also you can, the plant uses
[SPEAKER_02]: it to produce THCA and CBDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this process of converting olivatolic
acid to CBGA is completed by an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this enzyme is what I say for my whole
two years of my master's and it's called
[SPEAKER_02]: renal transferase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are just little enzymes in
the trichomes, but there's 10 of them in
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's really two that the
industry is focusing on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one in four, prenal transferase
one and prenal transferase four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this enzyme causes the reaction between
the olivatolic acid I mentioned and
[SPEAKER_02]: another substrate, another gene called
GPC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this other GPC substrate is
actually gears in two directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one direction, it actually makes
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the other direction,
it's used in this reaction to basically
[SPEAKER_02]: combine with olivatolic acid and that
produces CBGA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now we have CBGA in this rosette in
the head of the trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after it's produced, after this prenal
transferase enzyme finishes its reaction,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's basically transported into the top of
the head of the trichome now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a base and then there's the
top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now it's exported and CBGA is the
precursor to our endpoint cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with the help of certain enzymes,
which you've probably heard about,
[SPEAKER_02]: such as THCA synthase, CBDA synthase,
these enzymes are taking CBGA and
[SPEAKER_02]: converting them to what we want THCA,
CBDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And likewise with other cannabinoids such
as CBC, CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's other pathways that are
very, very similar like for THCV,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's just a few different genes and
enzymes working there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these enzymes produce the final acidic
forms of cannabinoids, which are ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: be used by individuals or used by the
plant for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to tie it all back to like,
why is the cannabis plant making
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand all the how, but these
cannabinoids are known to actually be
[SPEAKER_02]: toxic to the cell and in the trichome
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a byproduct of making these
cannabinoids is hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they don't want it in the base of
the cell, it's going to kill the cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they want to export it to the extra
cellular reservoir to get it away from the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all the resin containing the
cannabinoids and terpenes are in the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whenever they break open,
one, you smell the terpenes, you smell the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, but also it's a sticky resin that
can be used to trap insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the terpenes have anti-fungal and
antibacterial properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically it's like a little defense
bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it opens, it can trap insects,
it can protect the plant, it can collect
[SPEAKER_02]: the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, yeah, honestly, that's the why
and how of cannabinoid production in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, the intricate pathways lead to a
defense against herbivory as well as a
[SPEAKER_02]: treat for us humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I jotted down a few notes when you were
talking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do I understand this correct where
it's the same gene that creates CBGA also
[SPEAKER_00]: creates trichomes?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't actually create trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trichomes just grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote down the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the enzyme that actually
produces CBGA doesn't produce terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the enzyme is using a substrate that
it's taking a substrate from this GPPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the GPPs enzyme is the beginning
of the terpene production.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically what CBGA is to THCA,
GPPs is to terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a precursor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're seeing the two pathways combine and
then kind of go off into terpenes or
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this whole process of this whole
pathway of creating cannabinoids that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really kind of the basis of your work
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of the the foundation,
again, for your findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's stop beating around the bush now
that we've laid some groundwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a bit about, you know,
what's the what's the main takeaway of
[SPEAKER_00]: your research here and why we should be
excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's so many different aspects to my
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of aspects before I entered
the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual actually the lab is the Burke
Woodside at UConn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a call out to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did all this research together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started a while ago, basically figuring
out which genes produce which
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, which ones we should be
looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have to go through all of my research
to get to the end of why it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, I'm helping scientists
understand why the plant is making
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, as we'll get into a bit
later, which hormones in the plant are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Decide like basically telling the plant to
make cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the growers are beginning to
understand which genes we want to look at,
[SPEAKER_02]: which will help us determine which
cannabinoids are going to be produced,
[SPEAKER_02]: when they're going to be produced,
whether we're going to increase or
[SPEAKER_02]: decrease it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big thing is that we're figuring out
which genes can downstream make THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have hemp growers, we want to reduce
the amount of THC produced in the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll know what to do with those genes
if they want to reduce the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: hormones going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually down the road, people will get
to gene editing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know GMO in cannabis plants is a big
controversy, but it is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be possible eventually to
genetically modify our plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially knock out genes so they don't
produce THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our lab is really focusing on why the
plant makes THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in reading your abstract in a bit
of the paper in preparation for this and
[SPEAKER_00]: just to learn more about what's going to
be presented at Candidate 23, my main
[SPEAKER_00]: takeaway was it seems like your team has
identified a potential hormone treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: that can increase cannabinoid synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've looked at a bunch of different
hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main hormone I looked at during my
research is salicylic acid, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant defense hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went through and I looked at a
variety of different things throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked at the promoter of this
prenatal transferase 4 enzyme that I
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you don't know what a promoter
is, it's this stretch of DNA right before
[SPEAKER_02]: a gene, which determines if the gene is
going to be activated or repressed or if
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of our genes in our bodies and the
plants are just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something needs to tell them to turn on or
like work less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I looked at the promoters of these
enzymes and I figured out there are
[SPEAKER_02]: certain elements within this promoter that
are responsive to hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically if hormones are released,
they'll activate certain pathways to then
[SPEAKER_02]: trigger a gene to turn on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I found out that this enzyme that
produces CBGA, I found out that it's quite
[SPEAKER_02]: responsive to salicylic acid treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did two studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, I figured out that the promoter can
be activated at high levels following
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment from salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also did full plant studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the promoter studies were just little
gene cloning, tiny studies, but the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: studies were full flowering plants,
a wife hemp cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I also gave the plants a root
drench of containing salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in both cases, we saw the promoter
is activated, which will downstream
[SPEAKER_02]: produce more CBGA and more THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also in the actual plants,
we saw that through QPCR and examining
[SPEAKER_02]: messenger RNA expression, we saw that a
lot of the genes in the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: synthesis pathway were activated at larger
levels than without the treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw like the prenatal transferase
genes were activated at much higher levels
[SPEAKER_02]: after being treated with salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw that the CBGA and THCA synthase
genes were activated large levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really we're seeing that this hormone
can activate these cannabinoid synthesis
[SPEAKER_02]: genes at larger levels than normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've also seen increased cannabinoid
contents in the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of my research goes into why the
genes are activated, not so much can I get
[SPEAKER_02]: more THC out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really want to know like why the
plant's doing what it's doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: not how can I get the most THC out of the
plant, but I know that's what the growers
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically kind of introducing more of
this hormone is like a signal to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to create more CBGA, which then eventually
is going to make it downstream to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: into potentially more cannabinoids,
correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that can be the case with a lot of
hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also saw a large response from one
hormone called cytokinin, which some
[SPEAKER_02]: growers can give to their plants in a
plant called zeotin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically just improves growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that can be the case for that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically anything that's going to
activate this promoter is a really good
[SPEAKER_02]: source to potentially improve your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the stemming points of my research
was from a cannabis forum where I just
[SPEAKER_02]: looked up growers and they're like,
yeah, I've given aspirin to my plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: the active ingredient in aspirin is
salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people have been doing this
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're actually giving their plants
little tablets of aspirin, dissolving it,
[SPEAKER_02]: giving it to the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing improved plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has already been done in like
people's basements and closets.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we just we're just making the research
and publishing it so that it's actually
[SPEAKER_02]: known throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a common thing that we find
like when I'm talking to researchers is
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're sort of they're explaining
the why for some of these little tricks or
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments that you know, these legacy
growers who have been doing it for so long
[SPEAKER_00]: may have already figured out, but maybe
didn't always understand what's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on inside the plant to make that
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really cool to see how,
you know, academia or more, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional science is coming along and,
you know, first of all, confirming what
[SPEAKER_00]: these folks have been seeing anecdotally
and then actually explaining what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a that's, you know,
a really important thing that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great thing that I'm glad that
CanMed can be a part of, that we can sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of be putting this forward.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I do want to come back to this
idea of like, OK, is there potentially a
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone treatment that we might be able to
figure out that, you know, growers can use
[SPEAKER_00]: to increase their cannabinoid production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we there yet or are we still in the
early stages?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd say we're still in the early stages
because you wouldn't really think it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but actually giving your plants hormones
can be like considered like non-organic,
[SPEAKER_02]: excuse me, non-organic, like unethical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because you're changing the natural
composition of the plant, like a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: these growers, they've gotten to where
they are because they care for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want it to do its own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to encourage it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So giving it external, like exogenous
hormones, changing its natural composition
[SPEAKER_02]: is a big maybe no-no from some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in like the big industries,
people would see that and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, yes, let's give all the plants
Southlake acid and other hormones and just
[SPEAKER_02]: like pump the plant as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you can like kind of relate that
to say, like the chicken industry where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're pumping the chickens full.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to get as much out of the
product and they don't care about the
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think we are getting to the point
where we could give the plants hormones,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it has to be done in a really smart
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do a mix of hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: My coworker at UConn was giving the plants
a mix of different hormones and seeing the
[SPEAKER_02]: outcome of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was actually a really good study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like he was mixing like cytokine and
Southlake acid and methyl jasmine and
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing improved plants and cannabinoid
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think in the next few years,
we're getting out these studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some companies are actually patenting
these hormone treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know CT Pharma in Connecticut patented
our labs methyl jasmine application to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants because they saw increased growth
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if it's done in an ethical way,
people care about their plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't give it too much of the
constant, like give it the right
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations of the hormones because too
much will definitely create toxic effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course not too little because then
you won't see anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think it's a good idea moving
forward, especially like not going
[SPEAKER_02]: straight to like these like really
non-organic methods of helping the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the plants already have the
hormones going throughout them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like it's in my mind, I think it's
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's totally fine to like increase
it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like as I was thinking before,
like salicylic acid is produced as a
[SPEAKER_02]: defense mechanism in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't want to like pose a threat to
the plant so that just so it produces more
[SPEAKER_02]: salicylic acid to produce more
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have to do it in the right way of
giving it the salicylic acid, not scaring
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a point of diminishing returns
where you're doing more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and then, you know, I wonder and
you could tell me if I'm off base here,
[SPEAKER_00]: like would there be something like even
further downstream?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like instead of just like giving the
hormone straight to the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there something else that can be
provided maybe like in terms of forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients or whatever that will sort of
naturally raise their levels of these
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones that would kind of more naturally
create what you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of already in the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a lot of what these nutrients and
like help grow, like I'm not a grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know all the products and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of these nutrient products that
they're giving the plants are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: going to increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a lot of the like increased
growth, external administering things to
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants will help increase oxen,
which is a growth hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, in the end, people have like,
they don't have these products and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be like, oh, this directly
increases this hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's going to increase a bunch of
hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates, I mean, hormones work in an
orchestra.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all working together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some repress, some work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, so I think people are
already working on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like giving plants products is going to
change their hormone networks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to increase, decrease it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then kind of going back to what we
were talking about earlier, like with
[SPEAKER_00]: these findings, it's sort of just like
another way that we could measure whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not these products are working,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see an uptick of these certain
hormones that we know that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: help downstream to create more
cannabinoids to be like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might be onto something with this
formulation here because we're seeing this
[SPEAKER_00]: uptick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all comes back to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody's working together in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think hormones are a really good thing
to look at for these cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with how little knowledge is
actually out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a really good place to start
looking at these genes, growers looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: them, like getting more in touch with
their plant, understanding when hormones
[SPEAKER_02]: are produced during flowering,
how to increase or decrease it based on
[SPEAKER_02]: their environment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm thinking that this could
be very useful information for nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: developers to, you know, as part of their
R&D to be looking at whether the hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are raised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one thing that we also kind of when
we were chatting over email before we were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this, one thing that you mentioned
too about these findings is not only could
[SPEAKER_00]: it help, you know, figure out how to
increase cannabinoid content, but maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially decrease as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could kind of speak
to that a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a few points I'll make here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of going back to the promoter talk,
because that's what I studied for two
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's parts of the promoter that will
activate the gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's parts of the promoters that will
repress the gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these hormones, they can,
a lot of them will activate the gene,
[SPEAKER_02]: increase the transcription to make
proteins to make it usable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of them will repress it and not
let the genes work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you find out which hormones are
going to repress, say the THC synthase
[SPEAKER_02]: gene, the phenyltransferase, all these
enzymes, then you can administer these
[SPEAKER_02]: hormones and see a reduction in
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well THC, if you're a hemp grower,
maybe if you're trying to create a strain
[SPEAKER_02]: that just has one cannabinoid,
like CBG dominant strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also there's another part of my
research that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the promoter of this phenyltransferase
enzyme that makes CBG, I was actually able
[SPEAKER_02]: to mutate part of it, which then gets into
the GMO stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's controversial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually mutated the part of it when
we were doing like petri dish stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got rid of the responsive element to
salicylic acid, and then we saw no
[SPEAKER_02]: response to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can mutate these promoters and
then put them back in the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: which they're not able to do yet,
they're still working on actually
[SPEAKER_02]: genetically modifying the cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever they're able to actually do that,
you can take the gene, mutate it,
[SPEAKER_02]: put it back in, then it's no longer
responsive to this hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also other parts of the
promoters that are responsive to other
[SPEAKER_02]: things, like these genes that'll bind and
activate it called transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can also mutate those areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they won't bind anymore,
and so they won't activate the gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of these different methods you can
come up with, gene editing, giving them
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can determine if the plant's going to
make more or less THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, this is really making less
THC is good for the hemp growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making more THC is great for these medical
marijuana cultivations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of different things we
can do and figuring out which enzymes work
[SPEAKER_02]: to make which cannabinoids is really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then that's just the baseline.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go in so many different directions
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we talked about gene editing
and how that's controversial in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: ways too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think also some work that we're kind
of doing on the medicinal genomic side
[SPEAKER_00]: with helping growers sequence their plants
and maybe find interesting novel ways
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, and you correct me if I'm
wrong, if we understand which parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene or which genes are implicated for
these things, we might be able to find
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occurring mutations in some of
these plants and then kind of use more
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional breeding or marker assisted
breeding to sort of get the end result
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think developing the full understanding
of all the gene networks and which genes
[SPEAKER_02]: do what is the best step to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then actually, I know there have been
people breeding some plants to get rid of
[SPEAKER_02]: a THC synthase gene naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's one of the best ways
to go about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know the plants can still make some
THC even if they don't have the THC
[SPEAKER_02]: synthase gene, because the synthase genes
are very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wouldn't get rid of all the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in that case, you're still working to
get rid of some things that you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add in different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think breeding and just understanding
the plants is one of the best ways to go
[SPEAKER_02]: about all this cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Lauren.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winding down here, I did want to give
you an opportunity to plug any social
[SPEAKER_00]: media or any websites or anything that
you're affiliated with or you're posting
[SPEAKER_00]: your work about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just any other resources that you know
about that are sort of in a similar vein
[SPEAKER_00]: to this that would be good for folks to
read up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please let us know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just finished my master's at UConn
and they have one of the best plant
[SPEAKER_02]: science programs ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the best lab with Dr. Jerry
Berkowitz and a few others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to say thank you to them and
go check out our research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been coming up with a lot of new
cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one right in the works,
this paper actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pre-print is posted.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are currently actually publishing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it should be out soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to also shout out to my lab
that I work at in Westfield,
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Safe Teva Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a startup.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've probably been open for like two
months now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are one of the best teams I've ever
met.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do all sorts of testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do really competitive turnaround times
for anybody in the area that wants to test
[SPEAKER_02]: with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do pickups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Safe Teva Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check us out on Instagram, LinkedIn,
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to my lab and UConn lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, thanks to my family and
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will definitely put links to the social
media and the websites in the show notes
[SPEAKER_00]: so people can find it quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I echo your sentiments about the
work that's coming out of UConn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a number of submissions from
folks out of that lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I expect that UConn is going to be
well represented at Can Med 23,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we're really excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again, Lauren, for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to seeing you out at
Marco Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You as well.
