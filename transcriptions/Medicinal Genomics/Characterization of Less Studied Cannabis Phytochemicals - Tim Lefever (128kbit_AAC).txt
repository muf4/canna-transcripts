[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Tim O'Fever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm director of discovery at Nalu Bio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to CanMed for inviting me to give a
talk about some of the investigative
[SPEAKER_00]: research we're conducting on minor rare
cannabinoids in pursuit of both
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceutical or therapeutic development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's obviously a very exciting
time in the cannabinoid space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, certainly there's been no shortage
of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interest in developing
cannabinoid-based health products or
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot we just don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got this surge of interest in
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulations are continuing to evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And research is advancing and coming out
more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still a lot for us to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we believe that the synthetic
pathway offers us an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can synthetically derive
cannabinoids that currently cannot really
[SPEAKER_00]: be extracted from any existing plant
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we propose is developing these
synthetic pathways, investigating them,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting them out on the marketplace,
and kind of establishing the pathway for
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical development down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not saying this is a separate
pathway to botanical development or that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's better in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sort of paving the way to
justify the genetics on the plant-touching
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually towards botanical preparations
that may have better effects, the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sum is greater than any of the
individual cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm just changing the notes on me
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while we're characterizing these
phytocannabinoids for potential
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceutical applications, we can also
leverage the learnings from that data set
[SPEAKER_00]: into the identification of potential
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a high level, we tend to think of
the cannabinoids as a nature-made
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical pipeline that has a solid
promise but needs a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: refinement through medicinal chemistry to
generate a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously as we work on this approach,
we might find a phytocannabinoid that
[SPEAKER_00]: stands up on its own as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've built a computer-aided drug
design platform that's been trained with
[SPEAKER_00]: critical existing information,
and we refine it every time we collect
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we recycle that information back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's constantly getting better and
evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with each cycle, it improves in the
designs it spits out, given the parameters
[SPEAKER_00]: that we set, hopefully generate promising
NCEs that we can follow up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just a high-level
outline of how this commercial and
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic endeavors are connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start again with the cannabinoids on
the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We screen them computationally and then
follow up physically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for those that have limited data,
we'll undertake talks and efficacy studies
[SPEAKER_00]: while optimizing our synthetic approach to
making them and protecting any IP that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of any of that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a phytocannabinoid looks good
through that entire process, we'll pursue
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, now moving to the right,
how the information gathered on the
[SPEAKER_00]: phytocannabinoids can inform our
therapeutic program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that the early drug discovery
cycle is very similar to the
[SPEAKER_00]: phytocannabinoid cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to drive efficiency and
synergy across our platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that as we go farther into
the drug development pathway, the assays
[SPEAKER_00]: start to deviate to be a little bit more
traditional of a drug discovery program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if we get lucky and we identify
a potential hit, we move towards pre-IND
[SPEAKER_00]: enabling work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we continue to revise and
refine our NCEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I just wanted to provide this
context of our program at NALU before we
[SPEAKER_00]: jump into the work that we did for this
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of have an idea and the
rationale for why we did what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this first run through of this
approach, we screened a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some obviously have been more studied than
others to get a sense of how this process
[SPEAKER_00]: might work, tweaks we may need to make in
this approach going forward, the
[SPEAKER_00]: predictive validity of some of our models,
and then just the overall value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so given the massive amount of data
that we've collected and some of which
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show today, I'm just going to try to
focus on CBC, CBGV, CBDV, and Delta
[SPEAKER_00]: 8-THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll present the data from the other
phytochemical models, and we'll touch on
[SPEAKER_00]: some interesting findings here and there,
but we'll focus on those four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as you saw in the approach
above, what we're doing is fairly robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focused on modeling and
high-throughput screening initially to
[SPEAKER_00]: triage early and cheaply, kind of a staple
of a drug discovery approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we evaluated these cannabinoids across
a range of assays and experiments,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting by validating docking models at
several orthosteric and allosteric sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for today, we'll touch on CB1,
MU, and GPR119.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then screened all of these
phytochemicals in ADME and physicochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: assays and some additional models.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at microsomal stability in
human, rat, and mouse cells, MDCK,
[SPEAKER_00]: MDR1 permeability, kinetic and
thermodynamic solubility, finally,
[SPEAKER_00]: log P and log D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we examined the activity of the
cannabinoids across several targets in
[SPEAKER_00]: radio ligand binding assays and functional
assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this overlapped with some of
our docking targets where we wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare the validity of our docking model
as well as get a sense of in vitro
[SPEAKER_00]: activity at some of the other targets we
have not yet modeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, we then conducted
a in vivo C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans study with NEMO life to explore
potential acute and sub-chronic toxicity,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as impact on neuroactive function,
which can be used as an indicator of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurodegeneration or neuroprotection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first up, for the ADME results,
the MDCK, MDR1 permeability assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna go into the weeds of a lot
of how these assays work or their methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so much data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to find me afterwards and we can
get into the nitty gritty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, understanding intestinal
absorption is key for oral products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many different ways to
investigate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the assay we chose for this
first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it simulates drug entering the
bloodstream from the intestine by forming
[SPEAKER_00]: a monolayer and examining the permeation
efficiency from apical to basolateral and
[SPEAKER_00]: vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this model can also be used to
effectively predict the potential for a
[SPEAKER_00]: compound to cross the blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left table with the green
highlighted bars, you can see both isomers
[SPEAKER_00]: of THCV, Delta VIII and Delta IX THCV,
as well as CBDV, were shown to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: most favorable directional permeability,
or the transporter efflux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by extension, these are most likely
to cross the blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I should mention that some of
these compounds weren't very easy to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with in this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back and forth with the CRO and
some of these were going to rerun.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, there's some NAs,
there's some blanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not perfect and we need to keep
working on some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also screened these phytochemicals
through an open web source modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: program called Admet Lab 3.0, which is a
great resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to see how our physical data
aligned with what was predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there are definitely some
discrepancies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, again, CBGV seemed to
score very well in the model, but not in
[SPEAKER_00]: the in vitro assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the model may be able to kind of get
around some of the method development work
[SPEAKER_00]: or the chemical complexities of
cannabinoids in some of these physical
[SPEAKER_00]: assays to get to potentially a more
realistic prediction or score more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we're going to continue to
refine both our in vitro and in silico
[SPEAKER_00]: models to eventually get to the point
where we're confident enough in our
[SPEAKER_00]: predictive validity that we can skip the
physical assays for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, this is human microsomal
stability data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the liver represents the majority
of the P450 metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so understanding microsomal stability
is crucial for understanding the basics of
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism by measuring clearance and in
some cases, identifying the metabolism
[SPEAKER_00]: lights formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This assay is available across a number of
different species, which allows for
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison, as well as metabolism profiles
to be noted when developing early PK
[SPEAKER_00]: studies for drug discovery work.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, most of the cannabinoids are
metabolized pretty quickly, indicating
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid clearance or conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a relatively short half
life, which typically is not a favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: attribute of therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Canflavin A and CBCV both had
better profiles in the human liver
[SPEAKER_00]: microsomes than the other cannabinoids,
potentially indicating better stability
[SPEAKER_00]: and longer half life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see again the difference between
CBC and CBCV here, where the only
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in their structure is just a
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So besides this work, we're also pursuing
structural activity relationships of a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of phytocannabinoids and hope that
we might find some similar predictive
[SPEAKER_00]: abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between the changes in alkyl tail
length and the impact of binding in GPCRs,
[SPEAKER_00]: does that also ring true for, say,
microsomal stability or permeability?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to put this whole story
together and hopefully build up a very
[SPEAKER_00]: big, a very robust predictive platform
where we can screen even more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: phytocannabinoids as well as NCEs we
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing that we're trying to do,
this data just came in, so I wasn't able
[SPEAKER_00]: to add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to identify some of the
metabolites of some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: phytocannabinoids and phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working on adding those into
this modeling as well, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful for a lot of these because they
haven't been reduced to practice yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, they're not available for
purchase to screen in a physical assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you have a high predictive
validity in your model, that's a very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: way to get at some of that data quickly
instead of waiting to synthesize material
[SPEAKER_00]: and then put it into an assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to surprise anybody in
this room, but cannabinoids are not very
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can be a challenge to
formulate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to that end, we wanted to establish
basics both around solubility for
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation effort, product formats,
as well as how these phytocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: perform under physiological conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, CBGV and CBDV were the most
soluble, both in the kinetic and
[SPEAKER_00]: thermodynamic solubility assays and had
the best log P scores, which for
[SPEAKER_00]: lipophilic molecules, as many cannabinoids
are, is a good measure of aqueous
[SPEAKER_00]: solubility and membrane permeability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you recall, CBDV showed decent
permeability and CBGV was predicted to
[SPEAKER_00]: have good permeability but didn't follow
up in the physical assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all of this work with the ADME and
the PCAM is to say that many of these
[SPEAKER_00]: assays are intricately linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you improve one quality,
you see improvement in another.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see deleterious effects in one,
you might see deleterious effects in
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see once again, though,
that there's a lot of potential to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: these molecules towards a more drug-like
molecule or a therapeutic that we can use
[SPEAKER_00]: in our pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on to the docking models, and again,
this is a whole talk in and of itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the work of my colleague Mehdi
Hagdus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not my work, so I'm gonna try my
best to represent it well, but basically
[SPEAKER_00]: he validated these docking models using
cryo-EM of the proteins that were
[SPEAKER_00]: available, and then he trained the models
using as many compounds as available,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then screening false positives to try
to get an understanding of the predictive
[SPEAKER_00]: validity of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: His goal is 70% predictive accuracy,
where we're moving towards 80% as our
[SPEAKER_00]: standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes him about a month to validate
each target at each site, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of certain cryo-EM or crystal
structures or existing data on ligands
[SPEAKER_00]: really kind of dictates which targets,
which sites we can go after in a
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningful way towards having a predictive
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, allosteric binding sites,
ion channels, the availability of data on
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 agonists kind of limit the ability of
some of those models to be more predictive
[SPEAKER_00]: than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, they're all rapidly improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data's increasing every day, so we're very
confident that over the next few years,
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling the activity of phytocannabinoids
and chemicals in general is just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep improving and improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, so this is just kind of an
outline of how we did this for GPR119.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he trained up the model on about 1,800
compounds with known activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to achieve about 74%
predictive accuracy when he re-ran the
[SPEAKER_00]: known GPR119 agonist MBX2982.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we used a very similar approach
for the other targets and sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the CB1 model being the most robust
in our hands, he's been working on that
[SPEAKER_00]: model for about four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one's up to about 84% predictive
accuracy, where we just started adding in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mu orthosteric and allosteric sites,
and so their predictive validity is much
[SPEAKER_00]: lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, every time we collect data and
put it back in, the models improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here you can see the predictive
activity at these different sites and
[SPEAKER_00]: targets based on MEDE's models at each
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the top half of this table,
you can see the scores for the
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lower score indicates predictive,
better activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the bottom half of the graph,
you can see in those highlighted colors
[SPEAKER_00]: that correspond with the target and the
site at the top, kind of controls if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to think of them that way,
or ligands that we know that have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically very strong activity at that
given site or target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get a reference point of where
the phytochemicals fall in line next to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those very strong ligands that we
also modeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to help verify these models,
then what we did is we went out and we
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted some in vitro bioassays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pursued a number of different radio
ligand binding and functional assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tested percentages and sent
inhibition for radio ligand binding assays
[SPEAKER_00]: at CB1 and CB2 against CP55940,
at MU against DAMGO, and at 5HT1A against
[SPEAKER_00]: 8-hydroxy-DPAT.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also then completed dose effect curves
for those four targets in cyclic AMP
[SPEAKER_00]: functional assays to derive IC50s for
agonist and antagonist activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: For TRIP-V1, TRIP-MA, and TRIP-A1,
we used functional calcium flux assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPAR-GAMMA, we used a luciferase
functional assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, across 10 concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But along with the 5HT1A functional data
and radio ligand binding, we didn't see
[SPEAKER_00]: much meaningful activity in any of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't touch on those anymore for the
rest of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I think for a few of the TRIP
subfamilies, we need to go back and look
[SPEAKER_00]: at those individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of these phytos, we are
pretty confident they have some TRIP
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may just have not chosen the right
family and the right subfamily for these
[SPEAKER_00]: assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's the in vitro data we got
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left, you'll see the radio
ligand binding and the percent inhibition
[SPEAKER_00]: for CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the orange and green, the solid bars
are at the 1 micromolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The checkered bars are for the 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see mu in the purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the graph on the right is the
functional cyclic AMP data for those same
[SPEAKER_00]: targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the most part, our results
match what's been previously demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The binding effects were all concentration
dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few things we would want to
point out and we want to follow up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, again, the difference
between the Delta VIII and Delta IX THCV
[SPEAKER_00]: isomers is something we're continuing to
investigate and pursue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may help to explain some of these
differences that we're going to see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: in vivo data in a few slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very interested in continuing to
figure out what the differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: those two isomers may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also plan to explore CBGV a little bit
further as the antagonist activity at CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: is intriguing compared, again,
to the in vivo data that we're about to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we go back and we apply that in
vitro data that we just collected onto
[SPEAKER_00]: what Mehdi's docking model predicted,
you can see that for CB1 on the left,
[SPEAKER_00]: where, as I mentioned, he's been working
on that model for many years, the
[SPEAKER_00]: predictive validity is very high and the
physical data is almost right on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the predicted data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can see on the right,
as I mentioned, is the very new MU docking
[SPEAKER_00]: scores that we just added into our
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the predictive validity
there is much, much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, every time we screen,
we add in, it will get better and better
[SPEAKER_00]: and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So onto the in vivo data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we partnered with NEMA Life to look at
acute and sub-chronic toxicity as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroactivity in C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this model has become increasingly
popular as a method for high throughput in
[SPEAKER_00]: vivo screening as an alternative to
initial work using rodents.
[SPEAKER_00]: C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans, they're a very basic organism,
but they share critical properties or
[SPEAKER_00]: conserved biology that allow for
translational interpretation into mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we were most interested in just
understanding the basic toxicity as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as the neuronal activity effects of these
phytocannabinoids of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the neuroactivity data can be used as
an indicator of potential neuroprotective
[SPEAKER_00]: properties of a test substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, speed and movement of the
C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans or the worms decline as the
organism ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the addition of some compounds
will result in maintenance of this
[SPEAKER_00]: mobility or speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they age, or in the case of some test
substances, will actually increase
[SPEAKER_00]: mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversely, decreases in movement may
indicate neurodegeneration or toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So briefly, worms are loaded into this
microfluidic chip, which is the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: little device there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live in there in a growth medium that
is mixed with the test substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're constantly living in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then each day, the fluid is flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's flushed, it stimulates all
of the worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cameras over each of the chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It records their activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that activity is scored using an
AI system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the results over the course of
the nine-day dosing regimen, really no
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity was observed for any of the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can see in this graph is the
percent lethality on the y-axis and then
[SPEAKER_00]: up all of the doses and all of the
phytocannabinoids along the x.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the percent lethality is cut off
at 8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing really significant
about any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can see some trends, but they're
very, very, very minor effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was very good news for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting to note, however,
that you'll see that CBC the limited
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity that we see is actually going up
as the dose decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not significant, but something we
wanna pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to press play on the video?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this is what the videos look
like and what the AI software scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for the control worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not treated with any compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see baseline movement,
and then you'll see this flash of white
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when the liquid is being
flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the AI then analyzes the activity
of the worms post-flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows for a very easy visual
comparison across the doses and the
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're continuing to mine this massive
data set further to look at speed and
[SPEAKER_00]: distance, change from baseline,
recovery post-stimulus, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also discussing looking at the
actual individual movements of each of the
[SPEAKER_00]: worms themselves that have been correlated
in the past to mammalian behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if they're curving in a very
specific way or looping, those can
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate things like stereotopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you skip to the next slide?
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then activate this video for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, again, is the same thing we just
saw with the control data, except this is
[SPEAKER_00]: worms that were treated with
100-micromolar Delta-8-THCV, which was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most stimulating doses and
phytochemicals we tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at some more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trust me that these guys are moving a
lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look towards the bottom left
going up towards the right, there's one
[SPEAKER_00]: worm that just screams across the entire
frame very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some other worms that also
exhibited that behavior, which we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: drill down into, that seemed to be linked
to Delta-8-THCV more so than any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other compounds we tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little bit easier to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are still images of the paths of all
the worms in red that you can see at the
[SPEAKER_00]: very end of the observation window
post-stimulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can clearly see that the control
and the CBC data are somewhat similar in
[SPEAKER_00]: their overall activity compared to the
increased activity or the density of the
[SPEAKER_00]: red lines that you see with Delta-8-THCV
and caffeine, which is the positive
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the doses here for CBC and
Delta-8-THCV are 100-micromolar and the
[SPEAKER_00]: caffeine is 5-micromolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I just talked briefly about a
couple of the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBC was pretty interesting in this
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effects weren't dose-dependent or
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be that we were off on the
dose range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need to go back and look at it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is interesting to note, though,
that CBC was the only phytocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: that had increasing toxicity as doses went
down, not up, as I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, not significant, but certainly
worth following up as CBC does have some
[SPEAKER_00]: published data indicating that it has some
neuroprotective effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think potentially for CBC we may have
just been too low and we were at a
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The increase in activity we observed with
CBDV, on the other hand, is unsurprising
[SPEAKER_00]: given the nature of previous research with
CBDV and neuroprotection, which may
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate that by increasing the
bioavailability and subsequently
[SPEAKER_00]: permeability of CBDV, relatively low doses
could be advantageous across a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurodegenerative disease states or by
using Med-Chem to modify CBDV to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble and stable while retaining the
activity that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGV, again, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It significantly increased activity at
both 100 and 350 micromolar, though they
[SPEAKER_00]: were fairly equal potent, and then there
was no effect at 40 micromolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data points trend towards a
potential dose effect, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: may need to go back at another dose to
round out the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, CBGV, as we noted earlier,
does have that small trend in the toxicity
[SPEAKER_00]: data, but not significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just fairly interesting that one of
the most stimulating cannabinoids also
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibited some of the toxicity we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBGV, we think it might confer some
neuroprotection through its activity at
[SPEAKER_00]: the trip channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though we need to explore this a little
bit further, as I mentioned, we didn't see
[SPEAKER_00]: any meaningful activity of CBGV at trip
A1, trip V1, or trip M8.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I think we need to go back and
look at a few more of the subfamilies of
[SPEAKER_00]: those ion channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8-THCV had a dose response
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was stronger than any of the other
cannabinoids, and on several days even
[SPEAKER_00]: outperformed the positive control
caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interestingly, only the 350 micromolar
dose of the Delta-9-THCV isomer
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly increased activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw a pretty big difference between
Delta-8 and Delta-9 in this assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we want to continue to explore
the difference between these isomers and
[SPEAKER_00]: hope to better understand what's driving
certain effects over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to sum up the in vivo data,
again, none of the cannabinoids produced
[SPEAKER_00]: any significant signs of toxicity that
we're concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most seem to show increases in
neuroactivity, which may be linked to
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotective effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: While CBC and Canflavin A had some
inhibitory effects, they weren't dose
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent and likely just require some
basic follow-up on the doses we selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to bring this full circle, so in order
to ensure this approach for our overall
[SPEAKER_00]: program works, we used our in-house CAD
system to generate design based on CBC and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBN towards our validated targets and
indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, we've designed over 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reduced 32 to practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of those 32, they have predicted
potential both in docking scores as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as in ADME and P-Chem properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're hoping to do is scale
some of these up, put them into in vivo
[SPEAKER_00]: assays later this year, and then continue
to refine and build our MedChem library.
[SPEAKER_00]: While also building up more
phytocannabinoids in our initial screening
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall summary, the modeled activity was
fairly predictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ADME and the P-Chem is in line with
previously published data for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves lots of room for improvement
towards more drug-like molecules for a
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic endpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the in vivo work, coupled with the in
vitro activity data, shows several leads
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to follow up on and interesting
efficacy studies to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, using our model, we were able
to design CBC and CBN-based scaffolds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are already showing improvements over
those phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry I went over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
