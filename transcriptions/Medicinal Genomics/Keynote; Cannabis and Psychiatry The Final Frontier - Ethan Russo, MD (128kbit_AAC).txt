[SPEAKER_00]: Well, welcome to my coming out party after
26 months doing Zoom meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Cannabis and Psychiatry,
The Final Frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cue sound effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychiatry, The Final Frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the voyages of the Starship
Cannabis, its eternal botanical mission to
[SPEAKER_00]: explore strange new worlds, dimensions,
and recesses of consciousness,
[SPEAKER_00]: to seek out better life and new models of
civilization, to go boldly where no
[SPEAKER_00]: tardigrade, fungal mycelium, sentient
being, nor split infinitive has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of disclaimers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing I'm discussing is FDA approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your results may vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, as a whore of industry,
I have many commercial relationships,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I'm going to tell you is true to
the best of my ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a world of difference between
recreational studies of cannabis wherein
[SPEAKER_00]: the intention is to attain intoxication,
release, or an altered state of
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness as compared to its
therapeutic application wherein the intent
[SPEAKER_00]: is to attain symptom relief at much lower
dosages without adverse events including
[SPEAKER_00]: psychiatric symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: To briefly introduce the endocannabinoid
system, it all began with a plant we call
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that produces the glandular
trichomes and, of course, THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works analogously to the endogenous
cannabinoids, particularly anandamide,
[SPEAKER_00]: both as weak partial agonists at the CB1
receptor, but there are many other
[SPEAKER_00]: components of the system that we'll
discuss in another talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CB1 receptor where anandamide and THC
work is densely packed in the central
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous system, particularly in limbic
areas that subserve emotional function.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is very important in regulating
the release of glutamate and GABA in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, so is neuromodulatory,
especially on mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know about cannabis extends back
at least 4,000 years in written
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, you see a tablet from the
Sumerians in what is now Iraq,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there were various descriptions of
what we believe to be cannabis including
[SPEAKER_00]: this key line, for and against panic,
which is a 4,000-year-old representation
[SPEAKER_00]: of the biphasic dose response curve of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little is anxiolytic, too much is
anxiogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of historical references to
continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the oral tradition in China,
2700 BCE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ma Fen, taking much of it, one may make
one the whole ghost, which is the Chinese
[SPEAKER_00]: term for hallucinations, and frenetically
run about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protracted taking may make one fat,
strong, and never senile, a
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotective effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Atarva Veda in India,
five kingdoms of herbs, headed by Soma,
[SPEAKER_00]: and including Banga, that may release us
from anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Persian in the 18th century,
Maksan Oluwia, it is said that bang is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best of God's gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It quickens the fancy, deepens thought,
and sharpens judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is far from reefer madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, numerous times you'll see slides from
this key page or paper from 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's been additional information
since then, but this is the best review on
[SPEAKER_00]: the subject of medical cannabis and mental
health by Zach Walsh et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna start off with neurocognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does cannabis produce impairment?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that he separates these into
therapeutic use and non-medical use,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as we'll demonstrate, the results are
much milder and surprising in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment that cannabis produces and
whether that remains with the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to review some studies that are
very little known.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were actually sponsored by the
National Institute in Drug Abuse in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s, and after they did several of these
and the results weren't what they wanted,
[SPEAKER_00]: they stopped funding them, and these books
actually disappeared from libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me years to obtain them on the
antiquarian book market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, Jamaica, Ganja in Jamaica,
they looked at 60 men and had them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital to do all kinds of tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were using three spliffs a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd consider this low potency,
but I don't know where they were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: their spliffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was better material available in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those I can attest to personally at the
time, but the key thing for today is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there were no significant differences in
neuropsychological tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The users of cannabis actually had
increased Wechsler adult intelligence
[SPEAKER_00]: scales on the digit span, something you'd
think would be hard to remember if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study from Grace with Hashish
again, moderately low potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these are people that used a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't a lot of
electroencephalographic changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the neuropsych testing, users were
better than controls on the ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: similarities, digit symbol substitution,
and verbal IQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: These observations do not provide evidence
of deterioration of mental abilities in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hashish users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one from Costa Rica, again,
relatively mild quality cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but high volume of usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, enough THC was getting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no immunologic or endocrine
changes on neuropsych.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, quote, we failed to uncover
significant differences between user and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-user groups, even in those subjects
who had consumed cannabis for over 18
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this study from Jamaica, Melanie
Dreher, who became the dean of a nursing
[SPEAKER_00]: school subsequent to this, working men in
ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this study, she showed that the work
capacity for working in the fields in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hot, humid environment was enhanced by
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interestingly, among Rastafarian
women who used high volume of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja, but did not use alcohol,
their children actually were advanced in
[SPEAKER_00]: their neurodevelopment as compared to
control children.
[SPEAKER_00]: A study that our group did in Missoula,
Montana, back in 2001, we took four
[SPEAKER_00]: patients from the Compassionate Use
Investigational New Drug Program that got
[SPEAKER_00]: legal cannabis from the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, relatively low potency by modern
standards, but they were using upwards of
[SPEAKER_00]: nine grams a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the profiles of the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the tests we subject them
to, excuse the 20-year-old technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you see all the neuropsychological
tests that we did, quite an intensive
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those findings, all four patients had
mild difficulty with attention and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they were medicating the whole
time that we were doing this, so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was at least minimal impairment and
acquisition of complex new verbal
[SPEAKER_00]: material, but the important things,
higher level executive functions were
[SPEAKER_00]: totally within normal limits in two of the
four, and none were depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll demonstrate that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the judgment of the
neuropsychologists that there were no
[SPEAKER_00]: attributable sequelae to their cannabis
usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: To follow up in 2018, and these are the
ages, patient A, B, and D had lost access
[SPEAKER_00]: to NIDA cannabis, but patient A continued
daily use from other sources, possibly of
[SPEAKER_00]: higher potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients B and D were reported cognitively
intact, by the nurse on the study,
[SPEAKER_00]: was Mary Lynn Mathery, and I interviewed
patients A and C, and as a neurologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say that they were quite sharp
mentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patient C is an active vice president of
an investment firm, so people rely on him
[SPEAKER_00]: to manage their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pokedal, and this is an older study,
but it's very well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at current and past heavy
users of cannabis with light past users,
[SPEAKER_00]: and got neuropsychological tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some cognitive deficits in the
current heavy users that persisted for a
[SPEAKER_00]: week, but were totally gone by 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quote, our findings do not support the
hypothesis that long-term heavy cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: use causes irreversible changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Igor Grant, who is the chairman of
psychiatry at UC San Diego, did this
[SPEAKER_00]: meta-analysis, and intensively looked at
published studies, and crunched the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quote, the results of our meta-analytic
study failed to reveal a substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: systematic effect of long-term regular
cannabis consumption on the neurocognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: function of users who were not acutely
intoxicated, and then a key finding,
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiating this, quote, recreational
usage from therapeutic usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quote, these findings are not likely to
generalize to more limited administration
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis compounds, as would be seen in
a medical setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, medical patients use less,
and would be less likely to have
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A more recent study with very big numbers,
over 2,000 cannabis users, young age,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, compared to almost 7,000 controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking again at meta-analysis of studies
of neuropsychological function.
[SPEAKER_00]: In studies examining abstinence of greater
than three days, there were no significant
[SPEAKER_00]: difference from abstainers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall effect size was very low in
terms of any reduction of cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: function in frequent or heavy users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, any changes between the groups
were below one third of a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: deviation, meaning from a statistical
standpoint, there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quote, previous studies of cannabis in
youth may have overstated the magnitude
[SPEAKER_00]: and persistence of cognitive deficits
associated with use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reported deficits may reflect residual
effects from acute use or withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, quote, these results do not support a
heightened risk for poor cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes in cannabis using adolescents
compared with adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean it's fine for teenagers to
do multiple bong hits after school instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing sports or studying?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nobody was saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in terms of damage, there's no
evidence for the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: My colleague Kirsten Moody, a fellow at
the University of New York, in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: has studied Tourette syndrome extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were using a pure THC preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there were going to be a problem,
you'd expect it to be related to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they saw no detrimental effects
on neuropsych function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Donald Abrams did a study of
pain and HIV.
[SPEAKER_00]: This required smoking of nine to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the patients had prior experience with
cannabis, and it was helpful in decreasing
[SPEAKER_00]: acute pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem was, smoking isn't the best
way to treat most medical conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the rapid increase in
pharmacokinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you see here, there was 25%
anxiety, 54% sedation, disorientation 16%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the kind of profile that the
FDA is likely ever to approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turning to some studies of Nebiximals or
Sativex, which is an uromucosal spray with
[SPEAKER_00]: equal amounts of THC, CBD, scattered
cannabinoids, and terpenoids, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: study of neuropathic pain in multiple
sclerosis, 66 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no significant difference in
Hamilton anxiety, depression scores,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in neurologic disability scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was improvement in selective
remining portion of the brief repeatable,
[SPEAKER_00]: misspelled, battery of neuropsychological
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this comparison, we looked at long-term
use of Nebiximals, Sativex, as compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke cannabis in the Dutch and Canadian
programs over the long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hot colors are the smoked cannabis,
and the cool colors are Nebiximals.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see, the side effects, including
psychiatric associations, were much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: in smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were both medical populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking at Nebiximals, the
difference between early studies with fast
[SPEAKER_00]: hydration and higher allowance,
they found that more than 12 sprays,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be about 32.4 milligrams of
THC a day, above that, you had more side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects than benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a slower titration with limits were
placed on the studies, you see that
[SPEAKER_00]: dizziness, fatigue, somnolence,
et cetera, were markedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very comprehensive study was done on
post-marketing of Nebiximals by Recand et
[SPEAKER_00]: al.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was done in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at 150 patients in clinical
trials and 900 post-marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doses that were used in practice were
actually lower than in the clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one case of suicidal ideation,
but that person was on placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long-term treatment with THC CBD spray was
not associated with cognitive decline,
[SPEAKER_00]: depression, or significant mood changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at driving, another area of
contention, there was only one small
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in visual pursuit, not
statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that all the other parameters of
driving were improved, and determination
[SPEAKER_00]: was statistically significantly improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: These patients were better drivers after
their treatment of multiple sclerosis with
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebiximals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, neuropsychological testing,
this is the PASAT, the PACE auditory
[SPEAKER_00]: serial addition test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad I got that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No significant difference, placebo or
after treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these patients with multiple sclerosis
spasticity were clearly better the general
[SPEAKER_00]: impression of change by patients,
physicians, and their caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms, one person at 40 had significant
psychiatric side effects, and zero in this
[SPEAKER_00]: cohort had any suicidal ideation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A study in children from Israel,
this was actually done with Delta-80.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was pure, it would be unlike
preparations currently in vogue in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treated eight children with
hematologic malignancies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 400 in total 80 dose
applications with almost total abrogation
[SPEAKER_00]: of the nausea and vomiting associated with
the chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their doses were actually very high
compared to what happens in adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this points out that children under 10
are highly resistant to psychoactive side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe kids are naturally high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a bunch of studies,
observational work from Israel,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this was cannabis and autism,
180 patients mostly taking an oil CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: predominant, but with a decent dose of THC
three times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: After six months, the vast majority were
continuing treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their moods were improved in almost
two-thirds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improved activities of daily living,
good sleep, and concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% were significantly improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an old study of Sativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that in almost every
instance in a variety of different
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, there was improvement in sleep
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost every study of cannabis used
therapeutically will have similar
[SPEAKER_00]: findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at post-traumatic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous research has been done in either
animals or humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work in animals showed extinction of
aversive memories, which are a hallmark of
[SPEAKER_00]: the disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also stress-induced analgesia was found in
animals, demonstrated reduction in pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and blew it, posited the idea of a central
anandamide deficiency predicting
[SPEAKER_00]: stress-induced anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dig into specific studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Walsh's review of the data
available then.
[SPEAKER_00]: A substantial portion of people with PTSD
use cannabis with good outcomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly improving sleep and reducing
nightmares.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the effects of THC is reducing
somewhat rapid eye movement sleep of
[SPEAKER_00]: dreaming and nightmares.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is quite sensible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt Hillen looked at World Trade Center
survivors, compared the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: developed post-traumatic stress to those
who didn't, and also normal controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at anandamide levels that
was a negative relationship between the
[SPEAKER_00]: anandamide levels and intrusive symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They felt that the results showed a good
correlation of lower anandamide levels to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase CB1 receptor binding sites in the
central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, providing evidence for
clinical endocannabinoid deficiency in
[SPEAKER_00]: PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an imaging study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done with positron emission tomography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in post-traumatic stress versus
trauma patients that didn't have PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, healthy controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is complicated, but the CB1 selective
radio ligand showed a higher volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution with lower anandamide tone in
PTSD that was highly statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant over healthy controls and the
trauma experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, exposed controls that didn't have
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went on to suggest that agents
increasing anandamide availability were
[SPEAKER_00]: possible therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would include things like cannabidiol
and cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Walsh had all said about depression,
and there were improvements noted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been allegations of an
association of cannabis use with
[SPEAKER_00]: depression, but no evidence specifically
of causation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is always an important
distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look back at the chronic use
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, four patients, middle to age to
older, who were using many grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: NIDA-supplied cannabis a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had very bad diseases that would make
anyone depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of the four patients had been addicted
to opioids, one intravenous opioids,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: None were taking anything of the kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the Beck Depression
Inventory 2, mild depression is 18,
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate 27, severe 34.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had patient A with a score of seven,
six not depressed, and the other three
[SPEAKER_00]: scores of zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardly at all depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study I wish I'd done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this idea 20 years ago, but no way
to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was struck by the fact that
electroconvulsive treatment, shock
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy, is still effective in intractable
depression where drugs haven't worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does it do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, people's mood improves, number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, when there's too much
treatment, they have short-term memory
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment, usually temporary.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that sound like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought if we could test these
people, their cerebrospinal fluid with
[SPEAKER_00]: spinal taps, lumbar punctures,
we could demonstrate that, but we'd never
[SPEAKER_00]: get it through an institutional review
board, ethics committee, while they were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do it in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they looked at 12 depressed patients
who had cerebrospinal fluid exam before
[SPEAKER_00]: and after electroconvulsive therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ECT increased in nanomide levels
significantly and nearly significantly on
[SPEAKER_00]: the 2-arachidonal glycerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number of treatments correlated
with these kinds of differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their conclusion was that
electroconvulsive therapy modulates the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system to alleviate
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the whales are calling me,
but they'll have to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the issue of psychosis,
everyone knows that too much cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: make people crazy, temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been much more controversial as
to whether you generate de novo cases of
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia related to cannabis usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best evidence is if there's an underlying
susceptibility, it will unmask it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this study done in the United Kingdom,
they looked at 600,000 patient visits that
[SPEAKER_00]: represent 2.3% of the entire population of
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they noted was the incidence and
prevalence of schizophrenia was stable or
[SPEAKER_00]: actually declined somewhat in the 10-year
interval, 96 to 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is keeping in mind that there was
an 18-fold increase in cannabis usage
[SPEAKER_00]: between 1972 and 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, schizophrenia incidence down,
cannabis use up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't seem to indicate a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quote, the most parsimonious explanation
of the results reported here are that the
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia psychosis data presented
here are valid and the causal models
[SPEAKER_00]: linking cannabis with schizophrenia
psychosis are not supported by this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another analysis from England,
they looked at male heavy users of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and looked at the number needed
to prevent a case of schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this ranged from 2,800 to 4,700 people
depending on their age.
[SPEAKER_00]: In females, it was somewhere between five
and 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to stop from using cannabis at
all to prevent a case of schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hardly convincing as an
association.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about therapeutic use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there've been two randomized
controlled trials of pure cannabidiol in
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia, both phase two,
using very high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one by Levica et al in Germany,
800 milligrams of cannabidiol a day
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the atypical antipsychotic
amisulpride in 42 patients over four
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were improvements in positive and
negative syndrome scores in each,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the negative symptoms were notably
better on cannabidiol and there were many
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer side effects on prolactin elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atypical antipsychotics are tough
drugs that produce weight gain,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients don't like them and we have a
real possible alternative here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dosing probably could be a great deal
lower with a more complete whole cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another study from England.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, 1,000 milligrams of pure CBD
divided twice a day over six weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were compared to control patients who
were on standard antipsychotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive psychotic symptoms decreased on
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clinicians' ratings favored CBD over
conventional agents and motor speed also
[SPEAKER_00]: improved on CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about acute craziness, what's called
the toxic psychosis from excesses of THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this, I compared Marinol, which is pure
synthetic THC, which has been known to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause toxic psychosis, paranoia,
delusions in patients with as little as 10
[SPEAKER_00]: or 15 milligrams of pure THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the study by Sellers, we had to give 18
sprays all at once to show that there were
[SPEAKER_00]: no heart rhythm abnormalities and there
were four episodes of toxic psychosis out
[SPEAKER_00]: of 260 exposures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be 48 milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people would never use cannabis
at all, but everyone was fine the next
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the difference that cannabidiol and
terpenoids make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walsh on anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight cross-sectional studies of medical
use, two non-medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the non-medical use, there was a small
positive association between cannabis use
[SPEAKER_00]: and anxiety, but again, no evidence of
causation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of work on cannabidiol was done in
Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was another study with pure CBD and
they were looking at people with social
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety, something a lot of people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: A small study, normal controls and 24 with
social anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some got CBD and some didn't, but they
used 600 milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be an awful expensive proposition
to use regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD pre-treatment before trying to make
them anxious significantly reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety, cognitive impairment and
discomfort in their public speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm speaking today without benefit of CBD
or anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just gotten used to this over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Study of fine gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at cannabis use in people with
anxiety disorders, they started with a
[SPEAKER_00]: large sample of 3723 Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: A small percentage had a diagnosis of
anxiety disorder and were using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly, but there was no significant
difference in anxiety remission rates
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to other users and non-users.
[SPEAKER_00]: No significant difference on suicidality,
on quality of life, emotional and mental
[SPEAKER_00]: health subscales and functioning scales
were significantly higher in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: users than people who did not use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this study in Canada, again,
big numbers, 888 people with anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at their use rates of other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: 61% had completely replaced a drug that
was prescribed for their condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the most frequently replaced
were antidepressants and benzodiazepines
[SPEAKER_00]: as you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about abuse?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was from the clinical trials of
nabixamol, Sativex that were done in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the only episode in some hundreds
and hundreds of patient exposures
[SPEAKER_00]: attempted abuse of nabixamols.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the perpetrator didn't get inside the
bottle and there he is, a little white
[SPEAKER_00]: dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no abuse or diversion in the
entire program of three phase three
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, interesting relations
between cannabis and addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: J.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Madison, who worked in St. Louis on the
19th century, he used cannabis to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: cocaine, chloral hydrate and opiate
addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quote, in these often it has proved an
efficient substitute for the poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crothers wrote the key textbook on
addiction from the early 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only mention of cannabis was not as a
drug of abuse, but rather as a treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: for other addictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quote, cannabis indica can often be used
with very good effect in treating
[SPEAKER_00]: morphinism, especially the temporary
removal of the worst symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can someone use cannabis medicinally if
they've had a prior problem with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: or opioids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, they can be used quite
successfully together, even in people
[SPEAKER_00]: who've had medical dependency on one or
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after a point at which the patient has
improvement in their symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: most notably pain, it's reasonable to
taper the opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many patients do this on their own and
clinicians here will attest to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone has a clear cannabis use
disorder or it displays tolerance to high
[SPEAKER_00]: doses, Dustin Sulak has a resensitization
procedure, which you can find online,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically has them stop for just 48 hours
and resume at half the point of a prior
[SPEAKER_00]: dose, and usually with equal protection
against the problem for which they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: treating.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are again from nabiximals studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addiction usually comes from some kind of
intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're not intoxicated,
you're highly unlikely to become
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom, you'll see intoxication
scores of nabiximals in clinical trials
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 on this scale, visual analog scale,
is you feel something.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 is what a person usually wants if
they're using cannabis recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that we're looking at
single digits, no significant difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between placebo and nabiximals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addiction usually implies dose escalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top, we see number of sprays a day of
nabiximals over a year and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you see is the slope actually
goes down a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, people find that they do with
less and don't increase their use rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another study from Israel, looking at pain
and quality of life, 176 Israeli patients
[SPEAKER_00]: with pain that qualified for treatment
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average of just a gram and a half a day,
mainly by smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain symptom scores improved along with
family social disability, emotional
[SPEAKER_00]: disability, outcome satisfaction,
and sleep problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the 73 patients who were on opioids,
44% discontinued them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was highly statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the median oral morphine dose
equivalence decreased from 60 to 45
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams a day, obviously less
likelihood of problems related to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banky et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at opioid usage, again,
in patients with chronic pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: 118 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a 64% reduction in opioids and a
45% increase in quality of life measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that could be related to fewer
side effects related to the opioids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll take it any way we can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brilliant Stacey Gruber, who we'll be
hearing from tomorrow, did this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: She always has funny titles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grass might be greener.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at patients who were using
cannabis medicinally for a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems over three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were marked improvements on
depression, on the Beck scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: impulsivity, sleep, quality of life,
and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fewer physical limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For patients who are on opioids,
the intake was reduced almost by half,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, almost by half on benzodiazepines,
a quarter on antidepressants and mood
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilizers after three months of
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, some improvement in cognitive
function could be because of reductions of
[SPEAKER_00]: other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another observation is an occupational
study from Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are patients with cancer and
associated pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the 344 patients that were on opioids
beginning the study, 36% discontinued them
[SPEAKER_00]: and only 9.9%, I'm sorry, 9.9% decreased
their dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 1.1% increased it and 51% remained
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, anxiety and depression declined
84.2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another study from Israel is time in
fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: 26 patients getting a mean dose of 26
grams a day, so less than a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 26 grams a month, less than a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 46% found their work capacity increased
and there was substantial opioid sparing
[SPEAKER_00]: and decreased use of adjunctive drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see under strong opiates a p-value of
zero, meaning no chance this was a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an animal study from Giedal
looking at CB2 receptor modulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: cocaine activity in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 is expressed in the ventral tegmental
area and nucleus accumbens, dopaminergic
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons that pertain to addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when CB2 is activated by the synthetic
agent, it either dose systemically in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nose or microinjection into the nucleus
accumbens and inhibited dopamine release
[SPEAKER_00]: and cocaine self-administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: A natural agent in cannabis,
karyophylline, is an agonist at the CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor and we believe would do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a prior paper, just some
suggestions on what could be used from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to treat different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For depression, small amounts of THC,
CBD, CBG, and limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anxiety, CBD with limonene and
linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add something we're gonna see in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For agitation, Alzheimer disease,
various things help, THC, CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: limonene, pinene, and linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sleep, many different agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for addiction, particularly CBD and
karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: To finish up with some new data,
I'll give you something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study was published last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done with my colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Washington State University in UC
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first study to systematically
examine cannabigerol in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: 127 patients, they were required to report
only on material that was at least 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some had pure CBG with terpenoids,
some were mixed with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this long list of conditions that
people used to treat it with cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: 51% said that the use was medical,
only 6.3 claimed it to be recreational,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for 36.2% both.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common conditions treated were
anxiety, pain, depression, and insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a whole bunch of other things were
tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the majority of conditions were much
or very much improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest efficacy on a percentage basis
were for endometriosis, inflammatory bowel
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, and irritable bowel, but those
were long numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the high numbers, the insomnia,
you see a P value of .001, one chance in a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand that this was a spurious result.
[SPEAKER_00]: For depression and anxiety again,
P values of .001.
[SPEAKER_00]: In every instance, patients felt that CBG
was superior to conventional medicine that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd used to treat their conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot got off of those other
medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll close by saying this bugger you see
depicted here is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't believe in vaccines,
please be advised that I'm a Jewish space
[SPEAKER_00]: laser operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we've left a little time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they've got microphones set
up if you'd like to step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, bad sign, shy audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for all of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you please let these folks know a
little more specifically about how
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis helps dementia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a paper basically on cannabis and
neurology and its promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really didn't fit into this talk well,
but there've been extensive studies that
[SPEAKER_00]: support the idea that both THC and CBD
might actually be neuroprotective in
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer disease by preventing the
buildup of toxic proteins in the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: that are part one of the hallmarks of the
pathology of Alzheimer disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that both of them help a
great deal symptomatically in treating
[SPEAKER_00]: dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Jeff Hergen, rather,
treats a bunch of patients in a nursing
[SPEAKER_00]: home in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nurses love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The families of the patients love it
because the patients are more tractable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They require less nursing care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are showing a resumption of
skills they'd already lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is practical information to
support the use of specific cannabis-based
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments in dementia for both
symptomatic benefits and also as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotective agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see because there's light in my
eyes, but please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your presentation, you referenced some
studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a NIDA-issued cannabis for these
studies, and I wondered the amount of THC
[SPEAKER_02]: that was actually administered or was a
part of that study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you estimate what is the amount of
THC in the National Institute of Drug
[SPEAKER_02]: Abuse-issued cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complex one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stuff was under 4% that they
utilized, but high volumes, nine grams a
[SPEAKER_00]: day, you can start calculating even with a
reduced bioavailability in joint points.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a minimum, it had to be in the 30 to 50
milligrams of THC a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the patients had almost complete
tolerance to intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could demonstrate minor differences
when they were actually smoking on the
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropsych test, but they all functioned
really well and far better than they had
[SPEAKER_00]: before such treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about miserable diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get into this program, you had to
exhaust every medical possibility and
[SPEAKER_00]: prove that to a skeptical government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a high bar indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recognize the voice.
[SPEAKER_07]: The need for safe and effective
psychiatric treatments is probably more
[SPEAKER_07]: now than ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the field of psychiatry, from my
experience, is the most reluctant to even
[SPEAKER_07]: consider cannabis as a useful option.
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, physicians have the highest
rate of suicide among any profession.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're also miserable in this field,
not us specifically, but our colleagues
[SPEAKER_07]: are.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you see this information and this
treatment making its way to the patients
[SPEAKER_07]: that need it?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you see, at a macro level,
the healing of this health care approach
[SPEAKER_07]: to mental health?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been doing this for 26 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say that the roadblocks to
research remain largely the same as they
[SPEAKER_00]: were in the late 90s when I began this,
which is a very sad state of affairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't be ceding the ability to
invest and investigate cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinally to other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even now, Sue Sisley did a recent study of
post-traumatic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had to use NIDA cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The study was not successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows that cannabis can be used
successfully to treat PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a severe mismatch here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it remains the case, if I have a
preparation that I think is gonna be good
[SPEAKER_00]: for treating a specific condition,
and I wanna get FDA approval, can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: made in this country right this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This explains why, for a majority of the
last 26 years, I've worked for foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have to be doggedly persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have been, but I'm 70 years old
now, and I get tired from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need young, young physicians who are
dedicated like Dr. Sulak, Goldstein,
[SPEAKER_00]: and many others to carry on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just takes dogged determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully some legislative change,
but I wouldn't be hanging my hat on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the way things are going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Russo, can you cite some studies of
the effect of cannabis on bipolar
[SPEAKER_08]: disorder, types one and two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a tougher one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bipolar's hard to treat with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear reports of benefit in specific
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is dependent on the
preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really have to think about,
I think it needs to be individualized.
[SPEAKER_00]: With bipolarity, there are just vast
differences in the cycles that people
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are rapid cyclers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have predominantly depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are predominantly manic.
[SPEAKER_00]: For better or worse, a lot of people with
bipolar disorder don't wanna medicate
[SPEAKER_00]: because they like how they feel when
they're manic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very tough problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it shouldn't be
investigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just right now we have only anecdotal
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a question kind of for the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the problem of studying whole
plant or full spectrum products,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you think about... So you can do a
clinical trial of Marinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, it's done regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use full spectrum hemp
extract, so below the .3% THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you dial in the dose of THC that you
want, mix that together with a full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum hemp extract as an excipient,
combine that product, pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: approximate a full spectrum cannabis
product, and do a study with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would tell you that I've talked to
the DEA and the FDA on this, and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: gone ahead and said, yeah, you can do that
legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about that as a
potential way through the regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: nuisance of the federal government?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what I'd say initially is you
shouldn't be having to jump through all
[SPEAKER_00]: these hoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, I'm a firm believer in
full spectrum products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also... And you can mix and match.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, it's not commonly known that
Nabiximals is a combination of a high THC
[SPEAKER_00]: chemover and a high CBD chemover.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's allowed as long as it comes from
one species, i.e., cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to make a bold statement,
which is I think that very few studies of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use therapeutically have used
optimized preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have strong opinions about what you need
for a given condition, and the profiles of
[SPEAKER_00]: the materials used have rarely jibed with
what I think is gonna be best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I think the best approach is
look at the disorder, what is needed,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the combination of cannabinoids,
keeping in mind that if you need THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: like with PTSD, you've gotta have THC for
it to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to suppress dream and nightmare
activity to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tiny doses are necessary, and maybe
with higher doses of CBD, cannabigerol,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with a good terpenoid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an ignored aspect of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have studies underway that we hope will
definitively show the contributions and
[SPEAKER_00]: synergy between the terpenoids and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see a lot more thought go into
the preparations and not just some generic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that comes from a barrel at NIDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Dr. Russo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your speech today and all of
your hard work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very fascinated by this tolerance in
adolescents under 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if you could elucidate
upon any studies on longitudinal studies
[SPEAKER_05]: on psychiatric effects of use of cannabis
from the age of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of any evidence of,
particularly in therapeutic use,
[SPEAKER_00]: of any kind of neuropsychological
sequelae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the evidence from... If we look
at the recreational data that we saw with
[SPEAKER_00]: much higher doses, and it would include
people that started at age 10 or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no evidence of significant
adverse effects that were attributable to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean everyone should do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that cannabis is a reasonable and
can be a safe alternative for treating
[SPEAKER_00]: serious medical conditions of children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, under 10, it's not just that one
study that showed the phenomenon that
[SPEAKER_00]: children are highly resistant to problems
at a young age.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was noted back in 1840 by
O'Shaughnessy in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a child, an infant in fact,
with convulsions that took a dose that
[SPEAKER_00]: would have laid out an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea that we've got to protect the
children, usually you're treating diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: that are far worse and more dangerous to
their lives than cannabis would be in any
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So piggybacking off of what Alex said,
where's cannabis' role in treating this
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of pediatric mental health crisis
that we're going through?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working in a pediatric emergency
department.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you that we're dealing with
more and more issues, and I know cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: has a role.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was curious to get your take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monitors are in front of me and it's a
little boomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could repeat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially, we have a mental health
crisis, particularly amongst pediatric
[SPEAKER_03]: population, and I wanted to know your take
on where exactly cannabis plays a role and
[SPEAKER_03]: if it is CBD dominant, type 2,
type 3, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, cannabidiol as a pure
preparation, Epidiolex 97% CBD is FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: approved for Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut
syndromes and treatment of seizures and
[SPEAKER_00]: tuberous sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody objected much to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Pamplona indicated through his
meta-analysis that similar results could
[SPEAKER_00]: be obtained with doses of CBD that were
about 80% lower when it was a full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using 1,500 milligrams of CBD a day is
prohibitively expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we have to be more reasonable
about the cost-benefit ratio and whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it is intractable seizures, autism,
any serious disorder of childhood that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis might help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is a proper area to investigate,
is my feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically related to mental health.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was curious about your take on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we have a self-destructive
autistic child that is on the verge of
[SPEAKER_00]: being institutionalized, yeah,
they should be treated with something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conventional medicine is notoriously poor
at helping those children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Goldstein, in particular, can attest
to the benefits she's seen in that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: context.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Russo, Judge Thompson.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a newbie to the conference and
appreciate the evolutionary aspect of the
[SPEAKER_06]: clinical studies that you presented.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess my question is from the healthcare
utilization, health services perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is anybody doing work to document
reduction in healthcare utilization to
[SPEAKER_06]: quantify the cost-effectiveness that you
just mentioned and make the argument for
[SPEAKER_06]: broader support?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's been good evidence,
particularly studies of Bradford and
[SPEAKER_00]: Bradford looking at Medicaid and Medicare
populations and use rates of narcotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marked reductions have been noted in
states with legal medical access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, reduction in overdose deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you have to be careful there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deaths have clearly gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't claim causation, but it's a
reasonable inference that the reductions
[SPEAKER_00]: might be due to cannabis availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of us believe that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not sure how... We're cutting
