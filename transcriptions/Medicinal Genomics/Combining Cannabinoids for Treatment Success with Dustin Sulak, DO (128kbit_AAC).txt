[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Dr. Dustin Sulak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dustin is a traditional osteopathic
physician, an expert in integrative
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: His clinical practice in Maine focuses on
treating refractory conditions in adults
[SPEAKER_00]: and children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sulak is an internationally renowned
expert in medical cannabis, the author of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Handbook of Cannabis for Clinicians,
Principles and Practices, and co-founder
[SPEAKER_00]: of Healer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A medical cannabis education resource and
products company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He serves on the board of directors for
the Society of Cannabis Clinicians and is
[SPEAKER_00]: a passionate educator and leader in the
medical cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dustin is also a true CanMed veteran,
having participated in every CanMed event
[SPEAKER_00]: dating back to our first conference at
Harvard Medical School.
[SPEAKER_00]: He returns to CanMed 24 this year as one
of the medical practicum instructors and
[SPEAKER_00]: an oral presenter presenting the art and
science of combining cannabinoids for
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment success.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss what
attendees can expect from the CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: medical practicum, the expansion of
available cannabinoids and how Dustin
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluates new options, which cannabinoid
Dustin would choose if he could only use
[SPEAKER_00]: one to treat patients, the difference
between acidic and neutral forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, the process for combining
cannabinoids, and challenging old
[SPEAKER_00]: assumptions about the benefits of
combining CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with Dr.
Sulak, I wanted to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Healer.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dustin Sulak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Dustin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast yet again.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we are thrilled to have you back,
not only on the podcast, but to have you
[SPEAKER_00]: back for CanMed 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was rewatching your CanMed 23
presentation just this morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you mentioned how the event last year
felt like a family working towards a
[SPEAKER_00]: common mission, which was so great to
hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly feel that way, and we
appreciate you being part of that family
[SPEAKER_00]: and playing such an important role in the
event since the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you reminded me of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it really did have that feeling
like a huge family on vacation together,
[SPEAKER_01]: learning together.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was just so much passion and
collaboration and interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a beautiful environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you're returning again as
one of the instructors for the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: practicum, which will be taking place on
Monday, May 13th, which is a full day
[SPEAKER_00]: workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a crash course in
cannabinoid medicine with you and Dr.
Bonnie Healer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've heard of Bonnie Goldstein,
Eloise Thiessen, and new this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ethan Rousseau, which is quite the
lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to give you an opportunity to
kind of talk about the value of the
[SPEAKER_00]: practicum for folks who might be
interested in attending.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we received so much good feedback on
the practicum last year, and it's always a
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've had some people in the
audience that could potentially be up on
[SPEAKER_01]: stage helping teach experts with a lot of
experience in cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, all the way to clinicians
that have never recommended cannabis to a
[SPEAKER_01]: patient before that just kind of like took
the leap to come to CanMed to this event
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really nice to get a mixed crowd
like that, you know, so much relating and
[SPEAKER_01]: learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the conversations that were
going on in between the lectures were just
[SPEAKER_01]: fabulous, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the feedback we got was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the practicum is soup to nuts kind of
you're a medical provider and you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: know about cannabis and how to get great
results treating your patients with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, know what the what the risks
are, the contraindications, how to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation about it with your patient,
but also know how to think about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the physiology, the pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are able to pack that all into one
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remarkably, there's always a lot of but
it's just very concise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that year after year,
we've been able to refine it and get the
[SPEAKER_01]: curriculum to a point of what's most
relevant to medical providers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a yeah, it's a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing that we get that much
information across also accepted and based
[SPEAKER_01]: on the feedback retained in just one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, and it's a great sort of
prerequisite for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: conference to gives you people a nice
foundation to be for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually had quite a few people that
were not clinicians that came in and were
[SPEAKER_01]: also just thrilled that they had made the
choice to do that, to attend the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: practicum, you know, even just some
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, this was so much
over my head, but it really, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like validated what I'm what I was
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's there's people in the
cannabis industry that are working on
[SPEAKER_01]: other aspects of the industry,
not like the provider patient aspect of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think for them to, you know,
get a glimpse into what's in our world,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's important to us, what we're
thinking and talking about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really validates and kind of,
you know, solidifies their experience as
[SPEAKER_01]: part of this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're also going to be giving an
oral presentation at CanMed 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got you working hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the art and science of
combining cannabinoids for treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we get into sort of the
benefits of combining cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you about just the sheer
number of cannabinoids that are available
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how has that sort of changed since you
first started working in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like we've known for since I
started that this plant was a treasure
[SPEAKER_01]: chest of different medicinal compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we really had was THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I started in 2009 in Maine and
it was, you know, like sending letters to
[SPEAKER_01]: people on the West Coast asking if we
could get some of these CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't really even CBD dominant back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like more like type two,
chemo type two varieties mixed THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a handful of them available.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really need these in Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard this great stuff about CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then 2013, we finally had
access to CBD and thought that was great
[SPEAKER_01]: and thought we knew what we were talking
about when it came to combining THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this kind of, you know,
somewhat limited black and white idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: what the combination does together that
has been persistent through now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over the last five years or so,
we've been working with therapeutically
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant amounts of THC, CBD and CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the more prominent newcomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBN is in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's some isomers and
synthetics which are worth talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though I'm not sure they're that
valuable clinically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them probably have some value.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's the real mystery,
which is the combination of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can isolate them out and do a
preclinical rodent experiments and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand their pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where the rubber meets the road in the
clinic, you know, understanding how to
[SPEAKER_01]: make selections for what to treat patients
with and then how to interpret their
[SPEAKER_01]: response to those choices, how to kind of
orient around dosing and what are some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the general strategies when it comes to
combining cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole new area of medicine that
cannabis is kind of leaning us into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, maybe it's not new.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this idea of polypharmacology or
network pharmacology using multiple agents
[SPEAKER_01]: with different mechanisms of action to get
better results than relying on a single
[SPEAKER_01]: agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not new, but it's just amazing how
cannabis kind of mandates that we learn
[SPEAKER_01]: that and take that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's doing so more and more all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is this, you know, kind of
expansion of available compounds and in
[SPEAKER_00]: different combinations?
[SPEAKER_00]: How has it made finding the right medicine
more difficult for you and for patients
[SPEAKER_00]: and consumers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's, yeah, so there's more options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly can be more overwhelming if you
don't have kind of a methodical way of
[SPEAKER_01]: sorting through it, which is what I'm
hoping to convey in my presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think cannabis was already
overwhelming to people, even when they
[SPEAKER_01]: just had, you know, a few options.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they, you know, for example,
if they look at our medicinal products at
[SPEAKER_01]: Healer, you know, we've got all these
different products, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to make a chart for how they can
sort through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is it is it does get overwhelming
for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other side of it, though,
what I think we're seeing as a benefit is
[SPEAKER_01]: that patients who may not have responded
to cannabis, say we were just using THC
[SPEAKER_01]: and we really did our best to get THC to
work for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't work, you know, instead of
saying, OK, I guess, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're one of these very few people that
just doesn't respond well to cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: we better try something non cannabis next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have more things to try and things
that from all that we know these other
[SPEAKER_01]: options have a similar safety profile and
have a similar capacity to help with this
[SPEAKER_01]: broad range of conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's not like we discovered a new
cannabinoid that's perfect for just this
[SPEAKER_01]: one diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go again with another compound
that could work in all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnoses, all these different fields of
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just adds to the complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until we you know, I think until we
get like supercomputers working on this
[SPEAKER_01]: problem where, you know, human beings are
going to be the best the best one to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of determine where are we going to start?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we going to try next?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we what's it going to take for us
to decide this really isn't the right fit
[SPEAKER_01]: for you before we move on?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the basic questions that I'm
hoping to help clinicians answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you mentioned Healer Dotcom,
and I'm glad you did, because I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to ask you, what is your process
for for adding new products like new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids into your portfolio?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got a big pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the wish list is big.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have prototypes and so, you know,
things that I find interesting based on
[SPEAKER_01]: preclinical literature, based on what
people are telling me, we usually make a
[SPEAKER_01]: prototype and share it around with the
staff and with myself and some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues and see what people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a good example of this is our I
think it's our newest product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, it's a combination of CBDA and
CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBGA, like who knows anything about
CBGA?
[SPEAKER_01]: You look in the peer review literature,
there's so little on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a few a few more hits just this
past year, but it's is it similar to CBG,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we also don't know that much about,
but we know more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it different than CBG?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of unknowns there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was this, you know, preclinical
study that gained a lot of headlines about
[SPEAKER_01]: how it could inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus
in its infectious potential in mice and in
[SPEAKER_01]: cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we thought, well, you know,
we've seen such impressive results with
[SPEAKER_01]: the acidic cannabinoids, the THCA and the
CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of makes sense for us to explore
CBGA next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started playing around with it and we
found that in combination with CBDA,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seemed to be doing something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we weren't testing it against
SARS, you know, like against COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just taking it and see how we
felt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were reporting very similar
things that this combination made them
[SPEAKER_01]: feel alert, awake, focused, like in the
zone, resilient to stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't expect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't exactly know what's the
mechanism of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: But enough of us felt like, well,
this is a prototype worth bringing to
[SPEAKER_01]: market that, you know, that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still have so much to learn from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, even CBG, I knew it had
a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we know about it in humans right
now, other than the anecdotes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost nothing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one survey study and the people in
that study weren't, you know, the data is
[SPEAKER_01]: just not very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a good starting point,
but we don't know exactly how much most of
[SPEAKER_01]: them were taking or what other
cannabinoids they were taking it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, we currently have
an ongoing another survey of CBG users to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to clarify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like you get something that's
a hit in a small number of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You allow other kind of cannabis
enthusiasts to start using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then before too long, we've got some
signals that are worth following.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we do the observation over research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of confirm what we think we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, maybe that leads to
more more clinical trials or more animal
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it's so backwards with
cannabis that we start with humans and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we go to the after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of our process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the the idea that we just
don't want to have too many products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it does get confusing and
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there can be kind of a downside where
people are, you know, just looking at it
[SPEAKER_01]: and not sure what to take or there's no
good algorithm for helping them make a
[SPEAKER_01]: selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they might make the wrong selection
and kind of rule out cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, oh, I tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to try anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's there's pros and cons of
everything in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of, you know, from a personal
standpoint, my mom has been dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: some some back pain and she's done
physical therapy and some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really seem to be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, have you tried
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like, well, what do I get?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I was like, well,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a THC, THCA, CBD,
CBDA, a combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a bit overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, you know, that's where
I'm hoping to train clinicians to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it sounds like, you know, so say we
take someone like your mom with back pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it's not a very complex case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe I would get her in the
office and ask her a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end, she's just a lady with,
you know, some like intermittent back
[SPEAKER_01]: pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no big injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not worried about any kind of like,
you know, spinal stenosis or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got a sore back and she did her PT
and her exercise is not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I use for pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm going to have a very few
number of questions that I'm going to need
[SPEAKER_01]: to know where to get her started.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not going to be rocket science.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just to use this as an example
for our audience today, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one question is going to be, is the back
pain disturbing your sleep or is your
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep disturbed for some other reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it is, to me, that is the low
hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get somebody sleeping better,
it's very likely their next day is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very likely their healing system is
going to take over and fix the underlying
[SPEAKER_01]: cause of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my mind, in my experience,
THC is still the winner when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: improving sleep in just about anyone,
but certainly in anyone whose sleep is
disturbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: By either pain or anxiety, especially
trauma related anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe your mom's never tried
cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm talking to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no clue if she's going to be a two
milligram person or a 20 milligram person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, I'm going to start
her at two and very gradually work up,
[SPEAKER_01]: see, see if she's a responder when it
comes to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if she is, we'll say,
okay, let's watch for a month or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if your daytime symptoms resolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't come on back and let's,
let's talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about step two.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we treat you during the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just kind of my clinical
approach, which I think doesn't have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusively clinical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think through education, we can bring
that to the consumer and they can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: skip the clinician and, and get good
results with, with the right information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and it really seems like it's a
process of, you know, trying something for
[SPEAKER_00]: a period of time, really checking in with
yourself, seeing how that's working and
[SPEAKER_00]: then adjusting accordingly.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do you, you know, shooting from
the hip and trying the right thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there are different personalities
too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe your mom's someone that loves doing
things methodically, or maybe she's
[SPEAKER_01]: someone that like, if it's not going to
show her something, some improvement
[SPEAKER_01]: within four days, she's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's kind of the art in
medicine is like figuring out which
[SPEAKER_01]: patient is which and how aggressive we
need to be at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say, you know, all these new
cannabinoids are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not replace THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not, not one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is still such a powerful agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I could only choose one to
work with, that would certainly still be
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause one of the things I was going to
sort of ask about is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: after we're talking about the variety of
cannabinoids, sort of narrowing things
[SPEAKER_00]: down a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And am I correct in assuming that,
well, you've already confirmed that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, THC being kind of one of the
most well-studied, widely available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you also put CBD and potentially CBG
in sort of that category of sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe most effective cannabinoids or most
well-known cannabinoids at least right
[SPEAKER_00]: now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well known for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if I, you know, what I said
about THC before, if I could only have
[SPEAKER_01]: one, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think if, if the, if the
offering was for me to only have two you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, if it was THC and the second best,
what would that be at this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would choose CBD A over CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me and most people to do just
about everything that CBD does,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to do so more powerfully and at a
lower dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what I just said does not apply
to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people that try both and then
go back to CBD, but the vast majority will
[SPEAKER_01]: try both and say, well, the CBDA actually
worked a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stick with CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that at Healer, we offered
CBDA samples to our CBD customers and most
[SPEAKER_01]: of them switched over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will, I will confess, not confess,
but disclose I am a CBDA user of Healer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a believer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then CBG, you know, I'm still
figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly seems powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, it sells well.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get it and then they want to get it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think that it's helping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some remarkable results
clinically, you know, not with everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: that tries it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say a lot of people it's, it's more
similar to a CBD ish response.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, yeah, I tried the CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's helping me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, oh my God, you changed my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like myself again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've returned to work from being disabled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those are the stories that we hear
about with THC, you know, I don't get that
[SPEAKER_01]: much of that with CBG except once in a
while I do, I do hear something that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's pretty profound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, so you mentioned CBD versus CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that scenario, do they have similar
kind of therapeutic or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: similar effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know that in some cases,
the neutral versus the acid, they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have opposite effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the targets of CBD and CBDA are
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, if you look at THC versus
THCA and compare their pharmacology in the
[SPEAKER_01]: body, very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people take them, they feel very
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD versus CBDA is much more similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so probably, you know, one of the
targets that's going to be most important
[SPEAKER_01]: for, for people that are using this is
the, the activity of the serotonin
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they both can kind of reduce anxiety
and improve mood via that serotonin
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's been a number of animals
studies looking at the two, sometimes not
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same study, but two different
studies that have used the same model to
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluate CBDA versus CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see that they, they can do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both can reduce seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both can decrease inflammatory pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both can decrease nausea and
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's, there's a lot of
overlap there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanistically, it's usually the same
targets, the way in which they're
[SPEAKER_01]: achieving these outcomes is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the dosing is often vastly different
with CBDA requiring a much lower dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: suggesting it has, well, what we know from
the animal studies is that it has both
[SPEAKER_01]: better bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take a dose, more of it's getting into
the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it also has more potency once
it's in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look at brain levels or
blood levels of these compounds that are
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary to achieve their result,
you need much less of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more gets in and you need much less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one of the downsides is that CBD
seems to last longer in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDA, you'll excrete more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might therefore have to take it more
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but a lot of overlap there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of a, one of the nuggets
that I picked up watching your
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation from last year was you showed
some graphs showing that CBDA is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: better absorbed when it's part of a full
plant extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is that, that, I mean, there's,
there's findings in rodents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we haven't proven that for
humans yet, but based on what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing, when people say, you know,
we get, we're taking these low doses and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're working really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is a human study that
showed CBDA absorption through the gut was
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't test it like it did in the
rodent study on its own versus in the
[SPEAKER_01]: context of a whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the information we have is
pointing to what you said that essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's a little bit of THC or CBG,
present with the CBDA, you might absorb it
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least a rodent might absorb it like
15 times more of it, with just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of THC or CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of us would have planned that,
but I think a lot of us would have said,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a pretty good chance that for one
reason or another, taking this thing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the context of the whole plant is going to
beat taking the isolated compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's just the lesson we've
learned again and again and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be exceptions to that
lesson, you know, in certain situations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but typically that is the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once in a while, we know why that's
the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those scenarios where we
think we know why that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that speaks to the topic at hand here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This combining cannabinoids for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in the presentation,
we go through what we know about the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacokinetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is how do drugs or compounds
interact with each other as they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting absorbed as they're getting
metabolized and as they're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: excreted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have quite a bit of information
about these various cannabinoids and what
[SPEAKER_01]: some different combinations will do
pharmacokinetically when they're in each
[SPEAKER_01]: other's presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of one chunk of what I'm
presenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another aspect of it would be the
pharmacodynamic interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are not about absorption and
metabolism, but about how they actually
[SPEAKER_01]: act, their mechanism of action,
their pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that when these two are present,
it might see one thing compared to when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're, you know, on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the pharmacokinetics,
the pharmacodynamics, and then strategies
[SPEAKER_01]: for both clinicians and patients about how
are we going to sort through this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's step one?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's step two?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we combine things?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the main content in my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and kind of the process I'm very
interested in, like, is it better to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's always dependent on the
person and the condition, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is it better to start with a
combination and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe zero in on maybe a single compound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it better to start with one and then
start adding things in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of how does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it depends on some factors,
but I am very comfortable starting with
[SPEAKER_01]: combinations and more simple cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you just told me what you told me
about your mom, and I started saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, you know, like, tell me, does it
radiate down her leg?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, does it disturb her sleep?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I couldn't get any more
information out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'd start her with the combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably recommend our formula that's
like equal parts THC, CBD, CBDA,
[SPEAKER_01]: and THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's got like, we call it the
balance formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's only one quarter THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, not too strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy for people to titrate in small
increments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally made from 19 different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a huge shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would I take that shotgun approach as my
first line with someone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it plenty of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a more sensitive case,
maybe it's someone who's already tried
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and hasn't really succeeded or
has a history of being ultra sensitive to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, or it's a high stakes case where
it's like, we got to get results fast or
[SPEAKER_01]: this person's going south or their
families, you know, this person's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be institutionalized or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if there's some urgency there,
I might not just start with the shotgun
[SPEAKER_01]: approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might take a really kind of accelerated
and targeted approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of times I do what we talked
about before, like I'll treat the sleep
[SPEAKER_01]: problem with THC and then they'll come
back and say like, yeah, I guess I got a
[SPEAKER_01]: few little remaining things, but the bulk
of what I came to you for is fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'll start with a balanced formula,
kind of a shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll say, you know what,
that works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might say, well, you know,
is there some room for fine tuning it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you having any other symptoms?
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we do a little fine tuning,
but a lot of times that's not even needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, you know, short answer to your
question is sometimes a combination is a
[SPEAKER_01]: fine place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's good enough for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you hinted at something earlier,
and I know I read it in your abstract too,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to make sure I asked you
about it, was that there's some new
[SPEAKER_00]: research challenging some old assumptions
about the effects of combining THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoping you might elaborate a little bit on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the kind of old adage of CBD is
going to mitigate the side effects of THC
[SPEAKER_01]: while augmenting the benefits of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is definitely some truth there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen the product Sativex designed by
Ethan Russo, which combined the THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: the CBD in roughly equal proportions,
and that's been very successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's helped a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while there is some truth to that
statement, there's a lot of nuance,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there are many situations that I've
seen and that we are now seeing in human
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical research where that is just not
the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're adding CBD to THC does not mitigate
the side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can actually enhance the side effects,
and it may dampen the benefits in certain
[SPEAKER_01]: cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one example would be a study of people
with fibromyalgia who have vaporized
[SPEAKER_01]: either THC dominant or combined THC,
CBD, cannabis, and rate how it affects
[SPEAKER_01]: their pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blinded, they rate how it affects
their pain, and they have their blood
[SPEAKER_01]: levels measured to see how much THC and
CBD in the blood are needed to achieve
[SPEAKER_01]: these reductions in pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turned out based on the results
of that study that the presence of CBD in
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower and in the blood actually
limited THC's ability to treat the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know mechanistically that THC
stimulates the CB1 receptor, and CBD turns
[SPEAKER_01]: down the activity of the CB1 receptor a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of arrogant to think the only
way in which it's going to turn down that
[SPEAKER_01]: activity has to do with negative side
effects, but turning down that activity is
[SPEAKER_01]: never going to bother the positive
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like, you know, physiology doesn't
work like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe sometimes it does, but there is
evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a big, like,
you know, people love grabbing onto things
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis and running with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guilty of this also.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we all think like, oh,
myrcine means it's sedating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myrcine means a lot of things,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like, you know, probably even worse
than that is the whole CBN story that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are going for right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, CBN is valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not putting it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what I might put down is like
dirty CBN that's been manufactured in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way that might not be safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBN itself, you know, there's a couple
studies from like the early 80s that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, showed some people got sedated
and maybe some rodents got sedated when
[SPEAKER_01]: taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they get sedated with THC too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of a sudden, that little bit of
information turned into, wow, CBN is the
[SPEAKER_01]: best for sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's totally bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for some people it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have really more paradoxical
reactions to CBN than they do to THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: it wakes them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less potent than THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need a little more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, try to keep it real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm, you know, also a victim of that
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking sometimes, you know,
like I take what I think I know and run
[SPEAKER_01]: with it and maybe I don't question it
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a kind of a leader and educator in
this industry, I really periodically like
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at all of those assumptions and
challenge them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the challenge on that CBD
THC combination, there's a lot of data to
[SPEAKER_01]: suggest it is not that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it might do the opposite of
what we hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I think we're all sort of
guilty of that, especially in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry where we're learning and,
you know, to keep saying, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it depends is a little exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we can kind of grab onto something
as a bit of an absolute, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Justin, I do want to be mindful
of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I let you go, I want to give
you the opportunity to share any
[SPEAKER_00]: additional resources related to some of
the topics we discussed or that your
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation that you're going to be
giving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, any other information
about you or Healer links that I can put
[SPEAKER_00]: in the show description, please let me
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the topics that we discussed,
this is this is like me pulling together a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of threads that I typically cover
every month, you know, individually and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Healer webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do with these free webinars
every month is go over usually five or six
[SPEAKER_01]: different research studies that have come
out recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I think are interesting or clinically
relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that keeps me on top of the
literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also keeps my audience up to date
with what's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then I you know, what I've done
with this presentation is kind of zoom out
[SPEAKER_01]: and say, like over the last two or three
years, what have I learned about combining
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that affect my clinical practice?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can I synthesize this for an audience
in a concise way?
[SPEAKER_01]: But for people that are excited to be kind
of like the first to know and on the front
[SPEAKER_01]: lines, please check out Healer dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find a tab there for webinars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The webinars are free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone can join them and they happen every
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to happen in March, though,
because I'm having a baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm taking one month off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a lot of other resources on
Healer dot com dosage programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if if if it weren't you,
Ben, someone that knows a lot about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but if it were someone else
asking me about their mom, I'd say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just send her to Healer dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell her to go through the program called
New to Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how to get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I think by the end of that show,
have a lot more confidence and a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of the basics without
needing to become an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I would just like to say
is I would love people listening to this
[SPEAKER_01]: to find this conversation interesting to
come to Can Med.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's just a beautiful experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to be there with you on the
beach and in the lecture hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'd like as many of the right
people who are truly interested and
[SPEAKER_01]: inspired in this field.
[SPEAKER_01]: To to show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please consider it will be worth every
penny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a beautiful event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're so happy to have you be a
part of it this year and for all the years
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the support over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We so much appreciate it.
