[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics, a proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_01]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I do apologize for the lack of
quality in the video here, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: watching us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually on the road at a conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm in a hotel room with my fake
background here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's not too much of a distraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only going to be for this intro and
for the outro.
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual interview is going to be the
same quality that you know and love,
[SPEAKER_01]: but wanted to acknowledge it right off the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, just a few reminders before I
introduce this week's guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this episode on the
day it's released, then I'd like to remind
[SPEAKER_01]: you that the early bird deadline for the
CanMed 24 Innovation and Investment Summit
[SPEAKER_01]: is this Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday, December 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Friday, December 1st is the last day
you can purchase your CanMed 24 ticket at
[SPEAKER_01]: the lowest price available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will save $300 off our full summit
package, which includes access to the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical practicum, industry workshops,
oral presentations, poster presentations,
[SPEAKER_01]: networking events, meals, and a
three-night stay at the J.W.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marriott Marco Island Resort with all the
associated amenities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Head over to CanMedEvents.com now to
register, and I hope to see you in Florida
[SPEAKER_01]: this May.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, our CanMed Advisory Board is
reviewing the abstract submissions we
[SPEAKER_01]: received for oral and poster
presentations, and we hope to be
[SPEAKER_01]: announcing some presenters very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have already seen that we
announced that the Capital Markets
[SPEAKER_01]: Workshop will return for CanMed 24,
led by Golden Eagle Partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are also going to have a special
nursing panel on Sunday, May 13th.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can learn more about both of those
sessions at CanMedEvents.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while you're there, be sure to sign up
for email alerts so you can get those
[SPEAKER_01]: announcements right to your inbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dr. Carla Gage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carla is Assistant Professor of Weed
Science and Plant Biology at Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: Illinois University, Carbondale,
where she received her PhD in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: biology with a focus in weeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: In short, Carla is a weed expert,
but not in the weed that you smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: but rather the weeds that you pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her research focuses on using integrated
weed management to control and suppress
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds in Midwestern U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: rotational crops, including corn,
soybean, wheat, and now hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: During our conversation, we discussed what
negative effects weeds can have on hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: which weed species are threatening to
hemp, herbicides that are approved for
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and the threat of herbicide
resistance, integrated weed management
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies such as crop rotation,
cover crops, chaff lining, plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: coverings, and more, and how feral hemp
varieties may have traits to help breed
[SPEAKER_01]: for more resistant hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Carla, I'd like to thank this episode
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor Rare Earth Genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rare Earth Genomics Texas is a partnership
formed to accelerate hemp research and
[SPEAKER_01]: produce critical tools for the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: REG's mission is to increase the
likelihood of a successful harvest through
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic analysis and rigorous
environmental testing of vigorous
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reliable data sets, analytic tools,
and stable germplasm are core to the
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Success for the farmer is the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can learn more at rareearthgenomics
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Dr. Carla Gage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Carla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a pleasure to be here to talk
with you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to talk with you today about
weed control in outdoor hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've covered other plant pathogens on
the podcast before hoplite and viroid,
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew, pythium, botrytis,
all those things, and even got into pests
[SPEAKER_01]: before with russet mites, spider mites,
et cetera, but never weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect that's because so much of
cannabis cultivation occurs indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know that the majority of hemp
cultivation is outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after all, hemp and cannabis are the
same plant for all intents and purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be fun to dive into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the negative effects that weeds
can have on hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with any crop, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeds can directly compete by taking
resources that the crop needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: resources like nutrients, water,
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that direct form of
competition, but there are also other
[SPEAKER_00]: indirect things that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, cannabis can exude some
biochemical substances that can interfere
[SPEAKER_00]: with the growth of other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially that's something that my lab
has been looking at, but weeds do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a weed that's competing with a crop
plant may be releasing biochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds or having other effects on that
plant that are beyond just the direct
[SPEAKER_00]: competition for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I know that hemp can be grown for
all different sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiber, grain, seed, and of course,
cannabinoid rich flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there different considerations
there for how weeds can affect the crop
[SPEAKER_01]: for what the crop will be used for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty amazing to look at all the
different crop morphologies, meaning that
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're growing for each of those
different commodities, the crop that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing is going to probably look
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if I'm growing a fiber crop,
that plant has been bred over time to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: directly upright, to not branch very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's planted very densely together in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for weed competition, that would be a
very competitive crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it gets established, there should
be relatively few weeds coming up below
[SPEAKER_00]: that crop canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can contrast that with how dual
purpose crops are grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those would be crops that you would
harvest for both seed and fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are typically shorter plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit more branchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're spaced out more in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more potential for weed
competition below that crop canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the most sensitive
type of cultivation to weed competition
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the CBD floral biotype,
where those plants, they are branchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do take up a lot of space as they
grow, but they're planted at a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: distance from one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to do some weed control
around them, whether that's black plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch or other organic mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be some other type of weed
control tactic because the crop itself is
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to suppress weeds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, depending on what commodity type
you're growing, the weed control problems
[SPEAKER_00]: can be dramatically different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there any sort of numbers around
like weeds can affect your yield by X
[SPEAKER_01]: percent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, that is such a fascinating
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is really one of the things we're
trying to determine with our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2019, there was a publication that came
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically a review of all the
global literature looking at hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of the publications that were
reviewed, weeds were either neglected,
[SPEAKER_00]: not even mentioned in the publications,
or they were mentioned as inconsequential
[SPEAKER_00]: to the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings up a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know that this should be a
competitive crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is a nitrophilous species,
meaning it should be able to accumulate
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and use nitrogen very efficiently
and could probably out-compete a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key seems to be getting it
established because even in our own
[SPEAKER_00]: research, we have seen a good number of
crop failures when the weeds come up
[SPEAKER_00]: before the hemp or at the same time as the
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of times we don't even get
a good hemp stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the weeds and not the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that competition is a problem,
yet the effects have been inconclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that my lab has been
working on, we do have some funding from
[SPEAKER_00]: the USDA as part of a larger multi-state
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been looking at what is called
the critical weed-free period in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all crops have this sort of
theoretical concept where if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: control the weeds during so many weeks
initially as the crop gets established,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can maintain reasonable yields by
the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this critical period when
plants are more sensitive to competition
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have to really take care of the
weeds during that period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were looking at this and there
were students in my lab that were weeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: hand weeding our hemp plots at different
intervals throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the plots were not weeded at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted the hemp and walked away
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a treatment that was
only weeded for a week and then two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: and three weeks and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was one treatment that was
weeded for the entire season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were all a little surprised when we
did a preliminary analysis of the data and
[SPEAKER_00]: we found that statistically, there was no
difference whether or not we didn't weed
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants at all or whether we weeded for
87 days, which was the entire season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we thought as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see a little bit of evidence for
heavy grass competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see that the plots where there
was a lot of grass competing around,
[SPEAKER_00]: those were our 14 day weed treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could see a hit in the overall
biomass with some of the competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was just amazing that statistically
there was no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're now in our second year of that
study and we'll be doing a more detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: data analysis and we'll be looking at all
the different yield components because
[SPEAKER_00]: that was just a rough look at overall
biomass of fiber and dual purpose crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it seems like it's one of those
crops where if it gets a head start,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fairly competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So timing is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but so just want to make sure I heard
that correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount that you weeded,
whether you did none at all or you weeded
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the whole thing, it didn't have
an effect on the overall yield at the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't on the overall biomass that was
produced, not looking at quality of fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: or amount of seed yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just overall plant biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there may be differences for each of
those components, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because plants will, it's an investment
strategy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may have been investing in growth
and in structure and putting less into
[SPEAKER_00]: seed production, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we have two years of data,
I hope that we're able to sort of tease
[SPEAKER_00]: apart any of those differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we do have, of course,
we have a pre-emergence herbicide that's
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if farmers want to grow hemp now,
there's more tools available to give the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp a head start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was going to be one of my
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there approved herbicides for hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is now a pre-emergence herbicide
that would do hopefully what we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about and give the hemp the head start
that it needs for successful production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, there are going to be some
challenges for the weeds in our geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of the problem weeds are going to
be well controlled by this herbicide,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's more than we had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for farmers that are, you know,
accustomed to growing corn and soybeans in
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide managed systems, the goal would
be to see this as another crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially in rotation with those crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons that we have so much
herbicide resistance, besides just the
[SPEAKER_00]: sheer amount of herbicides that we use,
it's because we have very simplified
[SPEAKER_00]: rotations in our agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we could put more crops in rotation
with corn and soybeans, then our pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management challenges would change and we
wouldn't have such dominant weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few things I want to make sure that I
touch on with that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one you said, Dio,
it was specific to your geography.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there regional considerations here?
[SPEAKER_01]: For weed control and hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some species are not uniformly
distributed across the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain geographies that have
different problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think across most of the Midwestern
cropping region, the Amaranthus species
[SPEAKER_00]: are a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar with Amaranthus seed,
it's basically their plants in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: genus as that food crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have become dominant agricultural
weeds and they've evolved resistances to
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple herbicides that have become a
critical part of our crop production
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as they evolve very quickly,
we're losing some of the herbicide tools
[SPEAKER_00]: that our farmers have relied upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something very special about
those weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those Amaranthus weeds are dioecious,
meaning that there are males and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: females and they have to cross pollinate
to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the only species in our
system that are what we call driver weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that are evolving herbicide resistance so
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genetic exchange between those
plants is in a sense driving evolution and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the plant that we're
introducing into the system, this is our
[SPEAKER_00]: first dioecious plant, as far as I've
worked with, that is a crop species now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And does that bring with it other
challenges?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, potentially, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because hemp is the original weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence the name, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have in Illinois victory hemp left
over from World War II era that still
[SPEAKER_00]: grows in the ditch banks and roadsides
around agricultural fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still is persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another another research
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fields where we're growing hemp for
a crop, we're going to have to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: those volunteers as we rotate into other
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how easy is that going to continue to
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to be able to continue to
manage hemp, which is very susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: right now to the herbicides that we use?
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad you kind of brought up the
ditch weed that is still out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that a weed for all intents and
purposes for if you're growing hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: could that potentially be an issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing floral CBD hemp,
then yes, that is an issue for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: your product quality and potentially for
for other crops as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think more importantly, it's it's
it's important to consider that as a
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir for very important genetic
traits that might be useful for future
[SPEAKER_00]: crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants have existed for decades
successfully in these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are tolerant to the environmental
conditions that they're being exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: and to the ecological interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that shouldn't be dismissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they should be devalued.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that in the future, they could
have a very real a very, a very real
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution to future breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's well, that's actually very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you are aware,
but here at medicinal genomics,
[SPEAKER_01]: we do sequencing on cannabis varieties,
hemp varieties, things like that to help
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders kind of identify these traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we've ever had any ditch
weed or any of that that we've actually
[SPEAKER_01]: sequenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we have some land race strains that
are kind of from other parts of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if we have any that are
that are native to the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be that'd be really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to I'm going to bring that up to
the CSO right after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, that would be you know,
in southern Illinois, we have a very heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that it interacts with our
heavy spring rainfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a there's a period during the
initial part of the season where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we do have ponding in our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's really difficult for
the early planted hemp crop to survive,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not very tolerant to,
you know, water logging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where, you know, maybe there is,
there's that trait that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those weedy populations that
would allow it to tolerate heavy soils a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, those are the types of things
where, you know, I do think there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of value in looking at those feral
populations that still exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to herbicides, we talked about
that there are some approved or an
[SPEAKER_01]: approved herbicide that recently came
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that hemp is a bioaccumulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there considerations with that and
using like an herbicide that it might,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of accumulate in the crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I guess I'm probably not the
best to talk about herbicide tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So residues in crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do agree that hemp can be a
bioaccumulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the type of production that we're
looking at, I'm really more interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing fiber production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, anything that's
bioaccumulated can actually be a benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use it for remediation purposes,
then you could lock away those chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that the plant takes up in
hempcrete, you know, into structures that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not going to be degraded and released
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, that could be a benefit,
a beneficial characteristic of that crop
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be careful for other food
based commodity types, right, for seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for floral production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I think too that there must be
concerns also if you're growing near other
[SPEAKER_01]: crops that some of the herbicides that are
maybe used on those crops could drift into
[SPEAKER_01]: your fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we have seen that a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbicide drift has been a concern,
especially in some geographies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that hemp is sensitive to some of
those herbicides and in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: preliminary work that we've done,
we haven't seen a huge yield impact when
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp is drifted upon by other herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that does go back to the need to
establish herbicide tolerances and safety
[SPEAKER_00]: levels on hemp, depending on what it's
going to be used for in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so given that, you know, hemp was
banned for so long until kind of the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: bill a few years ago kind of opened things
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how far behind are we in in
researching, you know, weed prevention in
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, really far behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's there's not really a lot
known as far as hemp's competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with a colleague here at SIU
to just set up some species by species
[SPEAKER_00]: competition studies just to look at,
you know, some of our most problematic
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds, put them in different numbers,
growing with different number of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in pots in the greenhouse and just
simply look at the impact of that
[SPEAKER_00]: competition at different densities on that
target hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just the things that just a lot of
things that we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, you could take pretty much any
publication that's been done in soybeans,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, looking at weed control and
probably redo that and it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: completely novel and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there there's nothing but questions
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have two herbicides,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the monoline, yeah, ethylfluoroline is
the pre-emergence compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a post-emergence
compound, which is quazolipop or assured
[SPEAKER_00]: to is the trade name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only a grass specific compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can you can spray it across the top
of the hemp plants and and at least kill
[SPEAKER_00]: the grasses that would be competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not going to impact the the
broadleaf plants that are growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: competing with the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so it's but it's you know, it's
something right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's a full herbicide program,
a pre-emergence compound, plus a
[SPEAKER_00]: post-emergence compound that that growers
are conceptually familiar with working
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now are herbicides the best tool
against weed control or are there other
[SPEAKER_01]: other options?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the most commonly used tool as
partly as a as a result of the sheer
[SPEAKER_00]: number of acres that our farmers manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you go into organic
production, for example, you're relying
[SPEAKER_00]: either on tillage to control the weeds up
until a certain point until you can't till
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore without hurting the crop or you're
heavily reliant upon cover crop species
[SPEAKER_00]: that would suppress the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a potential to see cover
crops used in hemp production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there have been some pilot studies
that have been conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the cover crop literature
is well established that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can suppress some of our most
problematic weeds with a with a good cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop that accumulates enough biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the key is giving that
cover crop the chance to accumulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cover crops not going to compete
with the hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you would you would terminate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the way that cover crops are
grown ahead of corn or soybean beans,
[SPEAKER_00]: corn is a little bit more sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you terminate the cover crop typically
before you plant the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soybeans are less sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some growers are going into this this
program where they plant green,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that they don't kill the cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just plant the soybeans directly into
it and let the soybeans emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they come back and kill the cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's just going towards
accumulating the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be enough biomass for that
cover crop to suppress the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just trying to give the cover
crop a little bit of extra time after
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something similar would have to be done
with hemp where you would kill the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and we have a roller crimper planter
where we can terminate the cover crop by
[SPEAKER_00]: basically mashing it down and creating a
mat of residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll plant the crop into that and
clear spaces for the crop seeds to emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then between the crop rows,
we rely on the cover crop to suppress the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what other what other tools are
available to kind of help control weeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, going back to using hemp in a
rotational strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I meant to come back to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's a lot of potential
because the work that we've that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: done, that my lab has done, has shown that
some of our our our driver weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most problematic species, don't emerge
well from hemp residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a system in in management of
other crops called chaff lining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can think about a combine moving
across the field and harvesting soybeans,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the combine is collecting the soybean
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then out the back of the combine,
all the residue, the crop residue,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stems, all the other materials
material is being deposited back on the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Australian farmers came up with this
really neat system where they take the
[SPEAKER_00]: finest particles of that crop and they
funnel it into a line in the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only is it the the finest
particles of the crop, but it's also the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they deposit the weed seeds in this
crop residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this this pile of biomass in a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have precision planting
technology, then you make those lines
[SPEAKER_00]: after every crop in the same place every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're always putting your weed seeds
back in a line in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the the great thing is
they're they're going to be there so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do other management practices on
top of that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've concentrated them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that you're preventing them from
germinating so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hemp, on the other hand, if you were
to use hemp in a chaff lining strategy and
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the biochemical properties of the
hemp biomass, there might be the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: to suppress the germination of those weeds
because of the biochemistry of that crop
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing that my lab has
conceptually looked at and a way that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think hemp could actually be a positive a
driver in creating a more sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: rotational system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're kind of having all the waste
from from the previous harvest in these
[SPEAKER_01]: lines, and that includes the weeds and the
seeds and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically, those weeds will germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with hemp, they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found in chaff lining systems
in general, we had hoped that the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: would decay more quickly because you're
putting them in biomass where microbes are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be working harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't see them decaying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually see that that biomass protects
the seeds and they can remain viable for
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not what we had hoped.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least we can show that we're
concentrating the seeds in one location.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we concentrate them in hemp biomass,
then then, yes, we do see a suppressive
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of the hemp mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long it will last.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the amount of rainfall and
microbial action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rainfall and temperature would be
major.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drivers of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, there's the potential to get
a little bit of added benefit from
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression of those biochemicals found in
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back to crop rotation,
would hemp be a good candidate crop to be
[SPEAKER_01]: rotating with your your soybeans or your
corn or things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think it's still unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the corn herbicides may be a
little bit hard on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you rotate from corn to hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's something that we've
we've seen observationally, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: really quantified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be some rotational issues
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes back to, you know,
if you really got the hemp established,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could get a really good suppressive
year where you didn't have a lot of weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a form of seed bank control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these summer annual plants that are
problems that are weeds in our in our corn
[SPEAKER_00]: and soybean systems, their strategy is
just to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a summer annual produces seeds,
then it's basically one for that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could possibly reduce seed
production if we can get a suppressive
[SPEAKER_00]: stand of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then any seeds that are produced could
be lined in a chaff lining system
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of questions as far as
rotational strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's unknown as far as
the number of pathogens that the crops may
[SPEAKER_00]: share in rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if we know which crop
should follow which right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what the best temporal rotation
really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know there are other people working
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, hopefully one day we'll have
an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about mulching or plastic covering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that does that help as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's one of the the more common
ways that I see floral hemp produced in
[SPEAKER_00]: our local geography is with plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that in itself can have some
environmental sustainability implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any sort of material that could be
mulched with, so even an organic mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: material that could suppress the weeds,
that would be very helpful as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my research, I will confess,
I am not a cultivation expert,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what is integrating weed management?
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that is that's the the focus of my
lab, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad I asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of work with herbicide
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I study herbicide efficacy and the
way that we should use herbicides in our
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping systems to control weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the evolution of
herbicide resistance and the increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: cases, it's very clear that we're putting
herbicides under a lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So herbicide or weeds are evolving
herbicide resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really faster than we can create
new herbicides at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So integrated weed management is the idea
that you you should develop a more
[SPEAKER_00]: diversified strategy for weed control and
you should put more pressures on the weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: besides just herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with, you know,
microbial resistance to antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same type of selection that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can put in cover crops and and
harvest weed seed control tactics like
[SPEAKER_00]: chaff lining, like I was mentioning,
you know, if we can build an ecologically
[SPEAKER_00]: robust system where we have seed
predators, you know, insects in the field
[SPEAKER_00]: that are eating seeds and we can,
you know, capitalize more on some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological interactions that are
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then then that integrated system,
you can still use herbicides, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting less pressure on the herbicides
and you're probably at some point you're
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning to slow the evolution of
herbicide resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it seems like herbicides are really
the the short term solution, but with
[SPEAKER_01]: really potentially severe long term
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, and it's it partly goes
back to the need to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: financially sustainable in the short term
and, you know, learning to manage other
[SPEAKER_00]: tactics, like learning to manage cover
crops in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, in a way, learning to manage a
whole new crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're increasing the complexity of the
system, whereas herbicides are a
[SPEAKER_00]: simplified strategy, but they're they come
with a prescription, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when to apply them, you know, what to
apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you're relatively guaranteed to
some degree a success if you do things in
[SPEAKER_00]: the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start adding all of these
other tactics in, then some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions become less predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that the yields can be less
predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a farmer who's maybe not as
comfortable financially, it can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to take those risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so there's a lot to the conversation as
far as, you know, the adoption of more
[SPEAKER_00]: ecologically based practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be really risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially with hemp, too,
I think a lot of people got into hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: production, particularly for CBD,
assuming that there is going to be this
[SPEAKER_01]: huge market for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was kind of overproduction
in the the prices really fell through the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely a consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for our growers here locally,
there are a lot of folks that are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in growing fiber and
potentially seed crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the market is still not
there to support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can experiment on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not going to be, you know,
a lot of potential for that that return on
[SPEAKER_00]: investment right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it is definitely the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, not to put you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't want to answer this,
we can certainly cut it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why do you think that other types or
other commodities associated with hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: really haven't taken off yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really has been focused primarily on
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it seems like it's kind of a chicken
and the egg type scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in order to have a market that's
built around a commodity, you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmer that's going to produce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in order for the farmer to produce
it, that person has to have a place to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it after they produce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, I think, more of a question of
establishing some of these basic market
[SPEAKER_00]: initiatives across a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you if you're a processor, if you want
to establish a processing facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means, you know, two years ahead of
your facility, you're already reaching out
[SPEAKER_00]: and contracting up to a thousand acres of
production with local growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're working with them so that
they understand how to grow the crop and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're providing some agronomic oversight
while you're building your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything comes online and then
you have your growers contracted and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have your product coming in and then you
just continue to build capacity after
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not it's not just like building a
facility and then it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a knowledgeable grower
base to go along with that to for that to
[SPEAKER_00]: be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that is a great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So winding down here and you've touched on
it already, but I want to give you another
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you working on now and what can
we expect to see in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we're continuing to be part of a
large scale cultivar trial where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: just planting different cultivars all
across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and different geographies to see what the,
you know, genetic by environmental impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: are for each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, you know, I hope that we can
identify some cultivars that do really
[SPEAKER_00]: well in southern Illinois and kind of
expand our grower options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the things that we'll
continue to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're wrapping up our critical
weed free period and management study
[SPEAKER_00]: that's funded by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the next year, I hope to have
all those data analyzed and published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd mentioned cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to establish a couple of pilot
cover crop studies just to see what that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like, because we've never really
experienced experimented with planting
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp into cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to give you a chance to share
any other resources that you think that
[SPEAKER_01]: the audience might be interested in if
they're interested to learn more about
[SPEAKER_01]: weed control and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the resources are still being
developed, so I hope that those will be
[SPEAKER_00]: shared more in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have a growing Cannabis Science
Center here at Southern Illinois
[SPEAKER_00]: University Carbondale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some resources on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them on the Cannabis Science
Center webpage, and you can see what our
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse faculty group is doing and how
we're coming together to study cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Carla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this has been fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see some more results of
what you're working on and hopefully see
[SPEAKER_01]: you up on the CanMed stage real soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.
