[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many things that still are
not known in the field of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant produces a group of compounds
called cannabinoid acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The acids were not investigated until
recently, not very thoroughly at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're not stable, they break
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical industry, the major medical
industry, want to have pure compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been investigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been thoroughly tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few years ago we decided to go ahead
and try to stabilise these acids and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were able chemically to stabilise them and
now it is possible to investigate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies that I work with, EPM,
works on the acids of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking into the activities of these
acids and they seem to be important,
[SPEAKER_00]: very important in a variety of fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chances are that here we have something
of considerable medical importance and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that there will be ways to introduce
these compounds as medical agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collaboration is absolutely a necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is a meeting now of CanMed and
EPM together and it's going to take place
[SPEAKER_00]: in Pasadena and I'm going to fly there,
try to give a general picture of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been doing and what I hope will be
done in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect to show that cannabis and
cannabinoids are not a tiny project,
[SPEAKER_00]: one compound for one disease, but to show
that it is really a very, very wide field
[SPEAKER_00]: of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need good new drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need new drugs in a huge number of
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an open field for new drugs,
new preparations and I believe that there
[SPEAKER_00]: will be a lot of work in this field over
the next decade or so, maybe two decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
