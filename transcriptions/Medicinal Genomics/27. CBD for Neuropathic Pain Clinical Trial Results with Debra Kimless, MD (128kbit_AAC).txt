[SPEAKER_00]: She is the CMO at Pure Green
Pharmaceuticals, where she oversees
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical medical testing, patient and
physician educational programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and medical product development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deb and her team recently published an
open-label clinical trial for treating
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetic neuropathic pain with a
water-soluble CBD tablet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our conversation, we discuss results
from that clinical trial, what makes
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetic neuropathic pain a good candidate
for cannabinoid therapies, comparing the
[SPEAKER_00]: adverse effects of standard DNP treatments
to CBD, the advantages of delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids via a water-soluble tablet,
why there are not more clinical trials
[SPEAKER_00]: into cannabinoids, into cannabinoid
therapies, and tools consumers can use to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify proper clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to that conversation,
I would like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Pure Green Pharmaceuticals.

[SPEAKER_00]: Deborah Kimlis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Deb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always great to catch up with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you a lot out on the conference
circuit, you being a frequent presenter
[SPEAKER_00]: and a very good one, a former CanMed
presenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, given the circumstances,
we haven't been out there on the circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to maybe ask you, how has not
going to conferences and kind of being out
[SPEAKER_00]: there kind of helped you, I don't know,
maybe refocus or concentrate more on other
[SPEAKER_00]: work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this whole COVID pandemic
shutdown thing has been kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: double-edged sword.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the good part about not having
to travel outside of your home is that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot of time to dedicate to doing
all kinds of different projects and no
[SPEAKER_02]: excuses for not doing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the bad part is, one,
you miss that collaboration, that
[SPEAKER_02]: face-to-face time with people where a
simple hello could lead down a path of a
[SPEAKER_02]: great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the challenge is trying to recreate
that in creative ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the internet was a positive
regarding that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these podcasts are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think when it comes to face-to-face
time with people, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as humans, we're meant to be social
creatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that part's been kind of
challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get a lot of work done, though,
staying home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the challenge with that also is when
to shut down, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: your workspace and your home space become
sort of one in an amorphous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you definitely need to keep that
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make a great point about sort of
the collaboration and being in-person with
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thankfully, it seems like there's more
in-person events being announced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we're planning to hold
CanMed this fall out there in Pasadena.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, fingers crossed that
everything keeps trending in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: direction, and we'll get to talk to each
other in person pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then, we get to talk on the
podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to talk with you about a
new clinical trial that you guys just
[SPEAKER_00]: published about, where you were looking
into treating diabetic neuropathic pain
[SPEAKER_00]: with CBD, which is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe the best place to start is to
kind of let's talk about what exactly is
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetic peripheral neuropathy,
and why do you think that would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: target?
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabinoid therapies?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, this was an incredible
opportunity to do this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: We chose diabetic peripheral neuropathy
because it's kind of a nerve damage caused
[SPEAKER_02]: by diabetes, elevated chronic elevation of
blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's quite debilitating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it leads to numbness, loss of
sensation, pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually they call this stalking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a stalking glove distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's in their people's feet and legs
and hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sadly, it's the most common
complication of diabetes and affects
[SPEAKER_02]: upwards of 50% of patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why did, yeah, I know it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why do we think it was a great target
or potential target to explore is because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of basic science research.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, super smart people are creating
these animal models to look at different
[SPEAKER_02]: types of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a basic science research
that shows in a glycine induced
[SPEAKER_02]: neuropathic pain model that CBD seemed to
have had a reduction in pain in this
[SPEAKER_02]: model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah Jane Ward at a Temple University,
my mentor and somebody I admire hugely,
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at CBD to prevent or reduce
Paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathic
[SPEAKER_02]: pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so diabetes, because it's rampant and
widespread and is so debilitating with
[SPEAKER_02]: this painful thing, we thought this would
be an interesting target for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like there was already some
groundwork laid through others who had
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of been investigating this at a more
plant model level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I have that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not plant, I'm sorry, animal, animal
model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like plants, but yes, definitely
at the animal, you know, benchtop model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also a lot of what people like
to sort of turn their nose at,
[SPEAKER_02]: but anecdotal evidence clinically where
people seem to respond to cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: broadly in CBD specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought that we would take a look at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are some of the common
medications used to treat DPN?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what are their side
effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that another reason that cannabinoids
might be a good candidate here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the, well, the main treatment
is to try to get some tight control with
[SPEAKER_02]: blood sugar to try to prevent it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, sometimes it's a challenge,
especially if people don't eat right and
[SPEAKER_02]: don't understand what the mechanisms are
of why they have diabetes and how to
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent therefore those spikes of blood
sugar and the chronicity of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the only two FDA approved drugs are
Lyrica or pregabalin and Cymbalta,
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise known as deloxetine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're tough drugs to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and they have a ton of side
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something is, you know, minor until it
affects you is dizziness and nausea and
[SPEAKER_02]: extreme fatigue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have weight gain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have amnesia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can affect your platelets.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can cause heart failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're getting into some, you know,
more serious of these side effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these also carry a black box warning
of suicide and suicidal ideation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I mean, you always as a
physician want to balance efficacy of a
[SPEAKER_02]: drug with side effects, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what good is it if something works
if at the end of the day, it makes you
[SPEAKER_02]: kill yourself?
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and as we in the cannabinoid or
endocannabinoid industry have come to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn is that for the most part,
when taken prudently, cannabinoids don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, have serious adverse effects or
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one thing that you mentioned there
about sort of what causes this pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure that I
understood that correctly is, is it
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's caused by, you know,
for lack of a better term, like poor
[SPEAKER_00]: management of diet or blood sugar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that can be prevented if
folks are managing things properly?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it depends, I guess,
on what that management looks like,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are someone who eats garbage and
just takes a pill to sort of counteract
[SPEAKER_02]: that, I think that the glycosylation of
these nerves is what's happening that
[SPEAKER_02]: leads to this damage of the nerve,
of these peripheral nerves will continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've read studies that even slightly
elevated, but chronic slight elevation of
[SPEAKER_02]: blood sugar can also lead to these
neuropathic pain issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really it's, it's got to be looked at
in a more holistic way where you take
[SPEAKER_02]: charge of what, what you eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I take care of patients who
are tired of, of having diabetes and
[SPEAKER_02]: taking medication, I transition them to a
whole food, all plant, no added,
[SPEAKER_02]: oil, no processed food diet to help manage
their diabetes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the majority of, of my type two
diabetics are able to reduce or replace
[SPEAKER_02]: all of their medicines just by diet alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because they're not spiking their
blood sugar and sort of creating this
[SPEAKER_00]: nerve damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's weird because, you know,
when in medical school, we're taught about
[SPEAKER_02]: diabetes being a problem with blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of like a, an end result,
but really the primary result is diabetes
[SPEAKER_02]: is because fat blocks insulin's ability to
take sugar that we need to have for a
[SPEAKER_02]: function and energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our brain functions on glucose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you don't need glucose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need it in a wholesome way,
not in a refined sugar kind of way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the real cause of diabetes for people
who are predisposed to having this is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that fat inside a cell blocks insulin's
ability to bring sugar in for metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because of that, then you see a
blood, a blood sugar spike in your blood
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's in your blood and not in the
cells where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've sort of set the table
there, so what were the results of your
[SPEAKER_00]: study?
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and yeah, I mean, so, so we had 31
subjects with diabetes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was an open label, meaning I knew
that they had the drug that they were
[SPEAKER_02]: getting CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew that they were getting CBD and
we had them use a smartphone app.
[SPEAKER_02]: We designed a series of questions,
looking at a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_02]: endpoints.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is of course, safety, you know,
to make sure that, that this preparation
[SPEAKER_02]: was safe with no adverse events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second is efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what was the pain scale score?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it go down and was it statistically
significant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer was yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because this was an, an open label,
I didn't have anyone get off their Lyrica
[SPEAKER_02]: or symbolic label.
[SPEAKER_02]: Valta or any of the off label medications
that are often used or prescribed for this
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they're, they qualify with a
pain scale score, an MPR score from zero
[SPEAKER_02]: to 10 of a five or greater, then they made
the grade and they can be on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in spite of the fact that they
were still taking these meds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had, you know, more subjects on
these pain meds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still with an average pain scale score of
close to seven on medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we even compared it with patients who
weren't on these medicines with their
[SPEAKER_02]: average pain scale score close to seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they both statistically significantly
dropped by almost half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and when you look at NPRS score and
something like diabetic neuropathic pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's something called what is minimally
clinically significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what makes patients say that was worth
my while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally speaking, they, you know,
an NPRS of a reduction of two points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is clinically significant for patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were down by three as an average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, I was going to ask you about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I was reading through the,
the, the study there, the results were
[SPEAKER_00]: presented as an average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any participants who had a
reduction of pain so much that it was zero
[SPEAKER_00]: or is that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these results were incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and the results were robust enough
for us to say, what if we do this again,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we do it with a placebo control,
double blind randomized trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And literally last week, we just closed
out 51 subjects, double blind randomized
[SPEAKER_02]: trial, placebo controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's the data sets are with the
statisticians.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we wait.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, no indication or any idea of how
the data looks or.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is an indication for a
statistically significant reduction in
[SPEAKER_02]: pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we took people off their payments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's, that's certainly
significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go ahead and start people,
the smart statisticians to get their hands
[SPEAKER_02]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a, you know, another story for
another podcast, hopefully, and another
[SPEAKER_02]: manuscript.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, there are, you know, there are,
um, some indications that show similar
[SPEAKER_02]: type results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's certainly remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that I read,
um, in the study is that I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if I read a curriculum, you could
certainly tell me, um, that some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: participants actually wanted to stop using
their medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I think, um, we, you advise them
not to just because, um, under the terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the study, like you said, you wanted to
keep them, um, you know, consistent or
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them on the medications consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which certainly makes sense,
but I was curious that now with that study
[SPEAKER_00]: over, do you know how, did any of those
participants actually stop using their
[SPEAKER_00]: medications?
[SPEAKER_02]: So good question because we're a clinical
trials company per se, there's no,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not patients of ours, you know,
so there, we don't follow up beyond,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what, what our, our protocol is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know that, but I would imagine
if I were one of those patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly would, would replace my,
um, medications or augment my medications
[SPEAKER_02]: with CBD after there was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if for no other reason than,
uh, what we've touched on before that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some of those side effects from
those other medications are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: insignificant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, conversely, I read also in your
study that none of the participants
[SPEAKER_00]: reported any adverse, excuse me,
reported any adverse events from the CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I have to think that, um,
that's very uncommon in a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very fair to say, I mean,
generally speaking, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's fair to say, you know, for anything
that people always have some sort of an
[SPEAKER_02]: issue with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yes, it was very rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's why, you know,
this was a really informative trial,
[SPEAKER_02]: albeit an open label.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so that's why we wanted to see
what would happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if we did this again, you know,
everybody blinded and placebo controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, kind of just going back to
the whole idea of there being no adverse
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's sort of something that
comes up a lot when I talk with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with physicians or clinicians in general
is that, you know, that's one of the great
[SPEAKER_00]: things about, about CBD or cannabinoid
therapies is that really the adverse
[SPEAKER_00]: events, the likelihood of an adverse event
is very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it's not that it's zero,
but it is so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, um, it's often a good idea to at
least try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and if it doesn't work for
you, then kind of no harm, no foul.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, that's one thing about
cannabinoid therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, um, pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it like the therapeutic order of
operations, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, you know, change your diet and
lifestyle, take away all the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: are adversely impacting your, your health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you still have a condition,
start adding on things with the least
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not saying that pharmaceuticals are
terrible, but I'm saying that there are
[SPEAKER_02]: other things, including cannabinoids that
should be tried first before we get to
[SPEAKER_02]: something, because you want to have
something that's effective with the least
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of side effects.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd sort of, I'm curious to
talk with you about sort of the medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, um, that you were using to treat
these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if I understand correctly,
the CBD treatment you studied was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: in a tablet form, which kind of struck me
as rather rare for cannabis treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, there's oral ingestibles of
all sorts, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the owner of the company, PG Pharma had
the idea that he wanted to create a
[SPEAKER_02]: administration form that doctors would be
comfortable with and familiar with,
[SPEAKER_02]: patients would be comfortable with and
familiar with, that it would be an ease of
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would be able to titrate it,
you know, up or down, depending upon the
[SPEAKER_02]: effects of the, of the, of the medicine on
the indication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, it's rare that it's a water
solubilized iteration of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes under your tongue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It rapidly dissolves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, lots and lots of people
use a sublingual version that's oil-based
[SPEAKER_02]: and dropper-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this was formulated in a tablet
form to, to look familiar and feel
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar and, and look like real medicine
that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was something that came up when I
was talking with Dr. Peter Grinspoon on an
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was pretty adamant that, you know,
if we want cannabis to be treated like a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, it should look like a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to be sort of treating
conditions with, with gummy bears or
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, it just doesn't,
it doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think moving more towards a
traditional look would certainly help at
[SPEAKER_00]: least with adoption from folks who are
maybe not as comfortable with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I always say, I don't like to
vilify any cannabinoid, nor do I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: vilify any administration form for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can assure you that as a physician,
I've never written a prescription for a
[SPEAKER_02]: brownie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if that's the only way someone
with horrific anxiety, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: will take a cannabinoid, and that
cannabinoid seems to work for that
[SPEAKER_02]: anxiety, I'm just using as an example,
then gosh, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but there are a subset of people
who look at cannabis and think of it as,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, something that, you know,
stoners use and they think it's only about
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking and there's no way they would ever
use this, you know, without remembering
[SPEAKER_02]: that this was in the U S pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up until the early 1940s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my grandfather, a pharmacist probably,
you know, had alcohol extractions and
[SPEAKER_02]: tinctures of cannabinoids on his shelf
that he gave people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, everyone, I think the beauty
of this industry is that there's something
[SPEAKER_02]: for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if somebody's inclination is to
say, I want to get closest to the plan as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible and feels that vaporizing or
inhalation of some sort is, is the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: go, then, and it works fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if somebody wants to say,
I'm not really excited about that method
[SPEAKER_02]: of administration, these sublingual
tablets make the most sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, I'm, I'm, we're right there for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think at the end of the day,
we want to, um, we want to make this as
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: To as many different people as possible.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's what we want for the
medical industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, just based on the safety
profile and the, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and potential efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more about, um, this tablet and what
you used in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I understand it was, it was CBD,
but I was curious, were there any other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids or terpenoids sort of in that
formulation or was it just CBD only?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a proprietary blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can't disclose, but it had curated
terpenes and, uh, some secret sauce and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I guess the obligatory
question about the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I take it that if there are other
cannabinoids, interpenoids in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: then, um, it's certainly playing a role,
at least, um, in the benefits here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we, we can all agree about the
synergistic effects, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: reign supreme, even in traditional
medicine, you know, as an
[SPEAKER_02]: anesthesiologist, we would use a bunch of
different medications to, um, induce
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody in, you know, for general
anesthesia, as opposed to one medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: just use a whole lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, to reduce side effects of one
medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: So synergistic effects of, of different
molecules make a lot of sense and have
[SPEAKER_02]: always made a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I kind of struggle with if you have an
oral ingestible, you know, what happens in
[SPEAKER_02]: the stomach when, you know, it's a pH of
less than two and, um, hydrochloric acid
[SPEAKER_02]: is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes through the digestive
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think about, you know, we eat a lot
of terpenes all day long in fruits and
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables and herbs and spices.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if in that method of
administration, if it matters as much as
[SPEAKER_02]: it would with inhalation, like
aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a sublingual where you, where you,
it is potentially absorbed into the
[SPEAKER_02]: systemic circulation, bypassing that,
that GI tract in that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolism piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is, that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't really struck me until you,
you mentioned it that, um, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we are ingesting all different types
of foods that have different terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: different compounds in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we, if we all agree that there is
an entourage effect going on here,
[SPEAKER_00]: how could, you know, eating an edible
after you eat a cheeseburger different
[SPEAKER_00]: than, be different than if you ate it
after you had a salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, something I had never considered
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or augmented better with a salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's just say the salad had some
kind of olive oil on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people aren't saying, you know,
to themselves, listening to this podcast,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, it's the fat content of the
cheeseburger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, disclosure, I'm not
advising a cheeseburger, but that content
[SPEAKER_02]: of the cheeseburger that allows for better
absorption of the terpenes and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, but still, I think we can agree
that, you know, cannabis is a very
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient manufacturer of terpenes and
other plant sources have a greater amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet, you know, I just don't know,
you know, this is something that keeps me
[SPEAKER_02]: up at night and someday I would love to
run, you know, clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody wants to fund me doing this,
you know, looking exactly at the context
[SPEAKER_02]: of this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I hear a lot talking to
folks in this field, which, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: is always exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, if nothing else,
it's job security, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and on the, and on the topic of
clinical trials, you know, another thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that always comes up when I talk with
people about cannabis and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is, you know, we need more
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so now you've completed one here and
you have another double blind study in the
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, why do you feel like there aren't more
clinical trials being done now?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one, they're difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be clever enough to work
around the legal and regulatory landscape
[SPEAKER_02]: in using a federally illegal substance,
you know, and then there's COVID,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, add that to the mix and,
and I would also have, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive probably should have been number
one more than difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cause there's always ways and of
figuring stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I did it, you know, I'm sure other
people can too, but it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about it, you know,
for the most part, universities don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to touch it because of federal funding and
they're, they're nervous about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anytime you onboard a university,
generally speaking, it becomes very
[SPEAKER_02]: cumbersome and a lot of right tape,
um, and businesses who are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating processing and selling on a,
on a retail sales landscape are busy doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to monetize a clinical
trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, pure green pharmaceuticals in the
midst of, of, uh, trying to fundraise to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to take these, this, these pieces
of information that we're getting to the
[SPEAKER_02]: FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get an IND to make, make a true
pharmaceutical, you know, no differently
[SPEAKER_02]: than GW Pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: People generally don't put their money
where their mouth is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's unfortunate, but it's,
it's encouraging at least that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're managing to get it done and we
are seeing more or come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so hopefully that's a, that's a trend
that continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, PG Pharma is, um,
was self-funded by the CEO for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then through connections in the
largesse of an investment company at a
[SPEAKER_02]: Pennsylvania, go figure, um, who believed
in, you know, making real medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in terms of clinical trials,
like, are there, are there certain
[SPEAKER_00]: standards that must be met to kind of
perform like a quote unquote proper
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trial in terms of sample size,
selection criteria, time period,
[SPEAKER_00]: or things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I ask because, uh, I mean, unfortunately
in this space and I imagine in any space,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's sort of, there's pseudoscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, um, maybe some less
scrupulous studies that are out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: folks might tout as being a quote unquote
clinical trial, but maybe aren't,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, as robust as, as, uh, as a proper
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if so, are there some sort of
like red flags that consumers might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to kind of look for if, if there are
folks claiming to have performed a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trial?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for sure there is, I like the term
proper, proper clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are rules that govern and
standards that govern what a clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: trial is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people go to school for years and
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I studied past an exam and I'm actually a
certified principal investigator as well
[SPEAKER_02]: as my other, um, my other initials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have CPI going for me and you know,
it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, sample size is calculated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called power through smart
statisticians looking at what the end
[SPEAKER_02]: points are and what the, what kinds of
results you want to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and you need to have this gone
through like a, uh, investigators review
[SPEAKER_02]: board to make sure that it's ethical and
that somebody independent is sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: overseeing what the, what the protocol is,
that there's informed consent to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that subjects are protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their rights are protected, their health
in the event of an adverse event,
[SPEAKER_02]: or even just publishing any of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so there's a site called
clinical trials.gov.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, um, actually overseen by the
NIH national, national Institute of
[SPEAKER_02]: health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of our tax dollars are paying for
this, that true robust clinical trials
[SPEAKER_02]: have to list on that site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is probably one of the harder things
I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've studied for board certifications
for many, many different medical,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, specialties and, and it's really
challenging to do this, but every one of
[SPEAKER_02]: our trials is list is IRB approved and
listed on clinical trials.gov.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see those trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can Google it, Google, you know,
my last name, and you can see a list of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of trials that, you know, we've got IRB
approval for, and we're just waiting for
[SPEAKER_02]: funding or we've completed, or we're in
the midst of recruiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be something that,
um, patients, if they're interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at can also see, but most of these
manufacturers are not doing these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of these publications are not in
a peer review medical journal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's kind of like a buyer be
aware as well, and not to suggest that the
[SPEAKER_02]: information that manufacturers garner from
patients, they use their products is not
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly is, but there's a difference
between you know, a patient survey and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a real robust clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that clinical trials.gov.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's a great resource,
um, to certainly, um, maybe vet some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these, these things, or some of these
claims, or maybe just to, to keep an eye
[SPEAKER_00]: on what clinical trials are being done in
the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll definitely provide a link to that
in the show notes so that people can check
[SPEAKER_00]: that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess wrapping up here, um,
I wanted to give you an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: plug any, um, any websites, any social
media, anything that you would like to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to let people know about so they can
maybe learn more about the work you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, or maybe connect with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So absolutely go on to pgpharma.co,
especially if you're an investor in this
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that is excited about creating,
you know, FDA approved pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, like we, you know,
with a shout out to what we said before,
[SPEAKER_02]: some people would only take what they
consider to be the gold standard of
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine, which is, you know, found in a
pharmacy, FDA approved with a thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're trying to create.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pgpharma.co has, has all the links to,
you know, Instagram or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can go onto clinical trials.gov
and see what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our journal article is a journal
of, of diabetes and metabolism where you
[SPEAKER_02]: can read the full journal.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I will provide links to each of
those resources in the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just easy for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people to, um, to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Deb, thanks again for, for joining
us here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do hope I get to see you in person
later this year.
