[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like to say thank you to
Medicinal Genomics for bringing us all
[SPEAKER_07]: together.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that the pandemic has been a little
wonky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the whole world has gone wonky
on us lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like to thank our panelists
for being here today and making this
[SPEAKER_07]: journey.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are in a wonky world, and I would
invite you to think about our colleagues,
[SPEAKER_07]: friends, and family who are undergoing
some challenges in Eastern Europe these
[SPEAKER_07]: days.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you have time later in the day,
just take a moment, pause, and give them
[SPEAKER_07]: some thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have the opportunity that we
all have right now today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my heart goes out to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So regulating cannabis is not
straightforward, and it is most definitely
[SPEAKER_07]: not consistent across North America and
definitely not within the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: As individual states are slowly,
and I do mean slowly, and independently
[SPEAKER_07]: legalizing cannabis, it's often defined as
hemp, marijuana, cannabis, all of this
[SPEAKER_07]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mentioned to somebody yesterday that
cannabis is still in its infancy stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't even identified our vocabulary
yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the regulating bodies and other
interested parties have one goal in mind,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that is to ensure consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one central thought and one
central objective to all of the parties.
[SPEAKER_07]: Working together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And without getting into the history of
the legalizations or the lessons learned
[SPEAKER_07]: or the lessons not learned thus far on the
pathways forward, I am delighted to
[SPEAKER_07]: introduce to you today, today's panel that
represents regulations and mostly around
[SPEAKER_07]: laboratory testing and a snapshot into the
science that's been diligently working
[SPEAKER_07]: towards catching up to regulations as well
as representation from the national safety
[SPEAKER_07]: council, which is a nonprofit agency
centralized on consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many of you here have heard of the
national safety council?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not too many people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold that thought, and you're going to
hear more about that later.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm delighted to introduce you to
today's panelists.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one here is Kay Doyle.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is the director of U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Public Policy and Legal Council for Jazz
Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Prior to her tenure at Jazz, Kay was one
of the inaugural cannabis control
[SPEAKER_07]: commissioners for the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and she was charged with
[SPEAKER_07]: implementing the programs for adult use
and medicinal use of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: and she's living to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kay also served as the primary counsel for
the medical use marijuana program,
[SPEAKER_07]: food protection program, tobacco control
program for Massachusetts Department of
[SPEAKER_07]: Public Health.
[SPEAKER_07]: She has also taught marijuana policy and
law as an adjunct professor for the New
[SPEAKER_07]: England School of Law.
[SPEAKER_07]: And prior to a public service,
Kay practiced land use and civil rights
[SPEAKER_07]: law litigating in state and federal trial
appellate courts, including the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right next to Kay is Katie Mueller,
who represents the national safety council
[SPEAKER_07]: as the senior program manager of the
impairment practice.
[SPEAKER_07]: She brings 15 years of experience in
public safety program planning and project
[SPEAKER_07]: management, public policy creation and
communications, traffic safety focus on
[SPEAKER_07]: impaired driving, occupant protection and
community outreach, and education.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I mentioned, many of you folks here are
not familiar with NSC, so very quickly it
[SPEAKER_07]: was established in 1923 to advocate for
workplace and roadway safety.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2021, NSC members initiated research
into a cannabis impairment division
[SPEAKER_07]: through the Division of Alcohol and Drugs
Cannabis Division, but you'll hear more on
[SPEAKER_07]: that from Katie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next to Katie is Jenny Wong, who is the
assistant branch chief of the California
[SPEAKER_07]: Department of Cannabis Control She has
worked in the health and safety field for
[SPEAKER_07]: 13 years with specialized experience in
food safety, drinking water safety,
[SPEAKER_07]: and environmental compliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Following her career as a health inspector
for the L.A.
[SPEAKER_07]: County Public Health Department,
she expanded her purview to manage the
[SPEAKER_07]: environmental health, environmental
compliance, and occupational safety
[SPEAKER_07]: programs for the UCLA Office of
Environment, Health and Safety.
[SPEAKER_07]: She now brings her experience to support
the licensed cannabis industry by building
[SPEAKER_07]: compliance structures for the cultivation
and manufacturing licensees across the
[SPEAKER_07]: state.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's also living to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heather Krug is the state cannabis science
program manager for the Colorado
[SPEAKER_07]: Department of Public Health and
Environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: She has served in this role since 2014.
[SPEAKER_07]: The program includes three sections.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cannabis laboratory certification
sections performs audits of Colorado,
[SPEAKER_07]: retail, medical, marijuana testing,
facilities and hemp testing labs for
[SPEAKER_07]: compliance and suitability for
certification under state rec.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's also responsible for the cannabis
reference laboratory, which develops
[SPEAKER_07]: methods and test cannabis products for
compliance and public health
[SPEAKER_07]: investigations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heather also oversees the marijuana health
monitoring and research section,
[SPEAKER_07]: which monitors marijuana use patterns and
health impacts across the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: The section evaluates and summarizes
existing and emerging scientific evidence
[SPEAKER_07]: about potential effects of marijuana use
and administers to research grant
[SPEAKER_07]: programs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Using the data information generated by
the program, Heather advises state
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis policy and regulatory decisions,
and she holds a bachelor's science degree
[SPEAKER_07]: in biomedical science and a master of
science degree in forensic toxicology.
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, at the end, certainly not
least, is Dr. Sheram Holm, who is the
[SPEAKER_07]: director of regulatory affairs at
Medicinal Genomics, and they are marketing
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics-based cannabis tests and breeding
technologies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sheram has received his Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_07]: in microbiology at the University of
California, or at Davis, in a postdoc
[SPEAKER_07]: training in molecular genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: His primary responsibility at Medicinal
Genomics is to make recommendations to
[SPEAKER_07]: regulatory officials that are tasked with
either drafting and or modifying cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: hemp and psychedelic mushroom required
microbial testing regs to ensure safe
[SPEAKER_07]: products for patients and consumers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Previously, he was at the department of
New Jersey Department of Health and Public
[SPEAKER_07]: Health and Environmental Labs,
where he led teams that started the
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis Testing Lab, the Cannabis
Microbial Testing Unit, and created a
[SPEAKER_07]: compendium of all state medical cannabis
required testing regulations database.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's our panel, and as for me,
among other hats, I serve as the science
[SPEAKER_07]: advisor to the Cannabis Analytical Science
Program, which is the cannabis division of
[SPEAKER_07]: AOAC International, which is an
independent, non-profit, non-governmental
[SPEAKER_07]: science organization that's been vetting
and publishing testing standards for more
[SPEAKER_07]: than 130 years, and the CASP is very
exciting, and on behalf of the AOAC team,
[SPEAKER_07]: we welcome the input and engagement of
scientists, laboratories, and governmental
[SPEAKER_07]: agencies, several of whom are on the panel
today, and we're gonna start with the
[SPEAKER_07]: panel discussion with some questions,
and then open the floor to questions from
[SPEAKER_07]: the audience, and I invite your engagement
and look forward to some dynamic
[SPEAKER_07]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we think about where are we today
and what are we doing, I have a question
[SPEAKER_07]: for Jenny, what regulatory checkpoints
exist to protect consumer safety?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: On behalf of the, speaking for the
Department of Cannabis Control in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, we've built in a lot of the
safety and regulatory checkpoints into our
[SPEAKER_02]: auditing and inspection program for our
licensed facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I oversee the inspection program for the
cultivation facilities throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: state, as well as the LA and Central
California manufacturing licensees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look at things like you would
imagine for an audit or a health and
[SPEAKER_02]: safety inspection.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look for things like master
manufacturing protocols, other good
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing practices, SOPs,
solvent purity, and food safety when the
[SPEAKER_02]: facility is creating edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look at various health and safety
checkpoints in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our team of environmental scientists does
a really detailed audit, because knowing
[SPEAKER_02]: that a large portion of the public that
consumes these products are patients and
[SPEAKER_02]: may have compromised immune systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we keep that in mind when we're doing
these really detailed inspections.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the cultivation sites, we look for
pesticides to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides are on an approved list and
they're not banned pesticides or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the list that they've declared at
licensure matches what we find on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of different regulatory
checkpoints there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If and when we find deficiencies,
depending on the severity, we use a
[SPEAKER_02]: progressive discipline process,
working closely with licensees,
[SPEAKER_02]: unless it's an immediate danger to life
and health.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a contaminated product,
we can initiate a recall process,
[SPEAKER_02]: which happened recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had our first mandatory recall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we worked really closely with our
licensees who acted really swiftly with us
[SPEAKER_02]: to recall the products.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's something that's an immediate
danger to occupational safety,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, like an unregistered
extraction unit that may be a combustion
[SPEAKER_02]: risk, we work with fire departments to
red-tag that particular piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment, make sure it's not being used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's more on the serious violation
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's more minor or moderate,
like they didn't post their license in a
[SPEAKER_02]: visible area, of course, it's just a
matter of just a notification to the
[SPEAKER_02]: licensee saying, you need to post your
license.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you very much, Jenny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like you guys are busy out there in
DCC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heather, question for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have representation from two different
states.
[SPEAKER_07]: California and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell us what CANRA is?
[SPEAKER_07]: And what are the objectives of that
organization?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: CANRA is the Cannabis Regulators
Association.
[SPEAKER_05]: And currently, CANRA has about 40
different member states, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: So essentially, every state that has
legalized cannabis in some form,
[SPEAKER_05]: primarily medical or adult use,
but agencies that have hemp programs are
[SPEAKER_05]: also represented within CANRA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's nice about CANRA is the primary
regulatory body is usually the main
[SPEAKER_05]: member.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if your state chooses to have full
membership in CANRA, any of your state
[SPEAKER_05]: agencies that touch cannabis in any way
can join in the discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even things like our Department of
Education or Department of Public Safety
[SPEAKER_05]: that, you know, just as law enforcement,
they can all be members of the
[SPEAKER_05]: organization to share information.
[SPEAKER_05]: And CANRA's main goal really is to be a
source for regulators to discuss best
[SPEAKER_05]: practices, to discuss lessons learned,
and to share, I guess, our experiences
[SPEAKER_05]: with each other in trying to regulate
cannabis so that in the end, one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: primary, you know, goals there is that
CANRA will be a forum to promote
[SPEAKER_05]: standardization and harmonization in
regulations across the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, there are challenges with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: As each state undergoes their own
lawmaking processes and regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: development processes, which is why we do
probably see so much disparity in state
[SPEAKER_05]: regs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But CANRA is this recently organized group
that is really hoping to bring some of
[SPEAKER_05]: that harmonization.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also intends to serve as a group that
can help educate others.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that could be educating federal
lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we look at, you know, possible
federal legalization, state lessons can be
[SPEAKER_05]: shared with the feds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also to be kind of, you know,
partners with industry to, again,
[SPEAKER_05]: share information both ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And learn how and understand how the
regulations really affect the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are certainly goals that,
as this is all developed, that public
[SPEAKER_05]: health and safety, consumer safety,
equity, and other things are really at the
[SPEAKER_05]: forefront of the work of CANRA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so nice to hear that states are
beginning to form and not unionize,
[SPEAKER_07]: but harmonize and centralize.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm assuming that Colorado and
California are both part of the
[SPEAKER_07]: organization.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Katie, what prompted the National
Science, I'm sorry, the National Safety
[SPEAKER_07]: Council's involvement with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the National Safety Council,
like Susan mentioned, is a 120-year-old
[SPEAKER_06]: organization focused on workforce safety,
both in the workplace and on the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as cannabis legalization began
affecting employers, we have about 53,000
[SPEAKER_06]: membership, member organizations,
and we issued a survey to them kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: asking, what are your concerns about
employees and your organizations as is
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis affecting workplace safety and
how are you addressing it?
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we heard from them was that they
needed help, they needed education,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they needed resources in order to
educate their employees and develop really
[SPEAKER_06]: evidence-based policy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we partnered with a few different
organizations to develop a project to look
[SPEAKER_06]: at how states are regulating products and
hope to come out with a resource this year
[SPEAKER_06]: really to do what Heather was talking
about and really just provide education as
[SPEAKER_06]: others are legalizing and regulating
cannabis to learn the best practices and
[SPEAKER_06]: lessons learned from other states and
organizations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have it, NSC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm expecting that we're going to have
a lot more interaction from NSC moving
[SPEAKER_07]: forward, and this will be terrific.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a really quick snapshot into
where we are and how we and where we're
[SPEAKER_07]: hoping to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now, how did we get here?
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me ask you, Kay, what were your
challenges when you were facing state
[SPEAKER_07]: regulators trying to develop a
comprehensive testing requirements?
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I am talking here today as a former
cannabis regulator rather than on behalf
[SPEAKER_10]: of my current employer, so I should make
that clear.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you speak into the mic?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Reminding me that I'm short.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we were working with the
Department of Public Health in
[SPEAKER_10]: Massachusetts in 2015, we were trying to
develop a comprehensive testing
[SPEAKER_10]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And typically, to be honest, when we were
trying to develop any kind of regulations
[SPEAKER_10]: governing cannabis, we would look to the
West and we would look to the examples
[SPEAKER_10]: that were set by Colorado and California.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very nice to be on the panel with
representatives of those two great states
[SPEAKER_10]: today.
[SPEAKER_10]: But with regard to trying to do
comprehensive testing regulations in that
[SPEAKER_10]: particular year, they were just themselves
getting into it at that time.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we were faced with was a lack of
federal resources to look at because
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis was illegal and still is at the
federal level, but also a lack of prior
[SPEAKER_10]: comprehensive regulations in the more
mature markets.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the problem that we had in addition to
the fact that we didn't have anything to
[SPEAKER_10]: copy from is that when you are looking at
policymakers who are addressing cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: regulations, not only then, but today,
their resumes look more like mine than
[SPEAKER_10]: they look like the more scientifically
oriented members of this panel or indeed
[SPEAKER_10]: the members of this audience.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are challenged not only in the fact
that we didn't have resources to draw on,
[SPEAKER_10]: but we ourselves were not conversant with
the matter that we were trying to
[SPEAKER_10]: regulate.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was extremely difficult.
[SPEAKER_10]: We needed to draw on experts within the
government itself, but then also request
[SPEAKER_10]: help from the outside organizations.
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things I would encourage
folks in the audience today is to get
[SPEAKER_10]: involved as much as you can, understanding
that your time is limited.
[SPEAKER_10]: States need to hear exactly what Heather
was referring to earlier.
[SPEAKER_10]: How the regulations are affecting
industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're seeing a problem,
please do try and explain what it is so
[SPEAKER_10]: that regulators can try to adjust it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very difficult when the stakeholders
in a particular environment are not
[SPEAKER_10]: communicating with each other and instead
are siloed.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a productive way to proceed.
[SPEAKER_10]: So to the extent you can, please provide
comment and explain to regulators where
[SPEAKER_10]: you believe that something needs to be
addressed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rather than confining your comment to
publications that we may not read.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be incredibly helpful
until such time as CANRA and other
[SPEAKER_10]: organizations like it, with the help of
National Safety Council, manage to achieve
[SPEAKER_10]: a more uniform standardized environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think communication between the
different stakeholders in this environment
[SPEAKER_10]: needs to increase.
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, we are gonna be left with this
patchwork that we currently have in the
[SPEAKER_10]: different states.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And okay, I'm just gonna follow up on one
more thing with you on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is as a regulator, from the
commission perspective, I have heard in
[SPEAKER_07]: the past about Muhammad and the mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me what might be implied by
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: That was what I was referring to with
regard to making sure you're communicating
[SPEAKER_10]: with the folks that are regulating your
environment, especially when you're
[SPEAKER_10]: dealing with new and emerging markets.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Colorado, California, and
Massachusetts, at this point in our market
[SPEAKER_10]: development, we likely have scientific
staff that can advise us and help us.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you are starting out,
like I did, not only the medical program,
[SPEAKER_10]: but the adult use program, you may not
have access to that kind of resources in
[SPEAKER_10]: the timeline that you are given,
either by the legislature or by the
[SPEAKER_10]: citizens in a ballot initiative to get
your program up and running.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is very important for the
stakeholders to come to the regulators.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't wait for them to come to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please get your thoughts on paper or by
way of testimony in front of the
[SPEAKER_10]: regulators so they can understand where
you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sherm, you are a stakeholder,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: An industry stakeholder here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what successes or challenges or both
have you had in the cannabis regulatory
[SPEAKER_07]: space?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to, first of all,
tell you a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: How difficult it was for me to make a
decision to pivot from being a public
[SPEAKER_01]: servant to being an industry stakeholder
is that I had bumped into at a conference
[SPEAKER_01]: a commissioner from a particular state in
a regulatory body, and I had some ideas or
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations for amendments to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are microbial testing rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said to this individual that there
were plenty of individuals or industry
[SPEAKER_01]: stakeholders in her state that could
advise for amendments to the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she just looked at me and she said,
you know, I don't listen to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm glad that I'm with medicinal
genomics the last year now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the challenges that I face is that
there's no federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so therefore, there's 38 sets of
required microbial testing rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one by one, I review microbial
testing rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I identify areas where we feel to make
recommendations to amend rules based on
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second challenge is to open a
dialogue, a true dialogue between our
[SPEAKER_01]: organization and the regulatory body
officials concerning our recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Concerning the successes, to be very
honest with you, for five months,
[SPEAKER_01]: I submitted public comment to various
regulatory bodies in multiple states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I heard was, and then something
happened in November, and various
[SPEAKER_01]: dialogues have been opened where we've
been able to dialogue with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A particular example in one particular
state that I read, the allowable methods,
[SPEAKER_01]: the issues, the challenges are allowable
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: What analytes to test in the action
levels?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one particular state I read,
excuse me, the allowable methods are USP
[SPEAKER_01]: 1111 and 2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do understand that at the start of
this cannabis industry, there were no
[SPEAKER_01]: standards and methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is why this was adopted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also said plating only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have five decades of experience all
the way from plating systems through QPCR
[SPEAKER_01]: and to sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, I communicated to them with
a recommendation to be open to the AOAC
[SPEAKER_01]: standards and methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: That have been certified and then the
director of that agency contacted us and
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been having open dialogue concerning
everything about their rules and that they
[SPEAKER_01]: are amending the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an example of one of our
successes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are multiple states and we've
had success in terms of opening the
[SPEAKER_01]: dialogue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you brought up AOAC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, for all of the panelists
here, well, most of the panelists here,
[SPEAKER_07]: you all have some involvement with AOAC
CASP.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shurm, what prompted you to get involved
with AOAC?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you asked me that question,
Susan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was absolutely not aware of AOAC CASP
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am glad that an industry friend of mine
alerted me to the existence of this
[SPEAKER_01]: program because I knew immediately it was
necessary standards and methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I reviewed the first year's progress
report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, I was aghast at the plan
or the three targets for the next year,
[SPEAKER_01]: the second year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with an open heart, I simply
communicated to AOAC officials that I wish
[SPEAKER_01]: to just simply have a dialogue and to
share my understanding of the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, well, the entire testing space,
but specifically microbial testing space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they agreed to the dialogue and I
simply explained who I was and what my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave them my recommendations and that
was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my shock, they invited me to be a
member of all four committees because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the breadth of knowledge that I had
accumulated at the Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I simply says, well, one is enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being a microbiologist, I joined the
microbial working group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the last two years, we've been able
to have standards and subsequently methods
[SPEAKER_01]: for the detection of the four pathogenic
strains of aspergillus as well as for
[SPEAKER_01]: shickotoxin-producing E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the clinical literature for
salmonella and the four aspergillus
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens, there are clinical cases
reported of persons utilizing cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis that have had illnesses
and also death.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heather, you're very involved with AOAC
CASP as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to ask you to answer any questions
about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as you know, that organization is
focused on establishing standard test
[SPEAKER_07]: methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you think that might affect
regulations in Colorado or on behalf of
[SPEAKER_07]: Canara or anyplace else?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think one of the reasons we got
involved with CASP was because we have
[SPEAKER_05]: seen directly the need for more
standardization in test methods across
[SPEAKER_05]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_05]: I truly think part of the issue that we
see in variability in test results between
[SPEAKER_05]: labs is because there are so many
different methodologies and
[SPEAKER_05]: inconsistencies and methods being used.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to say, though, when I'm talking
about utilizing more standard methods in
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis testing, I am not necessarily
advocating that every lab should use the
[SPEAKER_05]: exact same method.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I don't think that we want to
stifle innovation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to stifle growth in the
science.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to ensure that people are able to
do the best testing that they can to use
[SPEAKER_05]: good science.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis is complicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: It itself is a complex matrix.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have all these different
product types.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one test may not apply to
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I say that I think the development
of standard test methods is really
[SPEAKER_05]: important, again, I think that means
development of methods that have been put
[SPEAKER_05]: through a level of rigor that is perhaps
more than an individual lab can do on
[SPEAKER_05]: their own.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what AOAC does is they put out an SNPR.
[SPEAKER_05]: Different method developers can submit
methods.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be proven to meet the
requirements of that SNPR by an expert
[SPEAKER_05]: review panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the method can be published for first
action.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then before its final action,
it has to go through multi-lab studies to,
[SPEAKER_05]: again, be shown to be fit for purpose and
to be really reliable as a method.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think having those types of methods
developed, again, will overall benefit the
[SPEAKER_05]: general science and the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think as those things are developed,
and regulators can look to that process,
[SPEAKER_05]: again, of a really robust science,
then it gives regulators the ability to
[SPEAKER_05]: say, maybe, again, I hope regulators don't
say you may only do this one thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I hope that regulators will say,
this has been proven.
[SPEAKER_05]: You either need to do this, this thing
that has been proven, or you have to at
[SPEAKER_05]: least demonstrate that your process or
your method is equivalent or better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's really why I think things
like AOAC CASP are really important in the
[SPEAKER_05]: science space of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess this would go back to both
Heather, you, Heather, as well as Jenny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you see these standards as being
supporting the regulatory efforts in your
[SPEAKER_07]: respective states?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just be brief and then let Jenny
talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I think, again, if anybody's ever
participated in legislative or regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: development, what any individual person
who is involved with these things thinks
[SPEAKER_05]: may be best doesn't always mean it works
out that way in the regulatory or
[SPEAKER_05]: legislative process.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, if we want to make
evidence-based policy decisions,
[SPEAKER_05]: if we want to make things based in
science, we have to have these standards
[SPEAKER_05]: and these processes to look to.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we don't have them, then how are we
going to make those decisions?
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, it doesn't always mean that
we're going to always make the right
[SPEAKER_05]: choices in regulations or policy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, having the resource and the
data and the facts is extremely helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jenny, do you have anything to add?
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't have preview over the
laboratory side, so I'm just going to echo
[SPEAKER_02]: what Heather said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be not the same exact standards for
every method, but if it's been tested and
[SPEAKER_02]: shown that it's rigorous enough,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jenny, by the way, I understand that
the California structure recently changed
[SPEAKER_07]: from the BCC to the DCC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you very briefly talk to us about the
differences and what prompted that change?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, prior to July 12th,
there were three licensing agencies for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the BCC, the Bureau of Cannabis
Control, which oversaw distribution and
[SPEAKER_02]: retail licenses, CalCannabis, which was
under CDFA, the California Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Food and Agriculture, which oversaw
cultivation, and My Legacy Agency,
[SPEAKER_02]: was CDPH, and I was from the Manufactured
Cannabis Safety Branch, and we oversaw the
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come July 12th, we consolidated agencies
into the main Department of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Control to new agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was really to offer a better
regulatory structure for our licensed
[SPEAKER_02]: market, to streamline efforts,
to combine resources so that we could be
[SPEAKER_02]: more efficient and more effective as a
regulatory agency in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: That helps me understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's always a dynamic industry,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Katie, question for you, and that is,
how do we elevate safety as a priority as
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis regulations evolve?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, I think one of the key here,
I've heard everyone say it, is engaging
[SPEAKER_06]: science in the policy decision-making
process, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Engaging those individuals who are doing
the research and validating the methods in
[SPEAKER_06]: the regulatory process, or encouraging
them to be engaged.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the National Safety Council,
we did that.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, when we embarked on product
testing regulation research, we gathered a
[SPEAKER_06]: scientific advisory board of toxicologists
and microbiologists and others who were
[SPEAKER_06]: involved in the research, because we are
not researching researchers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And although we hope to come together and
have a resource that others can look to
[SPEAKER_06]: for best practices, we know that knowledge
cannot only just come from us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then look to the data.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots of great research happening
in the field, and I think that as policies
[SPEAKER_06]: are developed on the state level and on
the federal level as well, we have to
[SPEAKER_06]: utilize the data that's available and look
at the states who have learned lessons and
[SPEAKER_06]: elevated safety in their own regulatory
situation and emulate those in others.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that training is another area that
we need to prioritize, and that's worker
[SPEAKER_06]: safety training.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is training for individuals to
recognize impairment, and there are just a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of areas that workforce training,
public health training is needed as we
[SPEAKER_06]: regulate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Kay, as a former regulator,
what are some of the practices or maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: even best practices that you might
recommend to regulators who are
[SPEAKER_07]: implementing new systems or reinventing
their systems?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think we raised some of them
already on the panel, and particularly the
[SPEAKER_10]: independence of the laboratories not
having ownership in common with the people
[SPEAKER_10]: that they are testing or the entities that
they are testing, engaging with the
[SPEAKER_10]: scientific community and being open to the
kind of dialogue that Sherman was
[SPEAKER_10]: discussing earlier, and also interacting
with Canro, which was starting to become
[SPEAKER_10]: what it is now today back in 2015,
but it was very much at a seed level.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think these organizations,
as well as AOAC, are critical to
[SPEAKER_10]: regulators such as myself who do not have
a scientific background to understand what
[SPEAKER_10]: is being told to them and to try and find
a balance and create regulations that make
[SPEAKER_10]: sense prior to a centralized regulatory
authority by a science-based agency.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most people who know me know that I am
not shy about saying that some
[SPEAKER_07]: regulations, although very well intended,
are not necessarily always that practical
[SPEAKER_07]: and founded in pure empirical science.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like we're still on the
pathway forward, and we're using many
[SPEAKER_07]: resources to get there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So taking that rational approach,
looking at science and moving forward,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we've all been talking about,
this is a very dynamic system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to throw this out to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have about another 20 minutes
left in our session, and I have more
[SPEAKER_07]: questions to fire off at our panelists.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at this point, do you have any
questions that you would like to raise?
[SPEAKER_07]: Please step up to the microphone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we'll really test them, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning, and thank you for being
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a question from a laboratory's
perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time we actually test something,
it's too late to do anything about product
[SPEAKER_08]: quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm interested in where you see
laboratories fitting into Haptic,
[SPEAKER_08]: GMP, GAP, and any ancillary testing that
we could be providing that would ensure
[SPEAKER_08]: product safety and compliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to direct that to anyone in
particular, or just open it up to anybody?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, specifically on Haptic and
GMP.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would any of you folks like to?
[SPEAKER_08]: What could laboratories contribute to?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when we talk about laboratory
testing, can I ask you to qualify that for
[SPEAKER_07]: me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you mean third party independent
testing to comply with the requirements?
[SPEAKER_08]: Third party independent testing,
but any testing that would be done as part
[SPEAKER_08]: of a Haptic plan or GMP or GAP plan should
be done by an independent laboratory.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the compliance testing is different
from GMP?
Correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just as long as we're all on that same
page.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything in addition that laboratories
could do to assure that.
OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I missed the last thing you just said,
let me know, because I couldn't quite hear
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think most states allow for the
third party labs to do R&D testing for the
[SPEAKER_05]: licensing agencies, and I think that's a
big part of it in our current sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: scheme is that whether it's you as a
laboratory educating your clients on the
[SPEAKER_05]: importance of actually testing things
while they're in progress versus just only
[SPEAKER_05]: doing that required test at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we think about what GMP really is and
how that would typically go, people would
[SPEAKER_05]: really be looking a lot more at their
inputs than I think what typically happens
[SPEAKER_05]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, as regulators, our concern right is
that final product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So typically, and it varies from state to
state where you're required to test.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, our goal is that that final
product is compliant and as safe as
[SPEAKER_05]: possible for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, if you as a manufacturer really
want to understand your manufacturing
[SPEAKER_05]: process, if you really want to ensure that
by the time you reach your final product
[SPEAKER_05]: stage, that you do have a quality product,
that you will pass your testing,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how you do that without doing
some in-process testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you might want to test your inputs
that you purchased from other vendors.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may want to test midstream in your
production process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly what is important to you is up to
your business process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, there was a risk analysis
discussion earlier this morning,
[SPEAKER_05]: like risk assessment is really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think unfortunately, a lot of
cannabis industry doesn't really
[SPEAKER_05]: understand that because all they really
know is the regs say I have to test my end
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's a lot of education to
be done and you as a lab can help explain
[SPEAKER_05]: that to them what your testing services
can offer to them in that regard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because even though when we look at more
standard GMP and other industry that often
[SPEAKER_05]: involves in-house testing, a lot of
facilities will have their own labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for one, labs are very expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of cannabis companies currently
don't have them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if they had the option to,
if they weren't required to use a third
[SPEAKER_05]: party lab, they may not want to invest in
that expense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, the labs are truly the experts
in the science.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why not utilize your services and your
expertise rather than trying to build that
[SPEAKER_05]: in-house?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope that helps with some of your
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think there's a lot of education
understanding that still needs to be done
[SPEAKER_05]: in that regard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we have a question on here,
this side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for the work you do and
everybody on the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to just ask this question to the
panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So speaking of plating-based methods,
we recently also had a large recall in
[SPEAKER_04]: Michigan what is the regulatory approach
for auditing products in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_04]: California to confirm previously recalled
products with safety concerns?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we approach this with plating
methods that have such lack of
[SPEAKER_04]: reproducibility internally and amongst
other labs as well?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like a question for Sherm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I monitor the recalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the various states, and so I've seen an
increase in the frequency of recalls for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products that are tested to be
beyond the action levels for total yeast
[SPEAKER_01]: and mold, for aspergillus, and there are
other contaminants that I focus on the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing you mentioned, plating
systems, and this is very problematic in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sense that, let's just take the
example of total yeast and mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that first of all, in the literature,
the cannabinoids have been shown to have
[SPEAKER_01]: antibiotic activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I say that word to myself,
I think bacterial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you also go into the literature,
there are certain antibiotics that besides
[SPEAKER_01]: affecting the growth of bacteria also
affect the growth of total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been shown in a paper that we
recently published where in the plating
[SPEAKER_01]: system of DRBC, which has chloramphenicol
and an additional antibiotic, actually
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased the growth of aspergillus by
five-fold.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this plating system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, there's endophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not measuring all the total yeast
and molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been shown also in the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we are a proponent of qPCR
testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm wondering if this might be an
opportunity where Jenny might talk about
[SPEAKER_07]: in California anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you handle when the, I'm sure this
never happens anywhere, but there's a
[SPEAKER_07]: discrepancy or there's a deficiency during
an investigation or something on the COA
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't quite line up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would never happen in reality,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's all hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you handle that in California?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't have a direct purview over
the lab side, but we did have a recent
[SPEAKER_02]: recall that we did execute at DCC.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a deficiency in lab results,
generally licensees are available and they
[SPEAKER_02]: are very helpful and we move very swiftly
to help us in a voluntary recall.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a COA doesn't pass, they also have the
option of remediation, which is sending it
[SPEAKER_02]: back to a manufacturer to either repackage
it or correct it for any kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could mean, again, repackaging or
drying if the LR activity was too high,
[SPEAKER_02]: remediating for mold, or for heavy metals
or pesticides or something if possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally the edibles are more difficult
to remediate unless it's packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those are kind of deficiencies on
the COA testing side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the deficiencies that come out of a
compliance inspection of a facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: we work closely with licensee to correct
them depending on the risk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe we have a question over
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is what is going on with any
kind of standards writing or application,
[SPEAKER_03]: either proposed or generic?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that ASTM had their D37 committee
and was looking into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on that committee for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found it very slow moving actually,
thorough but slow moving, but they're
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly a respected organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where they're at,
but it would seem to me that at least some
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of standards from which state
agencies or private sector could comply
[SPEAKER_03]: either voluntarily or with some
modifications are well needed in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry for everything from labeling,
packaging, dosing, what have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My second question is, and if you don't
mind, I'll take that liberty, and you may
[SPEAKER_03]: not be the right panel for it,
but I imagine you'll have something to say
[SPEAKER_03]: anyway, because most people do.
[SPEAKER_03]: What in the world is going on with the FDA
and CBD?
[SPEAKER_03]: For three and a half years since the farm
bill was passed, there remains tremendous
[SPEAKER_03]: confusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I like to call the Rubik's Cube
between laws and regulations and industry
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a lawyer, it's hard enough to advise
people what to do with this industry and
[SPEAKER_03]: to do it safely and correctly without
violating too many laws, but to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: explain, yes, hemp is a legal product,
but no, you can't sell CBD if it's an
[SPEAKER_03]: ingestible because the FDA hasn't gotten
around to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with those liberties, I look forward to
your comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's okay, I'll take the first question
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: With respect to standards, so as we know,
the regulations came out before the
[SPEAKER_07]: standards came out, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So standards organizations, AOAC,
ASCM, many of them have been running
[SPEAKER_07]: really fast to try to catch up to
regulations, and we're kind of like doing
[SPEAKER_07]: this right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And education has become a very strong
part of that whole process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I also was very involved with ASCM.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I was a founding member of D37,
but I'm no longer involved with ASCM.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are only so many volunteer
activities I can handle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I put my energy into AOAC, and it's a
very robust process.
[SPEAKER_07]: As Heather mentioned earlier, it's not a
popularity contest, it's not a we need a
[SPEAKER_07]: method, oh, I'll write one, great,
it's great, it sounds great, let's vote it
[SPEAKER_07]: in, now it's standard.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very, very, very rigorous process
that it goes through.
[SPEAKER_07]: So standard methods already exist.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have first action methods for
cannabinoids in plant material,
[SPEAKER_07]: in concentrates in oils, we have methods
for heavy metals, we have methods for
[SPEAKER_07]: beverages coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have those methods, many of them
are from private organizations,
[SPEAKER_07]: Eurofins, if you're familiar with
Eurofins, is responsible for the very
[SPEAKER_07]: first potency or cannabinoid method that's
out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they do exist, they are catching up,
but they're put through a lot of rigor
[SPEAKER_07]: before they become standard test methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to go through a vetted expert
review panel where you can't just sign up
[SPEAKER_07]: and say, yeah, I wanna vote on a method,
you actually have to have qualifications
[SPEAKER_07]: to be on that committee and review it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they are catching up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And our panelists here are part of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the other side of that saying,
oh, you feel like a limp noodle after
[SPEAKER_07]: you've submitted a method and it's gone
through that ERP and medicinal genomics
[SPEAKER_07]: has gone through it on behalf of the
product testing side of it as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a number, about a year or so ago,
a number of products were put through the
[SPEAKER_07]: ringers of hell for product
standardization for total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Medicinal genomics was one of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not an easy process to get
through.
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now, organizations like AOAC are
working very hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: As the advisor for that particular
program, we have scientists from around
[SPEAKER_07]: the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have working groups that number in the
hundreds and try managing a phone call
[SPEAKER_07]: with 100 people on the line from seven or
eight different countries, all coalescing
[SPEAKER_07]: on one scientific method.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not an easy process.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're all working together,
recognizing that the regulatory landscape
[SPEAKER_07]: is ever so changing and trying to keep up
with that and also trying to educate
[SPEAKER_07]: regulators on the empirical science side
of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of that is moving forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, as for the other question,
I'm not on that panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to answer that question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna leave that to our friends here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: As none of us are actually working at the
FDA, we obviously can't answer that
[SPEAKER_10]: question with any degree of confidence or
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we do know that the FDA is taking some
enforcement action.
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, did so just this week regarding
companies, not only that are selling CBD,
[SPEAKER_10]: but also for the first time, Delta-8,
and making claims that the FDA deemed
[SPEAKER_10]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they are taking some action.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think, as everyone in this room is
aware, have not yet issued any sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: nationwide regulations.
[SPEAKER_10]: We certainly, I think, look forward to the
day that that does occur.
[SPEAKER_10]: But unfortunately, it has not yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the FDA is in the best
position to do that in a way that it puts
[SPEAKER_10]: public health and public safety at the
forefront.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, this mic's really... I had a couple
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll drop this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one, do you guys on the panel see
any possible way to regulate the enormous
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of waste that's being produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, in California, it has to be
packaged products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge amounts of waste the lab produces
when they have to open up all these
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just paper or cardboard, but the
batteries themselves, we have to find ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to recycle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any thought on ever kind of
regulating that, or finding a way around
[SPEAKER_00]: it, the environmental concerns?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yesterday we had a panel around
it, and it's of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my first question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something that has been discussed,
including the tags that are used for track
[SPEAKER_02]: and trace.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've heard that there are companies
now that are looking to recycle them once
[SPEAKER_02]: the RFID chip is removed from the tags.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I would have to check in with
CalRecycle to better answer your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can connect after the panel,
I can try to find out the answer for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really hoping, you know, it's great to
see you all together, that there'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of future collaboration amongst
the states to sort of simplify and
[SPEAKER_00]: standardize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Susan answered my other
question, which was really around do you
[SPEAKER_00]: foresee adopting, you know, CAS or some
other compendium method and giving the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, especially laboratories,
opportunity to either adopt that or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least be prepared?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask this in light of, you know,
January 1st, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about, what, seven months left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will there be opportunity for that,
or will it be, you know, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: now adopt this in the next 30 days?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not uncommon for other industries to
defer to an AOAC or USP method.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, you can go to the FDA website for
some testing where the FDA will defer to
[SPEAKER_07]: an AOAC method, for example, or an ASTM
method, for example.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I personally foresee that happening in
the future if there comes a time when the
[SPEAKER_07]: FDA or other federal regulatory body steps
in that they may very likely defer
[SPEAKER_07]: laboratories to a specific compendium
method.
[SPEAKER_07]: But who's, you know, no mind readers here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_07]: But judging from other industries,
I wouldn't be surprised if that were the
[SPEAKER_07]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Current California law allows for an RPD
of 30% in potency analysis, plus or minus.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious if, with the adoption of
standardized methods, if that would be
[SPEAKER_08]: tightened, a laboratory can be off by 30%
and their analysis still be valid.
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's still the case with a
standardized method, nothing's going to
[SPEAKER_08]: change.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sorry, it's just a little,
the monitors are weird to hear,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you said California labs are allowed
to be off of their results?
[SPEAKER_08]: California regulations have an RPD of 30%.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus or minus 30%.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, there's a difference there
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, is the laboratory allowed to be
off by 30% or is the label number allowed
[SPEAKER_05]: to be within 30% of the laboratory's test
result?
[SPEAKER_08]: The results of the laboratory can vary
plus or minus 30%.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be within regulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the question is, is there going to be a
tightening of that criteria with the
[SPEAKER_08]: adoption of standardized methods?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would hope so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ahead, Susan.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the AOAC is non-partisan.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's non-governmental, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for the public.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not for anything private.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when the method performance
requirements are published and there's a
[SPEAKER_07]: solicitation for methods, we make every
effort to keep it as broad as possible,
[SPEAKER_07]: as long as it's scientifically sound.
[SPEAKER_07]: Up to this point, CASP has been focusing
on meeting regulatory requirements because
[SPEAKER_07]: the industry is desperate for those test
methods to meet regulatory requirements.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we all recognize that a lot of those
requirements are not necessarily founded
[SPEAKER_07]: empirically.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a very difficult balance in
developing those standard methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if we're not chasing a regulation and
we establish the performance requirements
[SPEAKER_07]: of a method, then life is good,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's up to the state to either require
a lab to meet our requirements,
[SPEAKER_07]: the standard requirements, or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we, AOAC methods do not dictate to the
state, but the state does have the ability
[SPEAKER_07]: to dictate back down to the standard
method.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that process belongs to the state.
[SPEAKER_08]: The question really pertains to the
development of standard methods and
[SPEAKER_08]: whether or not that would be a
consideration.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are so many things that I wish
for in this industry, in the testing
[SPEAKER_07]: industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my hope is that the regulatory bodies
that Kay and others have so profoundly
[SPEAKER_07]: mentioned today have not necessarily based
on the scientific foundation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now we have an institution like CASP
that's available and providing that
[SPEAKER_07]: education.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my hope is that in time those
regulations will become more in line with
[SPEAKER_07]: better or more sound science.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know I'm not answering your question
very directly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to be, I have my own opinion,
but I'm trying to be cognizant and
[SPEAKER_07]: respective of all the regulatory
environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: My turn.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not too loud.
[SPEAKER_09]: So going back to the cannabis control,
sorry, the regulatory limits for some of
[SPEAKER_09]: the category one pesticides from the
cannabis control group here in California,
[SPEAKER_09]: has there been discussion about perhaps
making those more scientifically valid?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because to say not detected is your lower
limit is, I don't know, the statistics
[SPEAKER_09]: aren't there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if there's any movement on
trying to make that more of a normal
[SPEAKER_09]: value.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not saying that right.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the way it is now to say that if you
detect anything at all, even though it's
[SPEAKER_09]: below your limit of detection,
you have to call that bad, it violates
[SPEAKER_09]: science.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll try to, I can try to, I'm not from
California, so I can't really say what the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulators are possibly going to do in
terms of defining that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think your concern is very valid.
[SPEAKER_05]: For one, a lab shouldn't be reporting a
detection below their limit of detection
[SPEAKER_05]: as a result, because again, it's below the
limit of detection.
[SPEAKER_05]: In theory, you can't see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you certainly can't see it with any
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But two,
[SPEAKER_05]: saying that the limit of detection is the
action limit is also, I think,
[SPEAKER_05]: is problematic because different
laboratories are going to have different
[SPEAKER_05]: detection limits based upon their
individual methodology.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may take the same sample to two
different labs and pass that one and fail
[SPEAKER_05]: at the other when it's based upon the
limit of detection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't actually mean either lab is
wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's also very challenging
then to understand as the customer
[SPEAKER_05]: submitting the sample for results.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also it will further drive our
problems with lab shopping where,
[SPEAKER_05]: again, labs may be tempted to make an
artificially high limit of detection so
[SPEAKER_05]: that they can pass more samples that
shouldn't actually be passing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we could probably spend another hour
or two talking about the challenges with
[SPEAKER_05]: pesticides and trying to come up with
action levels for cannabis given that the
[SPEAKER_05]: EPA has not established tolerance limits
for pesticides on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I completely understand why
California has defined those category one
[SPEAKER_05]: pesticides as a not detect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, as we just talked about,
there's a lot of challenges with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think regulators across the country
are grappling with how to require testing
[SPEAKER_05]: and establish action limits for pesticides
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having an ongoing working group in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And frankly, we've been talking about
pesticides for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at it right now again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just a really complicated debate
to try to figure out how to do this when
[SPEAKER_05]: we don't have the data that we would
normally have for something that would
[SPEAKER_05]: normally be a federally defined number.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are, I'm so sorry to say,
out of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can we are one minute over.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you are game, maybe we can field
one more question or we can say thank you
[SPEAKER_07]: very much to our panelists.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank you on behalf of all of us
here up on the stage for your
[SPEAKER_07]: participation and engagement.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have any questions, catch us when
we step down or when they step down and
[SPEAKER_07]: enjoy the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
