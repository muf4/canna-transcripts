[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I'm going to be talking about Delta
8.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the earlier talks did talk about
Delta 8, but more from a product
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, purity issues, quality
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today I'm just to talk just about the
actual molecule itself, both from a
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific perspective, but also from a
historical perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my disclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've worked with some companies on the
pharmacology of Delta 8 in the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: but really we have no ownership in any
company that produces or sells Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no real direct conflict of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to promote any particular
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interest in Delta 8 or awareness of
Delta 8 is something pretty new amongst
[SPEAKER_01]: the general population.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at just internet searches for
Delta 8 as a measure of awareness or
[SPEAKER_01]: interest, well, you see that before 2019
really nobody was searching for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably nobody or very few people even
knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: After around 2020, you see that interest
in searches just kind of exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this plot goes up to 2021,
but I'm sure that has just continued to go
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this plot is by state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the states where there's the most
interest are actually those states in
[SPEAKER_01]: which Delta 9 still remains illegal at the
state level, which isn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that awareness of Delta 8 is
fairly new has given some people the
[SPEAKER_01]: impression that Delta 8 as a molecule is
new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I read pretty regularly quotes like
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a quote from an article in
Forbes that was published just this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says, Delta 9 has been studied
extensively for nearly 60 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but little research is published on Delta
8.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't think this is true at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, research on Delta 8 is not a new
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been going on, as you can see from
the title of the talk, for over 80 years
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously not quite as much research as
Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't compare it to that, but quite a few
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we published a review article on this
last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we pretty much looked at every single
pharmacology study of Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's well over 150 publications,
not getting into the chemistry or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, but just getting into actual
studies of the pharmacology of Delta 8,
[SPEAKER_01]: over 150 publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give you a quick overview
of some of the findings today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, what is Delta 8?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people in this room probably
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's Delta 8 structure compared to Delta
9.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see overall they're very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're isomers, just one slight
difference of the location of this double
[SPEAKER_01]: bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this gives it just a slightly different
three-dimensional shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps Delta 8 can fit into the
cannabinoid receptors a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps it can fit in a little bit
differently with the enzymes that
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolize THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's also one additional layer of
complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you take edibles or when you take
THC orally, it's metabolized fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily before THC reaches the general
circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of these metabolites is actually
active.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the 11-hydroxy metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's formed both for Delta 8 and for Delta
9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we consider what are the
differences between these two molecules,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to consider not just the
differences in the parrot molecules,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also is there any difference in these
metabolites of 11-hydroxy Delta 8 compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to 11-hydroxy Delta 9?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to give you a historical frame of
reference, pretty famous here in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid research was 1964,
where Delta 9 THC was isolated and its
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical structure was identified by
Raphael Mishulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Delta 9 was recognized to be at that
point the primary active or psychoactive
[SPEAKER_01]: component in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to go back even 25 years
earlier than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 25 years before the isolation
identification of Delta 9 was actually the
[SPEAKER_01]: first synthesis of Delta 8 and actual
testing in animals and in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: This perhaps isn't quite as well known,
but this gentleman that you see here,
[SPEAKER_01]: his name is Roger Adams.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was an American chemist at the
University of Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 1939, the US government,
this is two years after the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government de facto made cannabis illegal
with the tax act in 1937.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in 1939, the US government had
actually asked this chemist to isolate the
[SPEAKER_01]: intoxicating compound of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we know he wasn't successful in that
because we know that Mishulam did it 25
[SPEAKER_01]: years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's one of the reasons that he
wasn't successful?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the US government actually gave him
samples of Minnesota fiber hemp to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with, which most people know has very,
very little Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he wasn't successful in actually
identifying this at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what does fiber hemp have a lot more
of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabidiol or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he actually published on the isolation
of CBD in 1940 in a partial structural
[SPEAKER_01]: identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does this have to do with Delta 8?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at this time, Roger Adams started
playing around with the molecule,
[SPEAKER_01]: making derivatives of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things he did was he put
CBD in an organic solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: He added a little bit of acid and he
heated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a reaction that I'm pretty sure
every chemist in this room is familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how even today we're converting CBD
into Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this reaction was first done over 80
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what he discovered at that time is
that when he did this reaction,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD could be converted to two different
molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was able to partially identify
these molecules and realize they were two
[SPEAKER_01]: chemically distinct molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was able to partially identify the ring
structure and had an idea that these were
[SPEAKER_01]: tetrahydrocannabinol molecules,
but couldn't actually tell exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he tested them both in animals and
realized that they were both psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he hypothesized that perhaps one or
some combination of both of these
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules were what was responsible for
the psychoactive effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we know today in retrospect that
these are Delta 8 and Delta 9 THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at the time he wasn't quite sure what
he was working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nonetheless, he decided, him and his
colleagues decided that it was time to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually test this in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first clinical testing of Delta 8
was actually done prior to 1942,
[SPEAKER_01]: or it was published in 1942.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was done at Welfare Island
Hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Welfare Island is now known as
Roosevelt Island in New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time it had a prison and the
penitentiary hospital on the islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they actually did a clinical study
using volunteer prisoners where they
[SPEAKER_01]: administered various different types of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was just a crude cannabis extract,
which of course has Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also administered the CBD drive Delta
8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was also two other
cannabinoids that he tested as well that I
[SPEAKER_01]: won't get into now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But given this was a study with 77
subjects, even to date, this is
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially the largest clinical study
that we have had of Delta 8 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time they didn't even know what
it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was published in 1942.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually a very interesting article that
basically Roger Adams subsequently to this
[SPEAKER_01]: study decided that he wanted to do some
additional studies, some additional
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent samples of Delta 8 to about a
dozen different chemistry colleagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they wrote letters to him saying,
hey, I tested it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took it with dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I felt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those descriptions are very
pretty entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can definitely provide the reference
for people to read this article that's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the effects of Delta 8 that were
actually observed in this study in the
[SPEAKER_01]: prison were pretty familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you saw elevated pulse rate,
dry mouth, sometimes anxiety, sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: euphoria, increased hunger, drowsiness,
laughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those prisoners who had been high
before or used cannabis before,
[SPEAKER_01]: they said this feels a lot like using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was the first indication in humans
back in 1942 that, hmm, it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 8 is acting an awful lot like Delta
9 or like cannabis, even before they even
[SPEAKER_01]: knew what Delta 8 actually was.
[SPEAKER_01]: After this, it was a pretty slow period
for cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_01]: After 1942, US entered World War II.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research priorities of the US
government just changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roger Adams essentially went on to retire
from cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked on other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just a slow 25 years or so for
cannabinoid research until 1964,
[SPEAKER_01]: when Mushulam identified Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shortly after, the structure of Delta
8 THC was identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they really had the tools to
assess Delta 8 versus Delta 9 THC
[SPEAKER_01]: quantitatively and see, is there any
quantitative difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they started giving Delta 8,
Delta 9 to animals, to different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they could clearly see, well,
it's overall doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Qualitatively, we see the same effects as
cannabis, Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they started looking at
individual species, they started to see
[SPEAKER_01]: some differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the very early animal studies in
the 1960s, early 1970s tended to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: monkeys, on dogs, on rats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they saw was a pretty consistent
trend that Delta 8 was always a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: weaker than Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the first time they had really
observed this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in monkeys, you needed about a fourfold
higher dose of intravenous Delta 8 to have
[SPEAKER_01]: an equivalent effect to Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: In dog and rat assays, you needed about a
two-fold higher dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was starting to look like there was
a consistent pattern here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, researchers started using
monkeys and these dog assays less and less
[SPEAKER_01]: and started using mice more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they developed these, it's called
Tetrad assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a set of four assays they typically
do in mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if these assays have positive results
in all four, that usually indicates it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid agonist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they tested Delta 8, in these
Tetrad assays in mice, they actually saw
[SPEAKER_01]: something a little bit different from the
other species.
[SPEAKER_01]: They saw that Delta 8 had the same potency
as Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a little bit weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't really know exactly,
or I imagine they didn't really know what
[SPEAKER_01]: to make of this at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep in mind that at that time,
they had never tested Delta 8 in humans,
[SPEAKER_01]: except for that one very early study where
they didn't really know what they were
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't know, would humans look
more like mice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would Delta 8 be the same, the same
potency?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would they look more like monkeys and have
very different potency?
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, they just didn't have any
data to say, or at least no published
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't have to wait too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1973, they actually published,
there was two studies published almost
[SPEAKER_01]: simultaneously, one from a group in the
US, one from a group in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And between these two different
publications, they actually tested
[SPEAKER_01]: intravenous dosing, oral dosing,
like edibles, and smoked as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of these studies compared both Delta
8 and Delta 9 THC at a range of doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just kind of re-plotted the data
from all these studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see on the y-axis, essentially just a
scale of subjectively how high people felt
[SPEAKER_01]: or how strongly they felt the effects
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the x-axis, you see different doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So overall, what you see across these
different routes of administration is very
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently across all different doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: At any one given dose, the effects of
Delta 9 are almost always stronger than
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while of course we kind of all know
that's true today, at the time in 1973,
[SPEAKER_01]: this was like totally new data because
people really didn't have, didn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: have any idea at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they knew it was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew Delta 9 was more potent than
Delta 8 THC, but otherwise they knew it
[SPEAKER_01]: was doing about the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how could they explain this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is there this difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they didn't really have any ability
to test this because in 1973, they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even know how THC worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one hypothesis that there was a
receptor for THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is another hypothesis that there was
no receptor, that THC molecules were just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of perturbing the neuronal membranes
in a very nonspecific manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had to wait another 15 years
before they even identified that the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual mechanism and the specific receptor
for THC to actually start looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanisms of why Delta 8 and why Delta 9
are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was 1988.
[SPEAKER_01]: They first identified in the rat brain the
cannabinoid CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then shortly thereafter, they cloned
the receptor, meaning they identified the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could put that DNA sequence into
cells and cause the cells to produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor in order to study it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now 15 years after the first clinical
data, they finally have this ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually see, okay, at the cannabinoid
receptor, is there any difference at the
[SPEAKER_01]: level of the receptor of what Delta 8 is
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that every species has a
slightly different version of the CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The human CB1 receptor isn't equal to the
mouse CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a different DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It functions slightly differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they actually did these Delta 8 versus
Delta 9 tests using cannabinoid receptors
[SPEAKER_01]: from all different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, rats.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, they did the rat receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as I had said earlier, in vivo and
whole rats, they saw about a two-fold
[SPEAKER_01]: potency difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, looking in vitro effects
of Delta 8 and Delta 9 at the rat CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor, it looked like Delta 8 had about
two to three-fold less affinity for the
[SPEAKER_01]: CB1 receptor, about a two to three-fold
difference in the potency and its ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to activate the receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this seemed to make some sense that
this is going to explain this difference
[SPEAKER_01]: in affinity for the receptor is going to
explain why Delta 8 has a different effect
[SPEAKER_01]: in vivo and rats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they repeated this in mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, mice seem to be a little bit
of an outlier that in vivo and mice,
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 8 had about the same potency as
Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, on average, there's probably over
a dozen different studies where they
[SPEAKER_01]: tested it in mice and there's a range of
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on average, it was about the same
potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, sure enough, when they looked in
vitro at the mouse version of the CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor, they saw that Delta 8 had about
the same affinity, the same potency as
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seemed like this difference at the
receptor was really what was driving the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in whole animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that seemed to make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the next piece of data came out a
little bit, I would say, unexpected,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was the human version of the
cannabinoid CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know in humans, everybody has their
own idea of what the difference in potency
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's say on average, give or take
about two-folds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, when they looked at the human CB1
receptor, they actually saw a six-fold
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Delta 8 had six-fold less affinity than
Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's kind of weird because we
don't see a six-fold decrease in potency
[SPEAKER_01]: in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is something that's not
100% understood exactly why there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: contradiction between what we see at the
human receptor and what we see in vivo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could argue, well, it's different
experimental conditions because different
[SPEAKER_01]: labs have these different conditions in
which they run these assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps it's just not a very accurate
result.
[SPEAKER_01]: But three different independent
laboratories have published the six-fold
[SPEAKER_01]: difference, give or take, between Delta 8
and Delta 9 at the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there could be some other mechanism
going on here that we just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finally, too, to finish up,
I want to talk more globally about
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially other differences in the
effects of Delta 8 versus Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one possibility, maybe kind of an
uninteresting possibility, Delta 8 does
[SPEAKER_01]: the exact same thing as Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a little bit weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, there's a lot of overlap.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it doing the exact same thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another more interesting possibility is
that it actually has distinct
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacological effects that actually
differentiate it from Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one example of this, at this point,
I would say it's just a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't been tested in clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people report that Delta 8
produces less anxiety than Delta 9 at a
[SPEAKER_01]: dose that otherwise gives equivalent
overall effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there could be other differences in
subjective effects or therapeutic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just not enough research.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is currently one or two ongoing
clinical studies, which is good to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, we have very little data to
actually see if there is perhaps a case
[SPEAKER_01]: where Delta 8 could have a different
therapeutic effect than Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully, we'll see some more
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is this even something that's likely?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there a mechanism that could explain
why Delta 8 might be different than Delta
[SPEAKER_01]: 9?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think there is mechanistically a
possibility for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: An example of this potential mechanism of
how Delta 8 could be different is at the
[SPEAKER_01]: CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I already told you Delta 8 is weaker at
the CB1 receptor than Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Delta 8 has the same potency as Delta
9 at the CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just imagine a hypothetical
scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really just me all hypothesizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the CB2 receptor, it's expressed
very heavily in immune cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It potentially has an anti-inflammatory
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: A very different effect from the CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's imagine this hypothetical
scenario, which is just based on in vitro
[SPEAKER_01]: binding data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the left, you have Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: And according to this data of this
particular publication, 18 nanomolars of
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 9, that concentration will produce
about 50% binding of the CB1 receptor,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means out of all the CB1 receptor,
half of it is bound to Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, CB2 receptor binding affinity is
about the same as CB1 for Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's maybe, according to this publication,
a little bit weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where you have 50% occupancy at Delta
1, you have about 30% occupancy at CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now let's consider the situation of
Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's one thing we know?
[SPEAKER_01]: People will hydrate the dose to the effect
they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they want to feel a particular
effect of Delta 8, they're just gonna take
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more of it compared to Delta
9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's assume the person takes a
slightly higher dose of Delta 8 to
[SPEAKER_01]: compensate for this slightly weaker
effects, and still they end up with 50%
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor occupation at the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because now they're into a higher
dose range, and because the CB2 affinity
[SPEAKER_01]: is the same as Delta 9, they would
actually end up with something more like
[SPEAKER_01]: 85% occupancy of the CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're kind of lost with what does
all this receptor occupancy data mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me just put it in the more simple
context.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, clinical terms, at doses which give
equivalent psychoactive effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 8 could have, at least
theoretically, a greater anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_01]: effect compared to Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just kind of my hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has not been, you know, clinically
proven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's directly studied this yet,
but I just want to provide this as one
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of hypothetical example of how Delta
8 may have different therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: properties compared to Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, there's gonna be a lot of
overlap between the two, but perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: there's cases where one could be more
appropriate for one patient and another
[SPEAKER_01]: more appropriate for a different patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll end there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did publish this paper on Delta 8 in
British Journal of Pharmacology last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: so if you want to learn more about Delta
8, you can read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's open access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I'm happy to take any questions
now, if there's time, or later.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always just send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to reviewing your paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question, any idea of the differences
between Delta 8 and Delta 9 at other
[SPEAKER_00]: clinically relevant targets, like the
PPARS or the TRIP channels?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, to the best of my knowledge,
and you know, this was a year ago when you
[SPEAKER_01]: reviewed the literature pretty
comprehensively, so unless it's something
[SPEAKER_01]: very new, they haven't assayed at any
other targets besides CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'm getting kicked off stage,
so thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
