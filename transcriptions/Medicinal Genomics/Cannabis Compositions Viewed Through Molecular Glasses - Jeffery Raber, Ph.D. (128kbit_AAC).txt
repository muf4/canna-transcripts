[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming back after lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, Don.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry it wasn't a Mega Millions ticket,
but good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a chemist by trade, PhD in organic
chemistry, background in biochemistry as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, and I thought I'd talk a little bit
from a molecular perspective what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2010, we started as an analytical
testing lab providing independent testing
[SPEAKER_00]: services in California, and through that
we certainly learned a whole deal a great
[SPEAKER_00]: deal about what was in each of the
cannabis products, what's not supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we're starting to see
legislated and regulated testing that is
[SPEAKER_00]: mandatory in the state of California,
which is a great, wonderful thing because
[SPEAKER_00]: there certainly are a number of
contaminants that we need to concern
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves with, especially when providing
patient medicines as these are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think most of us in the crowd are
relatively well aware that there are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of molecules in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly one of the things that
excited me as a chemist and as a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: purveyor to say there are a lot of tools
that could be provided to doctors,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the medical community, and lots of
options that could be provided to
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last count that I had heard was it's
around, you know, 1,270 different
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals are known to be present in and
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant itself makes some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others are degradants through natural
degradation processes and other metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are around 144 different
cannabinoids, the cannabinoid acids being
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that the plant produces itself
and the neutral cannabinoids being the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that are degraded from heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpenes and turpenoids were something
when we first started in 2010 that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people had never really heard of in the
general lexicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what we did in 2011 was begin
offering testing for turpenes and turpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiling and gave that test away for a
few months so that people would see the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately today we can see that almost
everyone wants to talk about turpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very turpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of turp sauce out there,
which is entertaining to me as a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good sign that everyone's
talking about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of the magic that comes from
cannabis and what makes it much more
[SPEAKER_00]: useful as a medicine than other types of
therapeutic approaches are that it has
[SPEAKER_00]: this host of molecules to offer all at
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only a single molecule type
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not one lock and one key.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's many, many molecules being offered to
the body and allowing the body to
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligently select which ones may be
most useful to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, most of them are very,
very safe to the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see in most of the cannabis
products are typical ratios that you hear
[SPEAKER_00]: of the major cannabinoids, THCA,
THC, CBD, predominantly reported as THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBD ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant again makes THC acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see most types of ratios,
one to one, two to one, three to one,
[SPEAKER_00]: three to two, and greater than 15 or 20 to
one of a predominant cannabinoid and many
[SPEAKER_00]: minor cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant ratios are much more restricted
than what you can get from products that
[SPEAKER_00]: are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extracted products, processed products,
you can blend those ratios virtually to
[SPEAKER_00]: anything you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to see a lot more of
that approach as we got license holders
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to manufacture in consistent
basis and they can produce these
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also seeing, as I said, more
reporting about terpenes and terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prominent ones are limonene,
mercine, karyophylline, the pineenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are, I believe, driving a lot of
the therapeutic and medicinal effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids and making the cannabis
composition, what we like to refer to it
[SPEAKER_00]: as, much more effective than just one
cannabinoid or one terpene by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the word ensemble effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know entourage effect has been
popularized, but ensemble makes us think
[SPEAKER_00]: of all of them at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just one molecule and a bunch of
other little players, but they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: important, making that all important
cannabis composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of data that says
there's some utility for single molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those medicines in Marinol and
Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a great presentation from Alice
earlier today on Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And putting more than one together is SAT
of X, and that seems to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's therapeutically effective as well for
some.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you can add many, many more of
them, you start to see a broader base
[SPEAKER_00]: utility, broader base efficaciousness,
and much greater response from a broad
[SPEAKER_00]: patient population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been some good work out of
Israel from Ruth Galilee that demonstrated
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD by itself was not as therapeutically
effective as a whole plant spectrum or a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis concentrate containing CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of the times, these
concentrates or other products are not
[SPEAKER_00]: well classified or characterized,
and it can be difficult from a research
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective to really know all of the
molecules that are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe we'll hear more from Dee Dee
Mary about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been doing a great deal of work in
that respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the molecules are what makes this
really important, leading to a great
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistic factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one plus one does not equal two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It equals more than that for some reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the further complexity with
cannabis products in that it's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: one product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the regulator would love to think it's
just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think everybody that knows these
products knows that there are a large
[SPEAKER_00]: plethora of product types, from plant
material to concentrated forms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then all the derivative products that
can come from concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add to that that you can take them in a
variety of different ways, from inhalation
[SPEAKER_00]: to oral consumption, topicals,
and even sublinguals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a large kind of panacea of
opportunity, but with that complexity
[SPEAKER_00]: comes the challenge of finding what's
right for which patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We demonstrated in 2015 and published this
in the Natural Products Chemistry and
[SPEAKER_00]: Research Journal that chemotyping is going
to be exceptionally important to
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding which medicines and product
types we're giving to which patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: when.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we don't understand the compositions
and what we're giving to the patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're never going to have a good medical
dialogue or one that explains which
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules or sets of molecules are most
important for which therapeutic effects
[SPEAKER_00]: when delivered in which specific fashions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of others have done similar types of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're starting to see at least
the scientific community talk more about
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotyping, which chemovirus do we have,
and how understanding just a cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: name, such as OG Cush, train wreck,
or something of that type, doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily represent which types of
molecules are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, indica, sativa, hybrid doesn't
represent which molecules are present
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do this in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're making great progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, two weeks ago,
I see this headline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still more evidence that all of it's the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was rather frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Vice Media, for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fortunately, there was a bunch of
community comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went back and corrected the article a
little bit and tried to clarify that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, didn't mean to say it was all the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: This had happened actually before 2015 as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this article didn't comment much at
all about terpenes, which we know are
[SPEAKER_00]: great differentiators to the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our data clearly showed that terpenes were
major differentiators in looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars and looking at the different
compositions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it's very important that we
look at more than just the cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to look at many to classify these
in the proper fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What our data demonstrated was the indica
sativa designation is great for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology, but not for which chemicals
are present, nor which physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: effects you could expect from those types
of molecules being present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really need to move towards this
chemotyping classification system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to take the broader
community and all of us working together
[SPEAKER_00]: to really assess the best way of doing
that so that we all don't lose our minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a large number of possibilities
and a lot of different ways that you might
[SPEAKER_00]: look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to have to keep it simple
enough to communicate on a very easy
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion and really explain to patients and
laypeople who are not science-driven what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're taking and how to find the right
medicines for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is certainly going to be a big
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not quite so bad when you look at
just the plant and which molecules are
[SPEAKER_00]: present on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens often and what we're now
seeing, we were just talking earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are about 30% of the products
present in Colorado are in flower or plant
[SPEAKER_00]: matter form.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other products are concentrates,
extracts, or derivatives from those
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really matters what's happening to
all the molecules in that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: composition as I start to process it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that product produced and made?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the fate of terpenes or other
types of volatile molecules as I go
[SPEAKER_00]: through this manufacturing process?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, there are a large number of
ways that we might extract or process the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the predominant ones are listed
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water-based methods, rosin pressing is
another example, hydrocarbon extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol extraction, or CO2-based methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I quite often hear the whole plant
extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if I needed the whole plant,
why bother putting it in the extractor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just take the whole plant,
press it in a pill like I had,
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep the whole plant in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we hear, though, are full spectrum,
whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all the molecules after I
extracted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one here should believe that they've
just left cellulose behind in the
[SPEAKER_00]: extractor and kept everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really lose a large number of molecules
through the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really change in composition as I
go through that processing methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm winterizing, it's the process of
adding ethanol, cooling the mixture down
[SPEAKER_00]: so fats and waxes precipitate,
filtering them off, and then evaporating
[SPEAKER_00]: the ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I evaporate the ethanol,
I'm also evaporating most of the terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're of a similar boiling point
and are light volatile molecules as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always ask the question, did you
winterize?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you have all of the terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get the crazy look of what am I
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is most of them are not
testing for terpenes or broader base
[SPEAKER_00]: composition profiles after they do their
manufacturing methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still left with a lot of strain
names or cultivar names in concentrated
[SPEAKER_00]: products saying I used jack hair in my
extractor, so I have a jack hair
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't even know how to clearly
define or classify a jack hair concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: unless we are to say this many molecules
makes up that composition when they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: in these ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can go ahead and define them in
that fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a testing perspective,
we do not see a broader based and really
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate perspectives given to the
concentrates in a sense of which other
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes or secondary molecules might be
present in addition to the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, California regulations and
laws are going to force the California
[SPEAKER_00]: market to test and report their terpene
compositions if they're going to market
[SPEAKER_00]: them and put them on their products and on
their label.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way that you can go about
standardizing concentrates is the fashion
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're taking, analyzing plant
material, understanding which components
[SPEAKER_00]: are present, and then rebuilding that
composition through individual ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: to create a complex formulation that can
be standardized, consistent, reproducible,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then add that to concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as concentrates reach higher purity,
single molecule isolates are now available
[SPEAKER_00]: such as CBD or THC acid in high purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can create highly complex cannabis
compositions that are standardized and
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducible even at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what we have seen,
we've been doing this type of work since
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014, filed provisional patents in 2013 on
these methodologies, really demonstrates
[SPEAKER_00]: to us that the cannabinoids can all be the
same, but I can put 10 different terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures together and see 10 different
physiological responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think terpenes are significant
drivers to the overall ensemble or
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really believe that holds a lot of
the magic of cannabis and why we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: here talking about cannabis compositions
instead of single molecule isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think the next step in that is really
labeling and properly informing the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers and patients, as well as the
medical community and the regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've come up with some names,
native, inspired, and emboldened to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and define which chemicals are being
present in those standardized formulations
[SPEAKER_00]: and how close to the plant or other types
of agents that you might add for flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancement or even physiological effect
enhancements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be the next generation,
I think, of what we tackle with regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: to help inform everybody in a proper
fashion because a good label is really
[SPEAKER_00]: what helps drive consumer protection and
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standardizing those products, especially
in concentrate forms, then allows you to
[SPEAKER_00]: standardize all of your delivery
platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I described there inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that a lot in vape carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very prevalent for us in
tinctures, tablets, topicals, and other
[SPEAKER_00]: derivative products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have a concentrate that is very
standardized, then you can start to use
[SPEAKER_00]: that in a medical delivery fashion such as
a tablet or a tincture and really have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good dialogue with patients who will be
confident that their responses will be
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we can start to get solid
titratable regimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can understand the composition because
it's well characterized, up to almost 70
[SPEAKER_00]: different molecules that you know are
present, which ones at which ratios in
[SPEAKER_00]: high amounts or low amounts, and what's
starting to drive these preferred medical
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting and I think we still have
yet to see how individualized might
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have one composition for one
patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have cases like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which compositions might drive 50% or
large majorities of the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And which ones do we want to then move
into the clinic so that we can issue that
[SPEAKER_00]: as standardized medical platforms as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tinctures, edibles, tablets, topicals
don't suffer the same fate as inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to worry about heating or
other types of things in an airstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what I'm giving to the
patient via those deliveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Deb Kimliss talked about a tablet
composition yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see more of those
offered in medical states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen anti-plant perspectives on the
East Coast from some regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe you can standardize plant
compositions and use those for
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporization and inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inhalation offers different metabolic
profiles than oral consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really should be open-minded and
broad-based in our approach to saying
[SPEAKER_00]: what's right for which patients and what's
best for each individual patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will be a little easier perhaps to
standardize some other derivative forms
[SPEAKER_00]: than the plant material itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what is repeatable is very
important, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we talk about delivering the same
product to the same patient populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we know that they're also using it
the same at home?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's on the labels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which product types are they getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doctors, are they getting a
standardized medical product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they getting it via a prescription?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they just getting something in the
adult use markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those label-specific medications
and how tightly controlled might those
[SPEAKER_00]: compositions be?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this medicine is very effective
for many.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's relatively safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a broad-based safety profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else goes along with it comes from
better testing to make sure its purity is
[SPEAKER_00]: proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we can really deliver a lot of
interesting medicines from just the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal, and I think everyone's goal,
should be what is the minimum effective
[SPEAKER_00]: dose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the med back in medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to overdo it here at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's exceptionally complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the potential energy surface here
thinking about where exactly might each
[SPEAKER_00]: patient lie?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I find the right little square for
each individual patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do I get them to find that as
quickly as possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I not get stuck on the top of the
hill or in someplace that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I find the most effective means of
getting them there as quickly as possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we define compositions in a
broad-based fashion, we can pick either
[SPEAKER_00]: ends of the spectrum and kind of start
funneling them down to their desired
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be a relatively short period of
trial and error that they actually get
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the honest conversation is there's
going to be an iterative process with you
[SPEAKER_00]: patient to finding the right medicine and
form for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that this indica is going to
deliver this and this sativa is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pick one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have to move away from that
conversation and really advance our
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies and language so that we can
explain which is going to be right for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what's coming in the near
future is the rise of the next
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids novel cannabinoids and things
such as the one that I've highlighted
[SPEAKER_00]: here, Delta 8 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have manufacturing methodologies to
create high-purity Delta 8 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see other versions of Delta 8 THC
on the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing them with significant
impurity profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an overlay of the chromatograms
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see large unknowns in addition to some
Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what's the purity?
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I introducing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how might I utilize that in a medical
fashion?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to start to see more
and more cannabinoids as more
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies are developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal is to license these
technologies to medical purveyors,
[SPEAKER_00]: brand builders, and groups that would like
to take them into the clinic so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can standardize this medicine in the most
effective way for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
