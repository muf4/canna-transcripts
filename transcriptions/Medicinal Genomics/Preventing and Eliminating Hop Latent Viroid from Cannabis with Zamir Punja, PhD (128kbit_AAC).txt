[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, I had the pleasure of
speaking with Dr. Zamir Poonja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zamir is a professor of plant
biotechnology at Simon Fraser University.
[SPEAKER_00]: His research interests include the
etiology and management of plant diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: on vegetable and horticultural crops and
the applications of biotechnology for
[SPEAKER_00]: disease management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2018, his work has shifted to
researching on cannabis, where his group
[SPEAKER_00]: has described a range of previously
unreported pathogens affecting the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: and has evaluated various methods of
disease management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zamir's latest research has been focused
on a pathogen that is spreading throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivation facilities worldwide,
hoplatinviroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: HLVD, as it's also called, is a relatively
new pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was first identified in hops in the
late 80s and was just detected in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also quite small, only 40 nanometers
in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, in just five years, this tiny
pathogen has managed to infect as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of cannabis facilities in California
alone, all while reducing yields as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as 50% and costing the industry $4 billion
in losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zamir shared his latest research on HLVD
at CanMed 23, which is the basis of our
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put a link to his video presentation
in the show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our conversation covers why Zamir
considers HLVD to be the COVID of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, how HLVD spreads, the effect
HLVD has on cannabis plants, including
[SPEAKER_00]: some really amazing electron microscope
images that he captured of affected
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, practical recommendations for
testing plants for HLVD, and possible
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions to the HLVD problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Zamir, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Feno Express.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feno Express offers low-cost genetic
testing services to cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using QPCR technology, Feno Express helps
cultivators identify genetic traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as plant sex, while plants are still
in the seedling tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also identify plant pathogens,
such as hoplatinviroid, lettuce chlorosis
[SPEAKER_00]: virus, and powdery mildew, before the
plants show obvious signs of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact Feno Express today so they can
help you predict, prevent, and eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: major crop problems before they happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at FenoExpress.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's P-H-E-N-O-X-P-R-E-S-S dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zamir Poonja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Zamir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us on the
podcast again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to talk with you today about a
topic that everyone seems to be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, and that's hoplatinviroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching or listening and you're
not familiar with HLVD, well, you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: the right place because Zamir has done
extensive research into the viroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: much of which he shared at CanMed23 in his
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put the link to that video in the
show description so you can check that
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, not only are we going to cover
what HLVD is, but also talk about ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially prevent and or eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Zamir, at CanMed23, you called
hoplatinviroid the COVID of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which does have a nice ring to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a good way to describe
what is going on in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: for those who might not be familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please explain why you believe HLVD to
be the COVID of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I thought I'd throw that in because
there's a lot of similarities between what
[SPEAKER_01]: we've experienced with COVID over the last
three years and what's happening with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, these are both organisms
that one's a virus, which is the COVID,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other one's a viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they behave very similarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the literature shows that viruses and
viroids behave in a very similar manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one obvious thing that drew my
attention to the fact that there are many
[SPEAKER_01]: similarities, the other being it spreads
really easily by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know with COVID, wash your hands,
make sure you don't touch surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you blow your nose, make sure you
throw away the tissues and so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any material that comes into contact
with your hands that has hoplatin infected
[SPEAKER_01]: material like sap is going to transmit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was another analogy that I thought
was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it spreads really well,
both COVID and the hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I should make a distinction here that
hoplatin does not spread in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some reports where people say,
oh, yeah, it's airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to watch your vents.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't spread in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it'll spread through seed,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's pollen, the pollen will
fertilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a general operation where you're
growing plants, mothers, flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to worry about the airborne
aspect of hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, unlike COVID, of course, where we
develop vaccines, we don't have vaccines
[SPEAKER_01]: for hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to develop some other methods to
address it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the other main differences,
which I think is important in COVID,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you remember, we were getting a lot of
mutations, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: New strains were coming up all the time
and they had to develop new vaccines for
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now with hoplatin, we haven't seen a
lot of genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, it looks like the first
report in California, that genetic strain
[SPEAKER_01]: that was there is very similar to one in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's similar to the one in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually found it in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it almost looks like right now anyway,
it's genetically fairly stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not diverged itself as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that's due to, maybe with more
selection pressure in the human
[SPEAKER_01]: population, there's so much diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: People react differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the virus is constantly trying to
keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in the cannabis world, it's perhaps
not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing with COVID and hoplatin,
the symptoms, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've had people that are asymptomeless
with COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: The test positive, but no fever,
no runny nose, no sneezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in cannabis, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have these asymptomatic plants that,
unless you do a PCR test, which we'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: into later, you may or may not know that
you've got hoplatin because the plants may
[SPEAKER_01]: not show any symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a ton of similarities between
the two types of diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wish we had the kind of money that
was thrown at us in cannabis because I
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you, if we did that, we'd be done in
a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have all the problem solved because
you need money for research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's getting pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a few things that you
mentioned in there that I jotted down that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be kind of news to me because I know
that there has been some discussion and
[SPEAKER_00]: debate about whether HLVD actually spreads
through seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seemed like you were just saying
that, yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's some pretty good evidence
that tummy genomic released and shared
[SPEAKER_01]: with us, as well as work that they did
with Texas A&M.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took infected mothers and added
pollen that was cleaned from a clean
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found that a high proportion of
seeds that came out of that had hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about on the outside versus
the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they took a healthy mother and
then they took pollen from an infected
[SPEAKER_01]: male and put that onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, they got seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got the seeds that had hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The infected females that receive healthy
male pollen had a higher seed infection
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mothers being infected is more
important than the father being infected
[SPEAKER_01]: or the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the contamination or hoplatin
was on the outside on the seed coat,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very common with many viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did show maybe 10%, 15% infection
inside the mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did experiments where they
totally cleaned the outside of the seed to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point where the seed was pretty much
killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they rescued the tissues from
inside and ran a PCR on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's both outside and inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And infected mothers play a more important
role than infected pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if you did have a seed that had the
viroid on the outside and maybe not in the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside, but you didn't clean it,
disinfect it, or whatever, and were to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that seed, could it infect the plant
that emerges?
[SPEAKER_01]: It could in cases where the seed coat was
still attached to the cartilidin coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the plant that's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some abrasion against the
cartilidin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get transmission there through
mechanical damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, the only way to know for sure,
obviously, would be to test that seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got five seeds, really high
priced seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've grown them up and you've got
these five seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd test every one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to be sure, because that's a
great point where hoplite can start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to eliminate that option.
[SPEAKER_01]: So testing seedlings, we'll talk about
what the right stage of testing would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say the best way is really
just to test to make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to kind of complete, I guess,
setting the stage for people who might not
[SPEAKER_00]: be familiar with hoplite and viroid,
we talked about how it's spreading and its
[SPEAKER_00]: similarities to COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is it actually doing to the
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this such an issue with
cultivators?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the first discovery of hoplite was
made, it was made in hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was back in about 88.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the researchers figured out what
the sequence of the viroid was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't see any symptoms on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they tried to transmit it to
other plants, they didn't see anything
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they gave it the name hoplite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the word latent basically means no
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, with COVID, you could be
infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: But be latent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're harboring the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the PCR tests are showing it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're not expressing symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the latent comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then later, at some point,
and usually it's when the plants go into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, that we see the most dramatic
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I first recognized it when I
looked at a flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was much shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowers weren't developed as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of the dudding symptom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowers were smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the same symptoms that the
California researchers in two different
[SPEAKER_01]: labs reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they first saw hoplite and
viroid was on these flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you measure THC and CBD and
terpenes and so on, what you find out is
[SPEAKER_01]: that they've dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've dropped, depending on the genetics
of the plant and when the plant got
[SPEAKER_01]: infected, anywhere from 10% to 40% lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when the alarm bells start
going off, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got this infection that came
literally out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they hadn't seen it before,
but it showed up on the flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you work backwards, you can see
symptoms in mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get mother plants that are
somewhat stunted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see symptoms in the veg,
particularly depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptibility of the genotype you're
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen stunted plants in veg that are
obviously hoplite and infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves are slightly curled.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't rely on symptomology alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely do the testing to make
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the alarm bells go off when you're
walking through a flowering room and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at the plants and you
recognize that genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet you're looking at it and saying,
these flowers haven't developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like they're like two weeks
behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you may understand that you've
got hoplite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you mentioned hops and obviously
it's in the name there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense that it started there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But did I hear that right where hoplite
and viroid never really had a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on hops, like any variety?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they first started, they didn't
see any effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as research shows, the more you
look into it, the more you find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other labs started looking at it,
particularly in Europe, in Germany and
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started to see, in the UK,
they started to see the cones,
[SPEAKER_01]: the flowers, the end result of the flowers
in hops are called cones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cones had lower acids and phenolics
and other chemicals that essential oils
[SPEAKER_01]: and terpenes that are used to help enhance
the flavor of beer and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were starting to see lower,
lower quantities of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant itself was not affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever seen a hop plant,
that thing, it grows in front of your
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's putting on 12, 14 inches of
growth a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's unlikely hoplite does much on
that, but it did seem to affect the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, when I read that report,
I thought, OK, this is happening in hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to happen in cannabis because
they both have similar flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: structures and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now they're finding, but it's very
genotype dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the cultivar, some of them
seem to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They resist the virus or the viroid,
and others really come down hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I draw the analogy to COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people get it and they're walking
away fine, and others have to be sent to
[SPEAKER_01]: the ER.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a part of it is what your genetic
constitutional background is that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so has that been the way that the hop
industry has sort of dealt with the issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've sort of just moved towards using
cultivars that are more tolerant of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're aware that it's spread by
mechanical transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in hops where they use machines to
maybe prune the plants or they take
[SPEAKER_01]: cuttings, they're very careful to know
that it's spread that way through the sap,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is useful information because the
exact same thing happens in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you take cuttings and you make
vegetative plants out of the original
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, or you're using shears or tools
that weren't necessarily clean properly,
[SPEAKER_01]: that will spread hop latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they found in hops as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't see very high transmission in
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was there, maybe five to 8%,
not as high as what we're seeing in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it may be that the female plant,
the mother plant, wasn't as heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was a little bit of
infection, but it wasn't enough to create
[SPEAKER_01]: a very high seed transmission rate as we
see in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned, too, that when you were
explaining some of the differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: HLVD and COVID, that the number of
different variants didn't seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: apparent in HLVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when the viroid jumped from hops to
cannabis, was there a change there or is
[SPEAKER_00]: it effectively the same viroid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sequences that we have, and the ones
that Kevin McKernan has looked at in
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal genomics, they're identical to
the 1988 report on hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there doesn't seem to have been a
significant amount of change, at least in
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetic structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of the papers I read on other
viroids, there's about 32 other viroids in
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants, like potato, spindle,
tuber viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see a lot of genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it is when the viroid is
moving from host to host.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potato, spindle, tuber viroid has the
big host strains, tobacco, tomato,
[SPEAKER_01]: petunia, lots of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were able to show, as it moves
into these other hosts, I guess it needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to adapt itself to this new environment
and creates a new strain or a new variant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be what's happening in
humans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When it jumps from China to India to
America, it's mutating as it goes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have different genetic backgrounds,
genetic composition, and we're somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting more variants in COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, knock on wood, we haven't seen
that with Hop League.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because could that be more of a
problem if it were to start doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would, because all of a sudden you
think you've got this genetic strain
[SPEAKER_01]: that's resistant, and now you've got a new
variant that is more aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, very similar to what we see in
COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why these vaccine companies are
making a fortune, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: this year, again, I already got my little
reminder that I've got to go for my
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is, fourth or fifth vaccine
booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to develop another one,
a different booster for COVID,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they say the strain has changed
since last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're continuously trying to keep up
with this evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned too, so HLVD,
it seems to be a relatively new phenomenon
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wonder, because you've studied a lot
of different pathogens in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: has it been around longer than maybe we
know of, and we just were not aware of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, were you looking at plants and kind
of expecting to find one pathogen and not
[SPEAKER_00]: finding it and being like, hmm,
this doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that you know about HLVD,
now it kind of, the picture is clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's one of those things,
the more you look, the more you find,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But prior to 2018, which is when I started
my work, there were no reports of Hop
[SPEAKER_01]: League.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it was because it hadn't been
discovered, it hadn't been tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hence the two reports out of
California in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: They published in 2019, but the plants
were sampled back in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's been around, I can't say how
long, I would guess maybe five to eight
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow it migrated over from hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly somebody was working with hops and
maybe had sap on their fingers or
[SPEAKER_01]: something happened where it was then moved
over into a cannabis production facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's probably been around,
I don't know, five to eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it hasn't been recognized,
we weren't really looking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I saw a stunted plant, I would look,
oh, that's probably Fusarium or Pythium,
[SPEAKER_01]: not even knowing what Hop League is.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they first mentioned it to me in
2018, I go, ah, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only affects hops, it's latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a mistake that everybody makes
initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we realized, my goodness,
this organism is very well adapted to
[SPEAKER_01]: infect cannabis and cause damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now part of your presentation at
CanMed too, you shared some really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stunning images that you captured with an
electron microscope and with regular
[SPEAKER_00]: photography too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the ones in particular where
you're looking at the trichomes are cool
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm going to try to share my screen
now, we could kind of take a look at those
[SPEAKER_00]: and show the folks if you'll bear with me
for one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess while we're waiting,
I can explain the scanning electron
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope is a very, very powerful piece
of equipment that magnifies things
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendously in the magnitude of
thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you look at trichomes,
as we see here now, you can see these,
[SPEAKER_01]: at this magnification, you could probably
see this with a high magnified hand lens
[SPEAKER_01]: or even under a dissecting microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though this is under a scanning,
this kind of thing I think you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: with a normal microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left side there, you've got the
normal stalks and the large glands or
[SPEAKER_01]: bulbs at the top of the stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over on the right, you can see that
they're smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're there, but they're smaller and
they look like they're not as well
[SPEAKER_01]: developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the numbers are the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what surprised me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at numbers, you actually sit
and count these little dots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're equal numbers on both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people say, oh, well, the trichome
numbers are down, they're not actually
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't developed as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're underdeveloped because of this
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the trichomes themselves,
like that's where the plant produces the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes and everything,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is why the industry is doing
what it's doing is to collect all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and THC and other things that
occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called resin from these glands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anything that disrupts the
development of these glands or makes them
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller or poor quality, then that's going
to affect the ultimate amount of THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD and so on that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when one looks at that, it's basically
the plant is under some kind of stress,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supporting the reproduction of this
viroid, which by the way, it's producing
[SPEAKER_01]: millions and millions of copies of itself
in the cell, in the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no other way of replicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, similar to COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID has mechanisms to replicate in
humans, but it still takes a toll,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: People that suffer from an infection with
COVID are in bed for six or eight days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've lost appetite and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the plant, this thing is taking energy
out of the plant by making millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so partly I think it's the stress
level on the plant and partly it may also
[SPEAKER_01]: be that the viroid is actually shutting
down parts of that pathway that produce
[SPEAKER_01]: these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of research labs doing this
kind of study right now to find out what
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly is being turned off in these
infected plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet you a lot of the genes that are
involved in cannabinoid synthesis are also
[SPEAKER_01]: turned off or downregulated, which would
also explain why we're seeing this reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's not just cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen plants turning yellow,
which means they're lower in chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see plants that are stunted,
which means there's less growth in the
[SPEAKER_01]: apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's other things that happen in
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a really good example of a
particular strain or genotype that is very
[SPEAKER_01]: distinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at that and go, boy, that's
hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure enough, every one of those is
infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can sort of see fewer trichomes on
those surrounding leaves or bracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got less chlorophyll,
which is, again, another effect of this
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and I did want to get to these,
because I think this is some of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: striking images.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that looks like a deflated
balloon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really was happy to get this,
or at least the student, the graduate
[SPEAKER_01]: student and I that worked on this were
really happy to see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing more visual than,
you know, they say a picture paints a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand words.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing more visual than showing a
grower or a producer or regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what hoplatin does.
[SPEAKER_01]: On your left is the healthy, plumped up,
full of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right, it's deflated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It either, it most likely inflated first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way these trichomes develop is that
the outside, the gland itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: the head is inflated first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's the cannabinoids start to
fill it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've got a situation where the
cannabinoids are not filling it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's 40% less, then this thing
will start to collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no oxygen or no, there's no
support within those so-called hotter
[SPEAKER_01]: balloons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the term hotter balloon to describe
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are dried flowers now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the left, you can see the drying
does not impact the structure of the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome gland or the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's intact because the cuticle is really
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the right where you've got hoplatin
infected, because it hasn't inflated
[SPEAKER_01]: completely, it's getting to be like a flat
tire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's no air in there to begin
with, but then when you start drying these
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes down, you see this shriveling
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I first saw this, I thought
that, well, I mean, this is indicative
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you have a shriveled up trichome,
it's not going to be producing as many
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're saying is that this is
just showing that it hasn't been filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with those actual cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the plant is going to go ahead and
create this cavity in order to prepare
[SPEAKER_01]: itself to produce the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually the cannabinoid production
starts when the stock, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom, starts to elongate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been shown by previous studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the stock elongates, that's when
this cavity starts to fill up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now you've got a hoplatin infected
plant, it's not producing as much
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it doesn't fill up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you dry it, you get this
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of you're looking at a plump grape on
the left and the raisin on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are fantastic images for the
very fact that we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's latent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always obvious if you were
looking at a plant that it's got any
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with it, maybe not until you take
it to the lab and get it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you zoom in like you have,
well, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think now we can kind of transition
into talking about, well, we've
[SPEAKER_00]: established the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were a grower and you suspect
that you have an infected plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are your options?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's many things growers can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the first thing they need to do
for sure is confirm that they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever plant they're dealing with,
most likely it's a flowering plant because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's usually when you see it and they
send it off for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing would be to work backwards
and try to figure out where did I get my
[SPEAKER_01]: clones from for that particular plant or
that particular genotype?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I grow it indoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I purchase it from someone else or did
I start it from seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you sort of work backwards,
you can say to yourself, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's assume it came from clones within
your own facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the mother plant definitely has
hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you work backwards, you then test your
mother plants depending on how big they
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can talk about sampling
strategies, but you test your mother
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously if the mother plant is
infected, the bad news is that I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got to be thrown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no proven ways right now to
rescue a plant that has hoplatin in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've talked about Marystem
culture and tissue culture and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible, but it hasn't been
demonstrated on a high level or a high
[SPEAKER_01]: scale that you can rescue a mother plant
that's got hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've proven that it's your mother
plant, then obviously you get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other possibility is that it picked it
up when the plant was in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you're vegging on a table and
if you're using hydroponics, then you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got water or nutrient solution moving
between plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've shown and others have shown that it
can move with water, with recirculating
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a veg plant that's maybe two weeks
old could potentially have picked up
[SPEAKER_01]: hoplatin through the root system and the
viral then makes its way into the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, the last alternative
is a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you started from seed, you didn't test
the plant that came out the seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could be that gave rise to your
infected flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a detective process or a process
of elimination deciding where did it come
[SPEAKER_01]: from?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know that that's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think you kind of answered my
next question, but I think it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to hammer home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really doesn't seem to be any sort
of treatment or kind of remediation
[SPEAKER_00]: options available yet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you've got a heavily infected or
even an infected mother plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: now people have tried and people are
trying taking cuttings from different
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the big plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take them from the top,
the actively growing, you could take it
[SPEAKER_01]: from the side, the bottom, but then you
have to go through and test all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: to see if by chance, and really it is
chance, if by chance you were able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: a clone that was free of hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the virus gets in, and we can discuss
this now, the first place it goes is down
[SPEAKER_01]: into the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say I infected it through
cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went with my tools and I transferred
some sap onto a cut surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first place it goes is down into
the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that takes about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say two weeks after it was
introduced, it goes down into the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from the roots, it's moved
upward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason it's moved upward is it
sort of follows the flow of sugars that
[SPEAKER_01]: are being produced by photosynthesis in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that usually is towards the actively
growing shoots, which are the young
[SPEAKER_01]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll find it in the young shoots
probably around four weeks after that
[SPEAKER_01]: initial infection occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it starts moving around the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say by six weeks, it's now pretty
much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are cases where a branch gets
missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a diseased plant and all of a
sudden a healthy branch on one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I have a photo in that
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can come back to it in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason that branch got missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're lucky enough, you can get a
cutting out of that, a clone out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may have escaped hoply at least in
that particular plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a uniform distribution
throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some producers will go through and
take clones from various parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plant in the hopes that they can
find a few that don't have the violin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is effective?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously they all have to be
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have to be tested because you
don't know for sure whether you lucked out
[SPEAKER_01]: or whether it's dormant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's there, but it hasn't had a
chance to grow out and replicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Mary stem culture, which is taking
the very, very, very small tip,
[SPEAKER_01]: does seem to work in many other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in potato, particularly here in Canada,
when we had an outbreak of potato spindle
[SPEAKER_01]: tuber viroid back in the 80s, the
government stepped in and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody's going to be able to grow any
potatoes unless they all came from a
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue cultured Mary stem plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they started this Mary stem program
throughout Canada and only growers that
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased these plants that were
propagated through tissue culture could
[SPEAKER_01]: grow potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, it got wiped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can hardly find that in most
commercial fields because of this rigorous
[SPEAKER_01]: insistence on using clean plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, with cannabis, it's hard to do
because we have to show that those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause one of the things that you mentioned
in your presentation is that sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: only real way to get rid of an infection,
if you have it in your facility is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: this systematic testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And removing of infected plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering like sort of what is the
protocol for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, which plants should be tested
and, you know, is it all of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the ones that sort of appear sick,
just the ones that are kind of in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: vicinity as some confirmed positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are sort of the best best practices
in developing that testing protocol?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely systematic, a systematic
approach has to be taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one that where the growers is taking a
lot of records so they can follow through
[SPEAKER_01]: what exactly happened from A to B to C.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first place, definitely starting with
the mother plants and testing those to see
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're clean and whether they may
accidentally have picked up hoplite and
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the second place to test would
be your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow if some viroid got through and
wasn't detected in the mothers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may see symptoms in that veg plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they are a little bit shorter,
may have slightly curled leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, being very vigilant about what
the plants are supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most growers have had years of
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may look at that plant because,
you know, that's not growing right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I not fertilize it properly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it not getting enough light?
[SPEAKER_01]: It may actually be infected with hoplite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not test necessarily flowering
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only if you want to make sure that you've
got it or don't have it, because at that
[SPEAKER_01]: stage it's too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a whole lot you can gain from
testing a flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get rid of it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly the mothers and the veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now clones, when you test clones,
they should be rooted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get a bunch of unrooted clones
from someone and you want to get it tested
[SPEAKER_01]: for hoplite, I would suggest rooting them
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they are infected, the first
place the virus is going to go is back
[SPEAKER_01]: down into the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've shown when you've got a two week
old rooted cutting that if it came from a
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plant, you will find it in the
roots 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not find it in the leaves,
the leaves that may originally have had
[SPEAKER_01]: the bioroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may have tested it and found a
negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say root it, get the roots coming
out, take those samples off those,
[SPEAKER_01]: set them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they come back negative, it's negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it comes back positive, throw it out.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and a lot of people do import a lot of
clones and most of them tend to be not
[SPEAKER_01]: rooted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root them first and then test them and
then get rid of the ones that turn out
[SPEAKER_01]: positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beauty about the root sampling is it's
A, more sensitive at that early stage
[SPEAKER_01]: because the roots are starting to
accumulate that bioroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later on, when that plant grows up,
so let's say it's now six weeks old,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can find the bioroid everywhere in the
leaves, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about how it takes two weeks to
go down, four weeks, and then six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a recent paper that came out
that basically says you can test leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only if that plant is old enough,
you know, it's six weeks, eight weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 weeks old, and it's had a chance to
spread the bioroid in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's an early plant, a clone or a veg
plant, go for the roots because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where you'll very likely find it because
it hasn't had a chance to move out into
[SPEAKER_01]: the foliage as yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess further complicating
things, because I know that some
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments that we've done or our team
has done, we've seen plants where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: detectable in the roots but never actually
makes it up into the upper leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could be tolerance that we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, if it's in a hydroponic
system and those roots are in the water
[SPEAKER_00]: and that water is circulating,
well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have your asymptomatic spreader,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're bang on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it does go down to the roots,
we can use that as a consistent method for
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's not to say that it's
necessarily going to move into the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now everything we work with is highly
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've never seen a situation yet where
it's in the roots but eventually doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: find its way into the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a tolerance or a resistance,
which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is fighting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's keeping it localized, doesn't want it
to spread up into the leaves and flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But environment plays a pretty important
role in terms of how it moves from the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots into the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we find, for example, when you flip or
when you turn the lights into 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_01]: light and 12 hours of dark, that plant
that only has viroids in the roots all of
[SPEAKER_01]: a sudden will start showing it really fast
in the leaves and the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it may be that flow of sugar
that's being triggered by the flipping of
[SPEAKER_01]: the lights that's causing this movement
back into the upper leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing some experiments now where
I'm putting plants in the darkness,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting plants in full light,
I'm putting plants at different
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, trying to see if I have a
root infection what's it going to take to
[SPEAKER_01]: move that viroid up into the upper part of
a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because maybe we can play around with
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmental conditions might reduce the
rate of spread, as well as genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I would think particularly
in the cases of a mother plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: where if you're taking cuttings from the
canopy, from the leaves, even if it were
[SPEAKER_00]: to have an infection in the roots that
never got to those leaves, could produce
[SPEAKER_00]: clean clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretically.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to go back to sort of like
that testing protocol you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you said start with the moms and to
test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we looking at for sampling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I guess it's kind of a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should you be testing the roots or the
actual branches that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: taking cuttings from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: So right up until this past year,
the entire industry was sampling leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with what they were
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these years, all the testing labs that
I know of were either taking leaves or
[SPEAKER_01]: petioles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Petioles seem to be a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Petioles are the connections that the
leaves have to the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, it's the vascular system,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows the movement of the sugar in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were finding, hopefully,
all the reports that we have pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: are based on leaf testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big mother plant, they're saying four
samples, either four samples through
[SPEAKER_01]: various parts of the plant, either
separate or you can combine them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll give you one composite sample
and maybe save you a bit of money because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not testing individual samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're combining the tissues into one
tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root system on one of these larger
moms is harder to get to because really
[SPEAKER_01]: the ideal sampling location is the root
system more towards the central stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so digging out in there and causing
some potential damage may not be worth the
[SPEAKER_01]: effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a larger mom, and I'm going to say
two months and older, you're probably okay
[SPEAKER_01]: with taking these four leaf samples or
petioles samples and combining them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything younger than that, where it's
still potentially in the roots and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't spread uniformly, I would go with
the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would definitely be clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would definitely be veg plants and
potentially plants that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: save for future moms that are six,
maybe eight weeks old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: On an established mother that is in your
nursery, you've had for maybe three years,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long growers keep these
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves will probably do a good job if
your sampling is systematically done
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how frequently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, should you be testing monthly or
just when you're taking cuttings?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your advice there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess it's going to depend on
whether you've got the same moms that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using over and over, in which case
I wouldn't really sample them more than
[SPEAKER_01]: once a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's an established mother,
if it's a younger, vegetative plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: grows rapidly and you're just about ready
to take it in the flower, I would test it
[SPEAKER_01]: again after two weeks from the first test,
just to see whether you may have missed
[SPEAKER_01]: something and it's outgrown itself since.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to vary from two weeks to
four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some growers like to sample every
week just to be absolutely sure that they
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't missed a potential positive,
because I guess if you missed it and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to go into the flower room,
you've lost a lot of potential revenue by
[SPEAKER_01]: not having tested that one plant as
opposed to paying whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: $50 for an extra sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they may do it every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think every two weeks on actively
growing plants and every four weeks or
[SPEAKER_01]: once a month on plants that are larger and
perhaps not growing as rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be, I'm sorry, say again,
which ones would be roots, which ones
[SPEAKER_00]: would be leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely the younger plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything I would say younger than about
six weeks, do the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, do the roots, because they're
still growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still developing root systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still trying to move the viral.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are plants that are older,
three months and older, the leaves should
[SPEAKER_01]: be fine, as long as there are multiple
samples, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At least four that are combined or set in
separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly for the roots, we find if
you take three or four small root samples
[SPEAKER_01]: and combine them into one, that one result
is good enough to tell you whether the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's infected or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is this same protocol applicable
if you have a known infection or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you know you've got infected
plants, do you up your testing or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, technically that infected plant
shouldn't be in your facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've decided to keep it,
then definitely I would test it every
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, not necessarily if you kept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have a grow now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's coming back negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm finding, oh no, a few plants
over in this corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I do more testing to make sure to
kind of mitigate this spread somehow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if it's a definite positive,
I would move it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would move it into another room and then
decide what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't leave it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's interesting because I haven't
seen any data yet to suggest that the
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid moves very effectively down the
road, for example, if somebody's walking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say if your clothes brush up against
the plant, I don't know that that is
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficient damage to the leaves to move
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does for many viruses and viroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there may be data out there,
but I haven't seen it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I say that is because I've
walked into facilities where the we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: a few infected plants here, there,
and everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this thing was moving with people
brushing up against the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: every damn plant in that location would be
infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finding isolated spots here,
there, and everywhere that may have been
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced through a pruning tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: SAP, the movement of SAP is super
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you brush up against a plant,
there really is no SAP being released or
[SPEAKER_01]: on your clothes that's going to react on a
wound on another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But SAP on your tools and SAP on your
gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got obvious SAP stuck to your
gloves and you touch another plant and you
[SPEAKER_01]: damage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will transmit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damage is the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tissue has to be damaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I think that it has to be the
vascular system has to be exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, there has to be a broken
vein or a broken off leaf that allows that
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid to enter in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just putting the viroid on the
surface of a leaf and letting it sit,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe is going to cause an
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to have the wounding and
you've got to have the SAP and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these plants could have picked it up if
there was recirculating water that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid in it and somehow got into root
contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the viroids spread
within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So recirculating water is a problem
because I haven't seen any treatments yet
[SPEAKER_01]: that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even 100 degrees centigrade heating
doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: UV doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluorination doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know yet what treatments could be
made to water to clean it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: recirculating water yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's obviously a lot of
companies working on that and eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll have an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, we have to be super careful
with water that's being recirculated from
[SPEAKER_01]: an infected mother or plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that seems like a massive issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in terms of that, so in addition to
testing plants, you should be testing your
[SPEAKER_00]: water and your surfaces, your equipment,
things like that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so definitely if you're
recirculating and you know you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: high incidence of hot latent, you're
almost guaranteed to have it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: recirculating water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've got to remember it's not pure
water that has the viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's little flakes of small pieces of
roots and organic matter and debris that's
[SPEAKER_01]: come off the roots, that's sloughed off,
that's carrying the viroid in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the water is recirculated,
it's still got little bit of particles and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff in it that potentially has the
viroid in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen it on surfaces, for example,
on flood tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a plant that's sitting on a
table and there's water up against the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots on the bottom, you can find hot
latent on the surface of that table,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as, of course, on tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that, cleaning bleach does a pretty
good job or work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2%, because that comes in direct contact
with the water or the film of water that's
[SPEAKER_01]: on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can eliminate hot latent viroid quite
effectively on tools and on the surfaces
[SPEAKER_01]: of tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of what does it do to sap,
if there's infected sap, I don't know how
[SPEAKER_01]: effective vercon or bleach are at this
stage, where you've got visible sap being
[SPEAKER_01]: moved from plant to plant, whether those
two chemicals will completely eradicate
[SPEAKER_01]: the viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for surfaces, there's definitely
materials out there that will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in terms of testing, I think you
mentioned before PCR, QPCR, the gold
[SPEAKER_00]: standard for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the option that you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most labs realize that, and they've
geared their methodologies to test using
[SPEAKER_01]: QPCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no other effective rapid
test that will work for hot latent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we covered a lot, Samir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be definitely mindful of your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anything we missed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give up hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like everything else and just like
COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people, obviously,
that don't necessarily believe in COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we've got a good handle on it
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say that it's not going to be a
problem later on, but we've got a good
[SPEAKER_01]: handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put a lot of good science into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We threw a lot of money at it,
and it's under control.
[SPEAKER_01]: With hot latent, I think it's a similar
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put some good science into it,
get some money going that can fund
[SPEAKER_01]: research and help companies develop
products that will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers, in general, are very astute.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they know they've got a problem,
they'll find every means they can to
[SPEAKER_01]: address it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're starting to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to see, for example,
that certain strains or certain genotypes
[SPEAKER_01]: are more resilient than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to start using that in their
crosses or they're going to start using
[SPEAKER_01]: that to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they know it's in the seed,
they're going to be doing seed testing or
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to be buying seed from a
location that hasn't necessarily certified
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're buying clones, they're
going to be a little bit more careful
[SPEAKER_01]: about the sources of their clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they've got an outbreak, they're going
to do everything they can, including
[SPEAKER_01]: people wearing proper clothes and wearing
gloves and sanitizing their tools and so
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you use a combination of these
things, it's not going to go away,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's manageable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you understand, obviously,
the more you can manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know numbers now are scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety percent of California production
has it, fifty percent in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are scary numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think as we learn more about this
thing in a couple of years, maybe I won't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do these webinars or podcasts
anymore because it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, two years ago, I think you
mentioned 2018 when I spoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hop Layton was never on the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Fusarium was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Fusarium was big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Empowering Millenium and Petritis,
which are still big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's Hop Layton.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2025, hopefully it's under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as long as we have people like you
doing this work and sharing the
[SPEAKER_00]: information, it's the best we can hope
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zemir, before I let you go, if there are
any other resources about this that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to share or websites or
anything where people can visit to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more about the work that you're doing or
maybe even just work that you're a fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: that you think would be apropos of the
conversation, please share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think my latest, obviously,
is the CanMed 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the most recent data is
presented there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, medicinal genomics has a good
website for a lot of information
[SPEAKER_01]: pertaining to Hop Layton Biroid,
as well as Toomey Genomics has a really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice website that you can visit that has a
lot of information on management and
[SPEAKER_01]: symptomology and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of these labs obviously offer
testing services.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's others.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other labs out there that are
obviously getting onto the bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tremendous amount of information
that's being put together on these
[SPEAKER_01]: websites in the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really impressed with how much
knowledge we have, you know, taken maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: from other systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the really important part here
is the sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sharing of information has been
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you guys do a good job of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toomey Genomics has done a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to do the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do that anyway, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the university, we like to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to see these other companies get
involved is really gratifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's hiding anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's keeping things to themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all out there discussing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way we got to make
progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we are making progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hopeful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be out of a job in two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's lots to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll be all right, Samir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always have a home at CanMed,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Samir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, we're going to be doing
another one of these soon, talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then, thanks again.
