[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much to the 10 people that
stayed to the end of the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny that Stacey, even when she's
not here, she's taking time off my talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: She have this ability to overcome me
always.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing is that she wasn't funny as
usual, so I'm more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's top scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I admire her work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by saying that, hi, if somebody don't
know me, how many of you were yesterday in
[SPEAKER_00]: the talk?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much overlap I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see anything, but good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried, since I gave a talk yesterday,
I tried to change part of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sorry for the people that were
yesterday and so part of the things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm trying to show the same path or
things that I believe, but in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody doesn't know me,
I'm Professor of the Technion,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the Technology Institute of
Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Altogether, we're around 90 scientists
that working on this project that I'm show
[SPEAKER_00]: you, which is mainly chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, my lab is also doing algae
work, like plant biology in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that this is my first slide,
meaning that they didn't put the newest
[SPEAKER_00]: version that I gave him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will manage that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I will go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I established my lab eight years ago,
I started to work with, I have a PhD in
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular and plant biology, and I did
postdoc in cancer research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I established my lab,
I wanted to create kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: multidisciplinary lab that will work on a
plant that affecting cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the plants that were there outside,
mainly by work by Manuel Guzman and
[SPEAKER_00]: Christine Sanchez, was this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to work with that and we
got really good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going further seven years,
first of all, most of my work and my
[SPEAKER_00]: students working on this plant,
but we create the multidisciplinary lab
[SPEAKER_00]: that doing everything from extraction to
analyzing the molecules, understanding how
[SPEAKER_00]: they affect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that, it's not that I
chose that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my license from the Israeli
government to do a cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my name, Professor Omairi David,
my faculty of biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is somebody here that don't know
to read Hebrew, I'm translating,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though you know the bribe and
everything you should.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my name, Professor Omairi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the number of the license,
R for research, 0001, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Rafi Meshulam that in 65
started to work with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't ask for license, just went and take
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2007, the cannabis moved to the health
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014, I was the first one to apply for a
license, so no collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a license to work in room 401,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to the microscope in the
first floor, I'm a criminal and I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But for that, I didn't have any choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send it to the chemistry
department to check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't use your friend LCMS to do
metabolomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything need to be in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the reason my lab become a lab
that actually had to do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of criticism in-house about
that, that I'm doing everything and
[SPEAKER_00]: multidisciplinary, but it's not my fault,
it's this plant fault, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: He multidisciplinary, it's multimedia,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis, as you all know, oh no,
sorry, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm professor of the Technology Institute
of Israel, and this is how it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never succeed to work with these kind of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis, and I gave that as an example
yesterday, people don't understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is actually not really growing in
the nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a plant biology, there is no reason for
this plant to create 20, 30, 35% in its
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have many plants that produce
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will produce 0.1, 0.2, this is
lipophilic, very sticky molecules when the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, there is a male and a female,
the wind is pollinated by the wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen is flying and is attaching,
sticking by this molecule to the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need 0.1, 0.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we have such an amount that
because people did breeding for thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of years with this plant and create
something like we do with dogs,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are wolf, and this is a wolf dog,
very similar, but how do the hell we reach
[SPEAKER_00]: this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cannabis, to my opinion,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm teaching genetics in the medical
school, and I'm teaching mutations and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, yeah, mutation changing,
and they're showing this and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: how the hell we reach that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is cannabis, and cannabis
harboring a lot of these molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: phyto-cannabinoids, and phyto-cannabinoids
were discovered by Rafi Mishurim,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to say any word about that,
but they're affecting our endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I spoke about that yesterday,
the endocannabinoid system is way wider
[SPEAKER_00]: than I think 90% of the audience here,
and it's not a lot, knows, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that Sulek and other people
understand it, but many people think that
[SPEAKER_00]: two receptors, CB1, CB2, two, three
molecules, anandamide, 2AG, I'm teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: in Israel in order to be physicians that
prescribe cannabis, you need to pass a
[SPEAKER_00]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, pharmacies, or nurses, and I'm
teaching in these courses the most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons there, but before, after me,
there is the head of the Ministry of
[SPEAKER_00]: Health that's responsible to cannabis,
and I'm teaching three hours, the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies, about the endocannabinoids,
where they're expressing the enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking them, and then, you know,
90 some endocannabinoids, 160
[SPEAKER_00]: phyto-cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The head of the Ministry of Health that's
responsible to cannabis come after me,
[SPEAKER_00]: said, daddy, thank you very much,
always amazing talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a difference between what's
happened in the lab and reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the lab, daddy told you what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, there are two cannabinoids and
two receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spoil, you know, don't spoil the
physician, think there is more than two
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an extremely, extremely
complicated system, every cell in our body
[SPEAKER_00]: harboring the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab is working around 35 receptors that
are participating in the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can analyze in the blood samples around
90 some endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Altogether, we think there is around 130,
140, there is something like 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we call them endocannabinoids,
like very complicated system that
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing, keeping homo-stasis on our
body, okay, actually is a communication
[SPEAKER_00]: between two cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cell sends a signal to other cells,
create appetite, reduce pain, affect
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep, reduce, increase insulin and so on
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: One part is the ligand, the
endocannabinoid, the other part is protein
[SPEAKER_00]: called receptors, capture that,
send a signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis was just unlucky to produce
similar compounds and we create a poodle,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, it's just producing
similar compound and binding these
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors and send signaling that our body
know how to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our problem that we don't know enough
about the endocannabinoid system and the
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling, and more important,
we don't know which molecules from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is mimicking the process that we
don't know what the endocannabinoid is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going and disappearing,
but in the last seven years, I saw I think
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 500 startup companies that claim
that they know which doing what,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's take me 30 seconds to break them
apart, like we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly, we're starting to understand a
little bit CBD, THC, CBG, not to the depth
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the problem that cannabis is
not one plant, in my lab only,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have more than 1,000 different chemo
virus of cannabis, I'm the dream of every
[SPEAKER_00]: stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I'm not a user.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to work now with psilocybin
mushroom, maybe this will be effective for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is tons of chemo virus,
each one of them contain different
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of molecules and we don't know
to match the right flower to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: bribe, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And after 25 years of marriage,
I can talk about matching flowers to the
[SPEAKER_00]: right bride and what's happened to the
right bride after 24 years, but this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how to match the flowers and
this is actually the problem to connect
[SPEAKER_00]: all these dots, endocannabinoids,
receptors affecting the endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids, the chemo virus,
we are far from understanding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my talk today was how to match that,
but I'm run out of time, so I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: we will read that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to show you how me and my lab
and my team trying to approach this
[SPEAKER_00]: question in three different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way is when we have a question on
something that we have zero knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer, how to?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will skip that, so this is saying that,
no, here, no, no, no, yes, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You born with English, we are starting to
learn in grade four, I think, English and
[SPEAKER_00]: the first lesson called, yes, no
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a joke in Hebrew, yes,
no questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we start?
[SPEAKER_00]: We started, first of all, creating tools
to do this research and I will skip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created tools to analyze all the
fetocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can analyze 11 different families
altogether around 160 fetocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that also to the endocannabinoid
system, taking the blood samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue or biopsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can analyze around, as I said,
around 100, a little bit, more
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're participating in almost 20 clinical
trials when we're getting blood samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, to start to get a profile of these
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with Stacy, getting from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to put our hands,
I won't touch this at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is, I want to show in the 17
minutes that I have, three approaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: how we succeed, how we're trying to match
the right flower, the right combination to
[SPEAKER_00]: the right indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing, if we don't know anything,
we don't know, we don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: information from patients how cannabis is
affecting real cancer, okay, for an
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to test how cannabis is
affecting leukemia, breast cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: colon cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing that, we can grow cells in
plate like that, we can grow cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is cells in the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one cell, you know, the dark side
inside is a nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody don't know how cells look in a
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grow cells in a plate, plate like
that contain between three to 10 million
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, depend on the types of the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow cells also in plates that have
many wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have equipment to run these fast and
screen these wells and get an input.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into that just because this
frightening clock is going down very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally every second it's three seconds
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can screen it very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ask how it's affecting leukemia,
we know that cannabis is affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of data from Crohn,
Colitis disease, autoimmune disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that cannabis is affecting the
immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're asking how cannabis is affecting
the cancer of the immune system,
[SPEAKER_00]: leukemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier a PhD student in my lab started
to work with TLL, this is a specific type
[SPEAKER_00]: of leukemia and it took a TLL cell that
growing in the cell screen about that
[SPEAKER_00]: around 200 different cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every color it's a different strain and
we see viability, so if the line is lower
[SPEAKER_00]: the meaning that more cells are dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that in two microgram per ml
most of the cannabis strains didn't affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells at all but there was one buster
that killed these cells like hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said okay, leukemia it's a given
name to many different types of diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are TLL and CLL and BLL and I won't
go into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how it's affecting in a long
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took this extract, extract number 12
and they joke in the lab that they screen
[SPEAKER_00]: around 300 but extract 12 was the good one
so we can stop at 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we screened that on 10 different
leukemias and we saw that in 50% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leukemias the cannabis is not affecting
but in 50% of them it's kill like very
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a genetic screening and we saw that
every time there is specific mutation
[SPEAKER_00]: called notch one mutation the cannabis is
killing the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time that there is no mutation on
different mutation it's not affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In TLL 50% almost 60% of the patient will
harbor notch one mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notch one is a protein sitting on the
membrane and in general if I'm flattening
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's feeling that there is another
cell near him and that there is something
[SPEAKER_00]: called contact inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is cells around you you won't
proliferate and create another cells but
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cells which become crazy one of the
things that happened they're losing this
[SPEAKER_00]: contact inhibition proliferate and create
a tumor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So notch one in the normal place he's
standing feeling think this is three
[SPEAKER_00]: dimension there is many proteins feeling
the cells around them and they're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is no cell it's vacant in time
there is other protein can cleave that
[SPEAKER_00]: notch one become transcription factor
going to the nucleus and push create other
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins to proliferate and defend on the
cells never mind the biology about that
[SPEAKER_00]: but also he send a new notch one back to
the membrane because he was cleaved you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to create a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeing that the extract number 12 is
very effective we went to a mice model we
[SPEAKER_00]: create the tumor you see a CT of the mice
with a tumor in his back, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We create this tumor we treat them with
extract number 12 the black line on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left is the size of the tumors that
they're treating with a vehicle with a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of placebo and not placebo with a
control you see the size is growing
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially the gray line is the size of
the tumor treating with the extract number
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 it didn't affect them in the middle is
the stat of the mice the right size is the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the tumor after three week
treatment they are shrinking because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is leukemia we did a bone marrow
implantation we doubled the lifespan of
[SPEAKER_00]: these mice we did actually five different
models of a mice model to this including
[SPEAKER_00]: primary cells directly from the patient to
the mice it's work very efficiently,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the 100 million dollar question from
all of these compounds from these extract
[SPEAKER_00]: do we need all of them then to write the
rash effect do we need one, three,
[SPEAKER_00]: five my slogan to my students I want to
know the minimum compounds they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum effect it may be one it may be
five, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how we're doing that we're taking these
extracts and we're cutting into pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing fractions, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We said okay there is 100 compounds where
the equipment to separate them to 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, 25, 25 we're going back to the cells
or to the mice and you can see the vehicle
[SPEAKER_00]: the control is not killing the cells
extract number 12 is very efficient and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the fourth fraction and Ellie was
more lucky than smart that fraction number
[SPEAKER_00]: two worked as good as the whole extract
already eliminating 75% of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids these are the biochemistry
behind that not important we keep doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that and in the end we succeed to isolate
three phyto cannabinoids that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate them make them synthetic or
whatever 100 purified you put them
[SPEAKER_00]: together you get exactly the same effect
as the whole extract but every combination
[SPEAKER_00]: this is this the left side the low a bar
left side if you every combination of one
[SPEAKER_00]: of them or two of them are not working as
good as they are and the three of them
[SPEAKER_00]: together we did a lot of work a lot of
biochemistry to understand the mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: of action I don't have time to show that
but the bottom line we understand today
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly why you need the three of them
actually we did what we called synergism
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and two of them CBD and CBD,
CBDV are additive you can replace one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them by increase the other so we don't
need the both of them we can reduce it to
[SPEAKER_00]: two molecules in the extract we need the
both of them because it's additive but if
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking purified is enough too but the
other one a unique cannabinoid we call
[SPEAKER_00]: them 3318 he's a derivative of CBD very
different structure and CBD and him
[SPEAKER_00]: binding two different receptors who are
binding CB2 and TRPV1 activating proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: called seramidin in the cell that creating
ER stress elevating three different
[SPEAKER_00]: protein 84 chop and chakwan, chakwan is
going to the Golgi and blocking not trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to go back mature to the to the membrane
again I know don't know how many physician
[SPEAKER_00]: or biologists are here in the crowd so I'm
trying not to go to deep biology I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to transfer the idea that we know
exactly why when there is a notch one
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation cannabis will kill the cells it's
not anymore we think maybe we know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: why when there is no mutation it won't
affect the cells when there is mutation
[SPEAKER_00]: why these cells committing suicide to the
bottom of the mechanism of action and from
[SPEAKER_00]: that point I can convince any hematologist
to try to use it on his patient to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: read clinical trial to prove it on humans
and that's what we're doing most important
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to understand that if now we're
saying yes cannabis can kill cancer I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just show you that from 300 different
extract just one of them was effective on
[SPEAKER_00]: from this one is affecting just of 50% of
the of the patient so what is the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: success of a patient that going to a
dispensary and pick the right cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: true to kill the right cancer it's a
lottery and it's not that I don't believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis can be effective to cancer
but I don't believe that it's killing
[SPEAKER_00]: every type of cancer in every type of
cannabis I think there is a lot of work to
[SPEAKER_00]: match the right flower to the right
disease so we open a company and we raise
[SPEAKER_00]: money and we are going clinical trial with
that and there is two pathway one pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: to take extract number 12 and treat the
patient and actually in Israel if your
[SPEAKER_00]: oncology patient you immediately get
prescription for cannabis in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce pain nausea increase appetite so
actually the patient today if your
[SPEAKER_00]: oncology patient you get the prescription
you can go and take extract number 12 it's
[SPEAKER_00]: on the shelf so I don't need to start
safety I can go directly to the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: work with them with the oncologist to just
match it so quite fast in a year year and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half I can be after pure see proof of
concept that this extract working on this
[SPEAKER_00]: patient checking notch one and everything
the other direction is far them farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: direction if somebody want to dare donate
to me a 200 million dollars I will do that
[SPEAKER_00]: also we're doing a that but I'm looking
for the donation so this was when we know
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing we're starting what cannabis will
fit to Alzheimer to leukemia we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge but there is another way if I
have previous knowledge in 2015 I got five
[SPEAKER_00]: million dollars to do the Israeli database
on patient having the ability to know all
[SPEAKER_00]: the compounds I apply and said I'm the
only one in the world that actually knows
[SPEAKER_00]: what the patient is getting not just you
know white widow and black forest I can
[SPEAKER_00]: look on the molecules so we got five
million dollars to create the database on
[SPEAKER_00]: all the product that patient get it can
get there was just eight authorized
[SPEAKER_00]: growers around 80 to 90 products and we
had agreement that every time that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: picking a batch or creating a new a
product it will come to our lab to analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the other hand we follow up on the
patient and create a database a shitty one
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately almost worth nothing and I
can give a good talk about two hours how
[SPEAKER_00]: to spend five million dollars but it's
gave me a tool to start to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: where really cannabis is affecting what
are the strains that are better so now I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to start to scream 300 strains
if I want to work on sleep disorder I can
[SPEAKER_00]: choose I will skip that I can choose one
strain that I know that is the best for
[SPEAKER_00]: the for the patient and start from there
and again I run off the time I will said
[SPEAKER_00]: we create a screening on the mice it's
very funny and sorry for the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: heard that yesterday we are following on
three different parts of sleep disorder
[SPEAKER_00]: when a mice is sleeping when these is a
light and is awake when this dark so when
[SPEAKER_00]: you turning on the light the mice with
arranges bed it will take around 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes to arrange his bed it's a very
funny thing because there is a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between male and female the
female will arrange a bed around 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes the move the male will arrange his
bed around seven minutes literally after I
[SPEAKER_00]: heard that I want to do an experiment I
want to see how much times take the male
[SPEAKER_00]: to arrange his bed when the female is
around between 10 to 11 minutes okay he's
[SPEAKER_00]: not doing the full exercise but he's
better okay so we separate them and we
[SPEAKER_00]: follow up how much time is take them to
arrange his bed how much time and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: sleeping the duration and also a mice is
lifting his head around every two minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: to look around there is no mice and no cat
around so we are measuring these three
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters one is giving you idea how fast
or how tired he is second how deep his
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep is and the third one is the duration
of sleep so we taking we choosing we
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing these are the strain that we
chose and we started with the strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: worked the best to the patient so we
already know that it's work this strain is
[SPEAKER_00]: working on humans now we're going backward
to the mice to check what is doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: effect so this is a strain that was very
effective the purple one is the control
[SPEAKER_00]: green red and blue are different batches
of this strain that was very efficient by
[SPEAKER_00]: creating the mice to be very tired and go
to sleep a fast also increase the duration
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sleep and and again the question
these are all the molecules in this strain
[SPEAKER_00]: which one which of the molecules doing
this effect and the same methodology from
[SPEAKER_00]: here we doing a fractionation cutting
these two pieces and I will skip that
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have just another two minutes
and I want to show more things we started
[SPEAKER_00]: to fraction we cut out the THC it's work
the same we said okay there is also quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of CBN and CBG we cut the CBN out
it's still work the same we said okay
[SPEAKER_00]: let's cut now the CBG and the other we
left with just two molecules both of them
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown molecules and these more two
molecules working as good as the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: extract and this is when we are now we
know exactly which molecules are there
[SPEAKER_00]: there are two unknown molecules derivates
of a THC and CBN but never mind the
[SPEAKER_00]: details we call them we calling them GTS
go to sleep one and go to sleep two maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll change the name I'm not sure but
this is where we are and from here again
[SPEAKER_00]: we have two paths to go one of them is to
tank the extract to cut it in here to take
[SPEAKER_00]: out the THC take out the CBN left with the
part of the extract zero THC zero CBN but
[SPEAKER_00]: still effective of sleep and I can tell
you that the big population of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have problem to sleep don't want to take
cannabis because of the THC my mother my
[SPEAKER_00]: father a lot of people and this is a new
product zero THC zero CBD still extract
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of cannabinoids but very
efficient to put you asleep second again
[SPEAKER_00]: is a farmer way take these cannabinoids go
farmer direction and so on so this was
[SPEAKER_00]: second methods first method if you don't
know anything second method if you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea on something you can start with a
strain that you know that is affecting
[SPEAKER_00]: from human try to isolate and to find why
is effective and the third one is more
[SPEAKER_00]: bioinformatics tool so again from the
database we collected we saw that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: no indication in Israel for migraine but
we saw that many patient whether they are
[SPEAKER_00]: PTSD patient cancer patient also say that
they are suffering from migraine and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis help them so we looked on just on
these patient around 500 and we send these
[SPEAKER_00]: patient questionnaire for migraine and we
know that the endocannabinoid system is
[SPEAKER_00]: important in the role of creating and
preventing migraine so it's make sense the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis will be effective of that so we
collect data from these patient on the
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine and we try to divide which strain
are not helping or create a migrant to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more severe in which strains are helping
on the strength of helping because we know
[SPEAKER_00]: all the molecules we try to look which
molecules are appearing in all the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that are there we find five molecules that
are unique molecules and not the major one
[SPEAKER_00]: that are appearing in most of the strains
that reduce migraine we looked on them we
[SPEAKER_00]: gave them there we started to look where
they are we analyzing them we separate
[SPEAKER_00]: them we understand the structure of each
one of them and now after we understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the structure we doing modeling about
which one of them probably will bind the
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors that affecting migraine I won't
go there into that oh it's nice now the
[SPEAKER_00]: time is going up so I have lots of time so
I'm done in 15 minutes two minutes so we
[SPEAKER_00]: know the mechanism we know it's not the
mechanism of migrant in part is known we
[SPEAKER_00]: know which receptors in the brain are
responsible to to migrant there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment for that so we did now modeling
about these five molecules that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: which one we think will bind these
receptors and which one will fit to the
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors after we find out which one of
them we isolated that and tested now in
[SPEAKER_00]: cell model in mice model that it's really
binding first of all that it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: binding the receptors and after we find
these binding their receptors it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting the activity of the receptors
and reducing the migrant so we started
[SPEAKER_00]: with totally bioinformatics from the
knowledge with when until we find the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules and now we prove that it's
really working after we find it we can
[SPEAKER_00]: modulate these molecules doing a
chemically changes and know this crowd
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like it but we taking synthetically
modified it that it's will actually we
[SPEAKER_00]: work better but more of that trying to see
if other cannabinoids can work together
[SPEAKER_00]: again bioinformatically and we improving
the affinity and activity of these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules 100 times more active than the
one we really found in the beginning in
[SPEAKER_00]: the in the plant so summarizing what I
showed I think that cannabis is harboring
[SPEAKER_00]: what we called polypharmacology okay and
again yesterday I had time to explain that
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go deeper to that I think for
people use plants for thousands of years
[SPEAKER_00]: as a medicine but in the last hundred
years we know which plans affecting what
[SPEAKER_00]: and in pharma company isolate molecules
and we call it single molecule single
[SPEAKER_00]: target create a medicine from that and
more than 50% of the medicine where these
[SPEAKER_00]: are chemotherapy like tax or vincrestin
where there are a medicine to reduce fever
[SPEAKER_00]: like aspirin coming from plants but it's
single molecule single compound single
[SPEAKER_00]: target in the last 20 years we starting to
see that there are diseases that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to affect them to attack them and
to modulate them in more than one target
[SPEAKER_00]: more than one area okay wonder more one
direction and we call it polypharmacology
[SPEAKER_00]: we still in pharma in in in medicine doing
that on medicine that each one of them was
[SPEAKER_00]: authorized as a medicine then we combining
them cancer is a classic example when we
[SPEAKER_00]: give more than one commodity with the we
giving kind of a cocktail C plus T plus B
[SPEAKER_00]: or plus biologic okay one is attacking the
DNA one is blocking the cytoskeleton one
[SPEAKER_00]: is blocking the receptors and we treating
the patient like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think about plants they are
harboring inside of them polypharmacology
[SPEAKER_00]: the physician three thousand four thousand
years ago looks like that if you come with
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation he wouldn't give you one
molecule he will pick one flower from here
[SPEAKER_00]: one root from here one leaf from here
combine them together and we'd give you
[SPEAKER_00]: something that he create as a
polypharmacology maybe 80% of this is is
[SPEAKER_00]: placebo but also it's laying about a lot
of data that been acquired by these
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments and I believe that the next
step of complicate medicines that will
[SPEAKER_00]: overcome diseases that we can treat like
ALS Alzheimer types of cancer and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on will come from complicate
treatment and plants are harboring that
[SPEAKER_00]: inside we already have this knowledge now
we need to understand why it's working for
[SPEAKER_00]: that okay so the change that happened in
the last 20 years is computers
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding different route
understanding networks today can be done
[SPEAKER_00]: in computers very efficient that 20 years
ago it's well almost impossible and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think this is the next step what I think
cannabis did cannabis is actually an
[SPEAKER_00]: orchestra of molecules that acting on
different receptors in very complicate way
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think if people think that Rafi
Meshulam need to get a Nobel Prize because
[SPEAKER_00]: he found the cannabinoids I think he need
to get the Nobel Prize because he opened
[SPEAKER_00]: the gate for all of us to understand the
complexity of plant biology of
[SPEAKER_00]: polypharmacology cannabis give us the
tools open the mind of physician to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: with complex to treat with plants and gave
us the tools laboratories like mine to
[SPEAKER_00]: start to do it even more on other plants
not that they think that I have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis I think way after my
retirement there was a lot of work to do
[SPEAKER_00]: just with cannabis but I think the message
is way way way bigger than just the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant this is so what I think
actually what I have today in my lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: my team it's not the lab that doing
research on cannabis it's actually kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: method methodology how to work with this
complex plant how to do extract how to
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze active compound how to run them on
different diseases define the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: effect mechanism of action preclinical
clinical how to take something from is
[SPEAKER_00]: initial complex when we think we know that
is actually working on humans and taking
[SPEAKER_00]: all the route up to clinical trials so
this is the amazing team that work under
[SPEAKER_00]: my supervision they're doing the work when
I'm traveling in the world and they I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful for them and thank you for you
for listening
