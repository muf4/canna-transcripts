[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we, we touched on how people
acquire it, what the different stages are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We briefly touched about different
treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is that a rabbit hole that we can go
down?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would suggest when people get,
if people get Lyme disease and the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment isn't enough, then a great thing
to do is, um, there's a few resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is to look up, um, your local Lyme,
many, especially if you're in a major
[SPEAKER_00]: urban area or a largely populated state,
there's going to be Lyme disease support
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You contact them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, I'm really sick and my initial
treatment is not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for names of doctors who
specialize in treating Lyme because it
[SPEAKER_00]: really is a specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Lyme literate, um,
is a, is a term to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for a Lyme literate physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another organization called the
ILADS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called International Lyme and
Associated Disease Society.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they really have established a
protocol for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, uh, your Lyme literate
physicians get their training from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to their website and do a
search for doctors trained in your area,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and find somebody to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, these people will not be
accepting insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a good rule of thumb is to get a
good quality rule out if you're sick and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to know if you truly have Lyme
disease or not, you'd probably expect to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend somewhere around a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to find out if you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're talking about being a doctor,
$200 an hour for their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the testing is generally out of
pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the testing would be from those Lyme
literate physicians and not, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would, they would draw the last,
but there's, there's a few labs that
[SPEAKER_00]: really, because I told you the testing so
bad, the standardized test, there's labs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are fully accredited and good labs,
but they, they, they're not, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance coverage, uh, generally because
they do their own assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so they're, that's, uh,
but they do a good job and that's usually
[SPEAKER_00]: where these, um, doctors will send the
tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to imagine too, I mean,
at least from my own experience with,
[SPEAKER_01]: with finding the deer tick, it's tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think they describe it's like
the size of a sesame seed can be that
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I imagine that, you know, like perhaps
in your case too, where you have some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that summer flu or something,
or that, you know, that sickness that you
[SPEAKER_01]: just can't kick and you know, attributing
it to, oh, it's a virus or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it really could have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, sometimes people don't know they're a
bit, my dad almost died last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he was in the emergency room in and
out for, for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know what was wrong with them
and he kept getting fevers and his organs
[SPEAKER_00]: were failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I showed up and I said, have you
tested for ticks?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went, what do you do for a
living?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, never you mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they gave him antibiotics and he
bounced right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that didn't develop into some sort
of persistent condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, cause it was, it was, uh, it was,
that was a, that was a rare kind of case
[SPEAKER_00]: where it hit him hard and fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was anaplasmosis that was really,
um, tanking him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then that, and that happens sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's, he's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 80 and, uh, and yeah, sometimes
that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
