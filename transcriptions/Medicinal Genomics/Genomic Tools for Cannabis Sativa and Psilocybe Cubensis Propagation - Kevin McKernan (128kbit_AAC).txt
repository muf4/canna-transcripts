[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to spend some time talking about
at least the assemblies we have today and
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're going, which is, you know,
making these pan-genomes happen and
[SPEAKER_01]: peeling these things apart into diploid
genomes, as Seth's been saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then how we can apply these to other
medicinal organisms that are clearly on
[SPEAKER_01]: many people's radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slide point is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be talking about both
cannabis sativa and psilocybe cubensis
[SPEAKER_01]: today and some of the sequencing efforts
we've put forward to these.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bit of an outline here is we're looking
at these pan-genome approaches as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are also going to be mapping more of
these Illumina short sequencing reads to
[SPEAKER_01]: these pan-genomes, because you can get a
lot done with these things, even with
[SPEAKER_01]: short reads, once you have good
references.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, everyone prefers to have the
longer reads, but if you're short on
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars, the Illumina stuff can get you
many more for the same dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the genes that are well
mapped and understood, you can make sense
[SPEAKER_01]: of out of these shorter reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're also looking at ways to
further reduce the cost from whole genome
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing down to just targeted regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow the history of human
genomics, we went through this period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time where we were sequencing exomes,
and that was because it could bring the
[SPEAKER_01]: cost down to sequencing just the genes of
interest if you wanted to survey
[SPEAKER_01]: particular regions of the genome for even
lower costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you bring it one step further,
as Seth had shown as well, we've built SNP
[SPEAKER_01]: chips that people can use to survey 85,000
markers in the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you can deploy those at even
further numbers of plants at a reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ultimate like reduction of this
approach of surveying less and less is
[SPEAKER_01]: then make PCR markers that can survey a
single or five loci per assay point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we have, I'm going to go over some
of these strain seek panels that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: recently developed and recently put public
so that anybody can order these panels and
[SPEAKER_01]: use them at their university if they need
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this becomes a community design panel
that people can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're also going to look at some
pathways in response characteristics in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis plant, and then move over to
other fungi that are very much interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in this community, such as the Las B.
[SPEAKER_01]: cubensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so back before the pandemic,
which seems like yesterday, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We put out this Jamaican line reference
that Seth was speaking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was 1,000 times more contiguous than
the short read assemblies that existed
[SPEAKER_01]: before it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had to use a technology from PacBio
that isn't quite what they have today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's known as CLR technology, which was a
continuous long read technology that could
[SPEAKER_01]: do about 80 kb reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the noise rate in the reads
alone, they're probably around 90 to 95%
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a little bit more error
inside of those reads, which can
[SPEAKER_01]: complicate things when you're dealing with
a very polymorphic plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a result, we really hammered this
genome with 125x coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to do this anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hi-Fi technologies they have,
you can do this in like 30x coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll touch on one of these Hi-Fi
genomes we've done as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the N50s come out around three and a
half megabases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so out of reference, to the reference
that's currently in NCBI that Seth had
[SPEAKER_01]: hinted at being somewhat shuffled,
we've also seen that same problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The N50 numbers for that are around 750
kb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they piece together those contigs with
Oxford Nanopore, which doesn't do a very
[SPEAKER_01]: good job in repetitive regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets very, very long reads,
but it has very high error rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can get really confused in
polymorphic plants piecing together the
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosome numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chromosome numbers in NCBI have
frequently changed as a result of us
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to organize this picture as a
community over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the new references that are
coming out are helping to clarify this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll touch on one of them today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a great paper from Herb Bogan,
who went through all of the references
[SPEAKER_01]: that were available at the time of this
publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see some of them that are
really old were done only on Illumina and
[SPEAKER_01]: 454, some of those we put out in 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get better over time as we
graduate to these longer and longer read
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're looking at here is a
really important quality score that Seth
[SPEAKER_01]: had touched on, which is called a bus go
score.
[SPEAKER_01]: You scan these genomes for genes that you
anticipate every particular plant should
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we just have a catalog of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that all plants should have these
number of housekeeping genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're missing some of those
housekeeping genes, you probably don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a complete reference genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, these databases of bus go
genes are different for every type of
[SPEAKER_01]: genus you attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go into fungi, you've got to
change your bus go database.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're looking for is to have the
least amount of green on this slide,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are missing genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the part of the genome that you
failed to sequence because you couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: assemble it correctly or it's missing for
other biological reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The region that you see in gray is
actually what that's showing you is that
[SPEAKER_01]: the sequencers are starting to phase the
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that they're splitting apart
the maternal and the paternal haploid
[SPEAKER_01]: group into their own unique context
because the mother and the father genome
[SPEAKER_01]: were different enough from a sequencing
standpoint that the assemblers turn those
[SPEAKER_01]: into their own unique context.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the blue area are all the regions
that have been what Seth called a
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic haploid state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mother and the father genome were so
similar, we just called one haplotypic
[SPEAKER_01]: state, and we didn't need to split them
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is moving toward phasing these
genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very, very important in cannabis,
more so than it is in human, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you can see from those slides is
that the later the technology you used,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more complete the reference is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has nothing to do with the cultivar
that each of us chose or how smart we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just happens to be with how late we
decided to start sequencing these things
[SPEAKER_01]: and what part of Moore's law that we were
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did run something through Hi-Fi,
which what Seth talked about many years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, and this gave us N50s, which is the
average size of the contig.
[SPEAKER_01]: It inflated it out to over five megabases,
and the busco scores are getting up at
[SPEAKER_01]: 97%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's about as good as you can,
as close to finish as you can get without
[SPEAKER_01]: having to do a 20-year human genome
project finishing episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice the human genome project
recently closed and finished everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they did that really because of these
Hi-Fi sequencing tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: They threw some Hi-C and some BioNano in
there as well, but I think if you ask
[SPEAKER_01]: those researchers, what was the number one
thing that really changed and closed the
[SPEAKER_01]: human genome, they would tell you it's the
Hi-Fi sequencing chemistry that really
[SPEAKER_01]: made that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take these sequences we have
and align them to CS10, which is a type 3
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica Line's a type 2 plant,
and you can see there's not 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some crossover here between all of
the different homologies, and those
[SPEAKER_01]: differences at the time, we didn't really
understand where those true biological
[SPEAKER_01]: differences between the plants were with
these assembly artifacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're beginning to appreciate that
they may in fact be assembly artifacts as
[SPEAKER_01]: more and more other people polish these
same observations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that you can see with
Hi-Fi is you can see the length of
[SPEAKER_01]: telomeres now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is something that was really cool
because I have never seen 40 kb telomere
[SPEAKER_01]: sequences before in my life, and I've been
sequencing since 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: But out popped these telomeres with really
not a whole lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see they do vary based on
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're quite different in length.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are a couple kb, some are 40 kb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet this is a bit limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be some in there that are 60
kb, but we didn't really have the read
[SPEAKER_01]: length and Hi-Fi to be able to resolve
them at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is something to think about with
cannabis incidence and to think about with
[SPEAKER_01]: cloning age.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hyper clone things over time,
the telomeres likely shrink like they do
[SPEAKER_01]: in mammalian genomes, and this may give
you a sense of like a molecular clock in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we did some work with organ CBD
and urefins as well where we ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a lot of genotyping across an F1
population in Jamaican lion, and that
[SPEAKER_01]: helped us build these linkage maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can estimate that the actual
genetic distance between two different
[SPEAKER_01]: markers in a genome is a proxy for how
close they'll recombine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really the devil's in the biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to actually go and do the
crosses, and then you see how frequently
[SPEAKER_01]: these things actually recombine in biology
because the genes at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes have a tendency to cross over
more frequently than the ones in the
[SPEAKER_01]: centromeres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these linkage maps are important to
calibrate how likely is it that a gene
[SPEAKER_01]: will be co-inherited with another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just use a megabase scale on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to kind of convert it to
centimorgans, and this project helped us
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these categories and buckets that you
see in here in color are the concordance
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have with the Hi-C assembled
version of this genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is similar to the dovetail work that
Seth was demonstrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a chromatin capture technique that
buckets chromosomes into the proper place
[SPEAKER_01]: when you start with a collection of
hundreds to thousands of contacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a nice understanding of that,
thanks to some of that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few folks in Massachusetts that
have gone and tissue cultured this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, Jamaican lion can be tissue
cultured.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing weird about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've built snippet arrays off of this
reference, and we've also built some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these mini exome tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to, if better
references come out the next year,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're perfectly phased across 100
genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a boon to the industry,
and we'll readily adopt them because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a real challenging problem to work on
references that are dated in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we have taken then an approach
here of taking Illumina shotgun
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing, because it's more affordable,
to blast through another 40 genomes and
[SPEAKER_01]: map it to these references.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is in a preprint right now form
that's up in bio archive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you can gauge from here is the
type of variation that you see amongst all
[SPEAKER_01]: these genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, this is more variation than we
see in human genomes, and human genomes
[SPEAKER_01]: are much bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's about a variance every probably
50 bases between the hemp lines and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: every 90 bases between the type one lines
when you compare them to the Jamaican lion
[SPEAKER_01]: reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get into the Y chromosome,
this thing jumps to like a variant every
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Y chromosome is much more polymorphic,
and it's the largest chromosome out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's flowering genes on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a host of things in the Y
chromosome that we have to pay attention
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The indels are the insertions and
deletions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just be aware, the other axes up there
that you're looking at is the indel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, missed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're not gonna go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you about indels later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two different axes there,
one is snips and one is indels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's 10 to 15 million variants from
a single nucleotide level, and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of them from an insertion and
deletion standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get into structural
variations, the numbers go down from there
[SPEAKER_01]: substantially.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still a large portion of the
genome that is in structural variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most obvious thing in cannabis
genetics right now is what's known as the
[SPEAKER_01]: BTBD allele that Etienne de Meyer
originally described but didn't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic location of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been fully resolved now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd probably argue that maybe 90,
other than some of the exotic stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth has in his library, most of the
cannabis genetics out there, the THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD ratios are governed by this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna touch on some of the rare
things that they found as well that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: an exception to this rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically the presence of or absence
of CBD or THC synthase dictates the
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotype of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the exception that he mentioned from
Zirpel, which is that if you clone these
[SPEAKER_01]: genes into yeast, they make a portfolio of
cannabinoids even though they're supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to be dedicated to making one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD synthase makes like a 21 or 25 to
one ratio and can leak some THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to be careful about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have to be aware of the fact that
there are many other cannabinoid synthase
[SPEAKER_01]: genes in the genome and we don't know how
much those leak yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're presuming they probably leak and
they probably aren't specific to making a
[SPEAKER_01]: single cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably make predominantly one
cannabinoid by orders of magnitude but
[SPEAKER_01]: they probably leak other ones as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this heat map here is a list of the,
did I get that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that's backwards, that's
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I don't know how to make the laser
report to go on this but what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing on the right hand axis there are
the cannabinoid synthase genes and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing the presence of absence of those in
red and blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Jamaican lion references are over
on the right and you get this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: light blue color because they all have
those genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're seeing in the red and blue are
the disappearance of certain genes or the
[SPEAKER_01]: inclusion of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what Seth had mentioned, what we had
found a few years ago, is there is a very
[SPEAKER_01]: large deletion that covers the
cannabichromine synthase genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many of these genes in the
Jamaican lion reference but when the
[SPEAKER_01]: deletion occurs it takes out some
neighboring genes with it and these
[SPEAKER_01]: neighboring genes are known to be
associated with pathogen response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one approach to breeding perhaps low
THC plants, a really clever way is
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing in the varins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way is maybe breed plants that
have less of these other cannabinoid genes
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you don't risk the leakage from
these synthase genes leaking other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, potentially THC in your
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people are breeding to get rid of
the cannabichromine cassette and that if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's possible this can back you into a
corner and that it takes out some pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: response genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now down the lower area in yellow on this
map you can see that there's kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: scattering down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that's the part of the deletion
that isn't consistent plant to plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: some have variable lengths in this
deletion which means some deletions of CBC
[SPEAKER_01]: synthase can occur that don't knock out
these genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you gotta be careful when you go about
trying to knock these things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also extend this to pathogen
response genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right there's another list of
chitinases, thalmitin-like proteins,
[SPEAKER_01]: and an MLA.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that are published in
hops to have a big role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well we also had done some ISO sequencing
in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's RNA sequencing with PacBio.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that had demonstrated as the most
highly expressed gene in the genome were
[SPEAKER_01]: chitinases.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that dissolve fungal
coats and fight off pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we noticed in some work from Colorado
Seeds is they had a copy number
[SPEAKER_01]: amplification of some of these pathogen
response genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was a chitinase and one was a
thalmitin-like protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took those genes, we cloned them,
and we started running beta-gluconase
[SPEAKER_01]: assays to look for how effective were
these genes after we expressed them in E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they still work and would they
actually attack gluten?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we ran some assays that showed that
yes the cannabis cloned enzymes do in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: attack these glucans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started putting them down on
petri dishes on these tabs of paper to see
[SPEAKER_01]: if it would retard or change the growth of
various fungi that are known to affect
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see a penicillium species
there, a fusarium species there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can in fact put these enzymes down
and they slow the growth of these
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens that are known to affect
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this sounds like a great tool to spray
on plants, but you know the hydrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: peroxide is pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enzymes like this, even though they're
cloned in E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, are very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided there may be a better tool for
this that fit into our pipeline is can we
[SPEAKER_01]: use these in our pathogen detection tools
to actually do a better job of cracking
[SPEAKER_01]: open yeast and mold so that our tests
don't miss any of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an experiment we did where we
just put these enzymes after they were
[SPEAKER_01]: cloned out of the Jamaican Lion genome
into E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, expressed those enzymes,
put them into brass, and then spiked
[SPEAKER_01]: various different amounts of fungi in
there to see if these enzymes would
[SPEAKER_01]: actually liberate more of the DNA or
whether they would kill some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can in fact see a massive shift in
the quantitative PCR results when we have
[SPEAKER_01]: these enzymes present.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tells us that we're actually doing a
better job at retarding the growth of
[SPEAKER_01]: these particular fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was done actually with aspergillus
and we're getting a four to 64 fold
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction in the amount of aspergillus
that grows in a given time period when
[SPEAKER_01]: these enzymes are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these have now made their way into our
kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been in the field for a while now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our new PathoSeq products actually have
this enzymatic lysis involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least a derivative of this enzyme
involved, that helps crack open these
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast so we get a better job at actually
surveying the pathogens when we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to make safety tests for the pathogen
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yvonne's going to speak about this a bit
more tomorrow, but these kits have now
[SPEAKER_01]: made their way through AOAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least the aspergillus, four different
aspergillus species were through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just in the process of moving total
yeast and mold and total aerobic count
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of complexity to
actually doing this correctly,
[SPEAKER_01]: which she's going to touch on tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, there are genes in the cannabis
plant that have basically given us some
[SPEAKER_01]: wisdom on how to better survey the fungi
that might in fact infect it, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: quite cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what can we do from the
sequencing here?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to build a panel to focus
on sequencing certain genes, which are the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that probably matter the most to the
community?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put in the cannabinoid synthase
genes, we put in the terpene synthase
[SPEAKER_01]: genes, we put in the flavonoid genes,
the chitinase thalmatine-like proteins,
[SPEAKER_01]: the MLO genes, a lot of the other genes in
the genome that have been annotated as
[SPEAKER_01]: being pathogen resistance on Jamaican
Lyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also put in some flowering
genes from both the X and the Y,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of markers across the Y and some
random ones distributed across the genome
[SPEAKER_01]: so that the SNP chips and that the
sequencing tools that try to target these
[SPEAKER_01]: things for lower costs are actually
targeting some genes of really high
[SPEAKER_01]: interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is now a community design panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone can order it and use it at their
local university.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to necessarily sequence
with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just get the kit yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can use the software as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a public software service on
Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can import your samples here if you'd
like and it will analyze it according to
[SPEAKER_01]: the, this thing's even higher than 1605 as
of today, but these are all the genomes
[SPEAKER_01]: that are currently in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will give you an estimate of how rare
this genome is compared to everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in the database.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will also walk you through how much X
to Y sequencing we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be pertinent when we start
looking at hermaphroditic traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, there isn't a real clear signal
as to what genes drive this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've decided that we're just gonna
monitor how much the reads come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: these systems that match the X or the Y
and maybe some patterns will merge out of
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also go over those genes in
the BTBD allele that Etienne de Meyer
[SPEAKER_01]: described is that we wanna look at the
coverage of these genes and the presence
[SPEAKER_01]: of absence of these genes gives us a
really good predictive model as to whether
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna be a type 1, 2, 3,
4, or 5 plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can gauge that all from the sequencing
alone with some minor exceptions that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna touch on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that we frequently had
customers come to us saying, we sequenced
[SPEAKER_01]: with you and it's a CBG plant and you
called it a type 1 plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell's wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we dig into it and invariably we find
this variant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time this happened, like the
eighth or ninth time to us, I decided to
[SPEAKER_01]: write a white paper about it to explain to
everyone why this variant matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I put it up on the portal,
I noticed from Seth maybe a week later
[SPEAKER_01]: that they had already published about this
a month earlier in the pandemic and I
[SPEAKER_01]: missed the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also find that this variant is in
fact attenuating THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's amazing because it's a single
variant that seems to be driving this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've happened to find this variant is
always in concordance or in linkage with
[SPEAKER_01]: another variant known as P333R,
which itself doesn't seem to have any
[SPEAKER_01]: dysfunctional activity on the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a location in the genome that
Zirpel had tagged as being really critical
[SPEAKER_01]: to the glycosylation of this THC synthase
enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was very likely that the
damaging is because it's adding a
[SPEAKER_01]: glycosylation site to the THC synthase and
that's probably making it a dysfunctional
[SPEAKER_01]: version of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't have a copy of THC synthase
in rare cases that some of these type 4
[SPEAKER_01]: plants have and it's completely ablated by
having one of these polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So simple copy number analysis may miss
this and you need to get some simpsons
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the eight different strains that
kind of haunted us about this that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: sequenced over time that have this same
variant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the more interesting
ones is Doug's varins because Doug's varin
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually a THCV line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it did make some THC and it made it as
THCV but a little bit more in THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is it doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turned out it's actually
heterozygous for this variant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got one copy of THC synthase that
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got one that's broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the chemotype of this,
it also has half the amount of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid is actually CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bottleneck in synthesis here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When one of the genes is knocked out,
we can't convert all the CBG into THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get a buildup of CBG and we get a
little bit of THC and THCV as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I mentioned before, the platform
will give you some heredity information in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of what else these things are
related to, if it's common, if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: uncommon, it's rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: The SNP chips are now integrated as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you run SNP chips with Urofin,
we can port that data in and we can still
[SPEAKER_01]: call the copy number variants off of SNP
chips because there's enough variants in
[SPEAKER_01]: these genes that we just hyper tile those
genes and watch how many of the assays
[SPEAKER_01]: drop out and it can give us information
about whether it's CBD dominant,
[SPEAKER_01]: THC dominant, and whether it's male or
female as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bunch of different tools you
can use here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the best is obviously whole
genome sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The absolute pinnacle is what you're
seeing Seth do is doing Hi-Fi sequencing
[SPEAKER_01]: and building a reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more expensive and more time
intensive and you need very good high
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular weight DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't always get that out of a hole
punch from a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you can get a variety of these
things from like a hole punch of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A very small amount of DNA can be used for
these short read sequencers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there's varying degrees of
resolution here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's whole genome shotgun with
Illumina.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's doing this 18 megabase panel with
Illumina, it's 10 to 18 depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: deep you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an 85K SNP chip that you can
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Varying degrees of information that you
can pull off of this and they all
[SPEAKER_01]: integrate well with this canapedia tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what else can you do with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, once you have a really good
reference, you know what your pathogens
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very important when you're
looking for viruses because often time
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses just look like retroviral elements
in genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to have a really good
reference so that things that don't map to
[SPEAKER_01]: that reference, you can then go categorize
and say, okay, what do these things look
[SPEAKER_01]: like?
[SPEAKER_01]: This was actually done really elegantly by
the group at Phylos and Darcon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went and actually did RNA sequencing
and they were able to assemble those
[SPEAKER_01]: things and find new viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's very helpful to first
map all your reads against the references
[SPEAKER_01]: to pull off the things that are,
you know, that are related to the plant so
[SPEAKER_01]: you can play with the things that are
clearly not from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've gone and built lots of virus
tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a list of them up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have released these five ones so far
and the other ones are all made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we haven't released them is
we've not found molecular evidence for
[SPEAKER_01]: them yet in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than tobacco streak virus,
that was just published out of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it published and it was only 83%
identical to what was found on tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the lessons here is that even
though these things share names from other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, often times when you find the
virus in cannabis, it's so significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: diverged, it probably deserves a new name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's some of the problems we have is
in releasing these assays, we don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to release them until we actually see the
DNA sequence evidence of the virus that's
[SPEAKER_01]: on the plant so we know that our primers
actually hit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all these working on positive
controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not found evidence of them in
cannabis when you look at the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are on the pipeline side.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones on the left, we actually have
some evidence of them being in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll show you some examples of this
working really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we work with a few grows across the
country, some that were suffering from
[SPEAKER_01]: hoplite and viroids, some that were
suffering from lettuce chlorosis virus and
[SPEAKER_01]: one that was actually suffering from both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were quickly able to scan their
mother plants, identify the plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually had these viruses and viroids
call them and get their grows back to a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular place of productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This worked very well and very quickly for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we did learn a couple lessons in
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some other pictures of LCV that was
making a real mess of some of these grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: One lesson you learned is that the
phenotype isn't always evidence,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have one of these diseases,
it doesn't manifest in like a clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that's an obvious HLV and that's an
obvious LCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things sometimes have pleiotropic
conditions and they can, each one,
[SPEAKER_01]: each disease can look like one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the visual confirmation doesn't
necessarily tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that we noticed,
in this chart here, what you're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: in blue are hoplite and viroid assays that
were run across 12 different mother
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, heirloom mother plants from Colin
Palmer that were like 30 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not wanna get rid of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one trend you'll see is that when the
plants are actually infected with hoplite
[SPEAKER_01]: and viroid, they're screaming hot with CTs
in the 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not advise people to be culling
really important mother plants with very
[SPEAKER_01]: late CTs because those could be noise from
PCR, they could be contamination or they
[SPEAKER_01]: could be something very interesting
biologically that when you have something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's 100,000-fold lower viroid content,
you might be stumbling across a plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually has some form of resistance that
you wanna like put aside and maybe study a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't wanna have happen in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's aggressive use of PCR and people
start weeding out all their mother plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and suddenly the genetic diversity is just
imploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the CT values are really important
right now for us to monitor these and
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what we're looking at from a
viroid load level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing to do is to sample more
than once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, when we did this with Colin,
since these plants were some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: original like early chem-dog and sour D
lines is we said, all right, we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: PCR this thing in triplicate, we're gonna
do it every three days and we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: that for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're confident that we know this
mother plant is toast and there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do other than maybe go to a tissue
culture lab and sort it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're dealing with clones,
this is overkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe your clones are disposable,
just kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're dealing with a really
important heirloom mother plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd encourage you to put a lot of effort
into making sure this thing is in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: infected and it's not something that's a
fluke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what was interesting about the study
is we found this and then we surveyed the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots, the leaves, the pentails,
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The viroid is everywhere, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the roots and there's probably
some evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna gamble on this and say that I
think we're gonna find that these things
[SPEAKER_01]: are moving through the fungal mycelium
network because there is evidence of
[SPEAKER_01]: viroids moving, hop streak virus in
particular, moving in mycelium in other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might not just be about cleaning
scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got plants that are in the same
root beds, be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be a mechanism for these viroids
to actually communicate through the fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we are also putting in some tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a group here, EugenTech,
that has some of this running outside in
[SPEAKER_01]: the exhibit hall that's gonna help us with
auto-calling these PCR tools, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the labs that are running
Pathoseq are running lots of these samples
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a little bit cumbersome to have
people go through all of the CT scores and
[SPEAKER_01]: score them manually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an AI system that was really
honed over the coronavirus pandemic where
[SPEAKER_01]: they've gone through millions and millions
of samples and they can readily call these
[SPEAKER_01]: curves automatically and flag which ones
are truly failing, which ones have the
[SPEAKER_01]: internal controls functioning,
that's very important, and which ones need
[SPEAKER_01]: to be rerun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will help automate a lot of the
work that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a peek at it over in the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, where else can we apply this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, during the pandemic, I don't know if
people followed this, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting work on a compound known as
fluvoxamine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluvoxamine is an SSRI, but it's a very
interesting SSRI that has a sigma-1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor activity, somewhat unique in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: If any of you follow the DMT space,
you know that DMT also hits a sigma-1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor and it's also has a serotonin
mimimic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people think psilocybin can
replace some of these SSRIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that's been published in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got interested in sequencing this
thing because it also has been shown to
[SPEAKER_01]: play some interesting roles in treatment
resistance and depression and in cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: terminal cancer depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a wonderful presentation today out
about using this in breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we called up Seth and said,
hey, do you have any spare space in your
[SPEAKER_01]: pack bio?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the universities in COVID seem to
be shut down and they can't get us an
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate turnaround time in using the pack
bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sent him some high molecular weight
DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: He fit it in one of the holes in one of
his sequencers while he was doing hundreds
[SPEAKER_01]: of other cannabis genomes and out popped
this genome in remarkable shape after just
[SPEAKER_01]: being on a fraction of one of his flow
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was actually remarkable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hi-Fi sequencing on this had three of
the chromosomes come out tip to tip
[SPEAKER_01]: without needing to touch them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has never happened in my life in
genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always been an eyeball,
a human eyeball has had to take care of a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the repeat structures in any fungal
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's now in 13 chromosomes after we put
some of this Hi-C data on it from phased
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a really good annotated
reference now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been published.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in NCBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's open source for anyone to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're now beginning to tease apart the
completeness of the genome and some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathways that are in there and the one
pathway I want to turn your attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see the busco scores are up there
in the N50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all really important to
understand the completeness.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's, I think the best analogy here
is CBG and the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, CBG is the mother cannabinoid
and then it gets split apart by other
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fight over it, decide what to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a similar thing going on
in psilospy in that L-tryptophen is like
[SPEAKER_01]: the CBG analog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it either makes these tryptamines that
are psychoactive like psilocybin and
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocin, origination, beocysteine,
norbeocysteine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it makes these beta-carbolines,
which are monoamine oxidase inhibitors
[SPEAKER_01]: that can impact the actual metabolism of
the actual psychoactive compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the beta-carbolines are
psychoactive themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beta-carbolines are predominantly made
in the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the psilocybin is predominantly made
in the carpophores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this pathway was identified by many
people before us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frick et al and Bly et al had done a lot
of work on this looking at this cassette.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it turns out most of the genes
responsible for this in psilocybe cubensis
[SPEAKER_01]: are clustered in a 20 kb cassette that
some people even cloned into brewer's
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast to try and have beer that makes
psilocybin, which should be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you can do when you have sequence
like this, we now have 84 of these
[SPEAKER_01]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's another 16 coming off
machines right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you can do is look at those
pathway genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This here is the PSIM gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the gene that methylates the
tryptamine or the tryptophen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the map that you're looking at over
there is a SNP EFF map that looks at how
[SPEAKER_01]: damaging the mutation is and color codes
it according to how damaging it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The really bright green ones are
frameshift mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red ones are likely moderate mutations
that you should pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the green ones are amino acid
mutations, but they're not a really high
[SPEAKER_01]: EFF score.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anything that's blue is identical to
the reference sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see in here that the reference
genome that we picked, which
[SPEAKER_01]: embarrassingly is named penis envy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think the cannabis names are
bad, wait until you get into the mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll see that it has a difference in
this PSIM gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that's material to why it is
known to make a lot more psilocybin than
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the other mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's known to be one of the more potent
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now a nice phylogenetic tree of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we can readily take a
dissection into this and start looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: mating types.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know about X and Y mating types.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar to mammals.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get into fungi, things get much
more blurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now have these kind of spectrums of
genders that go on known as isomorphs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, we think this is tetrapolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's four different genders.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be six.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still trying to sort that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is just a picture of what some of
those mating types look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what are the mating types and what
govern them?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're governed by pheromones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And colonies on plates will not grow into
one another if they're wrong mating type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they won't form plant connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they won't share nuclei when this
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're now just trying to dissect
these mating types.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little short on time to dig into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a canapedia fork of this now
that does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks at coverage maps over the key
genes that are in the pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you how related you are to
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more importantly, you can dig into
each variant and pull up an IGV as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more importantly, it also digs into
the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to share a story with you this
last minute about why this became very
[SPEAKER_01]: important to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbiome of these things is
important in growing because you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: have bacteria around because it grows too
fast in these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fungi grow slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want very sterile growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have these genomes, you can build
PCR assays that do look for the
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is PSIM and PSIK being PCR-ed,
looking for total aerobic count or E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli background genomic information that
may be contaminating the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last few seconds, someone sent us DNA
from this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing grew in 16 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a monster mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The USA in Ecology had this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went sequencing about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that popped out are some
genes that are involved in making massive
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out psilocybe, in fact,
has this gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on a radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's very little diversity in it,
with the exception of what we're seeing up
[SPEAKER_01]: there in this monster mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This BM16 happens to have something weird
going on inside this gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we see multiple different copies of
this type of gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called FVCPC2.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't yet know if this is what is
driving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look through all the other
versions of this gene in psilocedia,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you find is that there are three
dominant forms of this gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 77 of the strains have one version
of the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five of the ones that are outside of
cubensis have a different version of the
[SPEAKER_01]: gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Xerisense PS in Orissa,
India, have a third version of this gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fourth version of this gene is
unique to BM16.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, we think, is too good to be
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That usually tells us we could have a
contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be part of the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we have to do some work to
resolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: These microbiome plots show us that when
we sequence this from spores, something
[SPEAKER_01]: else was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can notice that from these blob
tools plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing more sequencing on this now
to see if this is real or whether it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the lesson of this is genomics is a
very powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sort a lot of things out about
pathogen response, about yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how to target the various things that
may infect these organisms of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank all of these people
for helping us get to here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD is very noted up there because
SES Group's been very helpful on
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing a lot of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll leave it for, I have some time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't quite see out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not, I can see there's no one at
the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about all I can tell, other than
maybe Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need the, stick it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so our next speaker, we are saddened
to hear he's had some health issues and is
[SPEAKER_01]: staying home for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did, despite all of this,
put the time and effort into basically
[SPEAKER_01]: making this presentation available so that
we're going to have it on recording here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Zameer Punja.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has done a tremendous amount of work in
pathogens that infect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very pertinent to what we were
just discussing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's published many of the papers in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a real rock star in the field of the
pathogens that infect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to queue up Zameer Punja's
presentation next.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have one question before we do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin, you mentioned with things that have
the low viral count for hopslate and
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid that maybe people should consider
not culling and trying to keep those that
[SPEAKER_02]: might have that specifically really hard
to detect low viral count for hopslate and
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you recommend people safely
approach that being that the virus spreads
[SPEAKER_02]: so quickly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what to do about HLVD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did write an article about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd point people to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be very assay-dependent,
but for our assay, at least, we think
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that's over a CT of 33 retest,
particularly if it's a mother plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: you care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a clone, maybe it's not worth
retesting because the retesting may be
[SPEAKER_01]: more expensive than just making another
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's one of your heirloom plants,
everything under 33 we believe is
[SPEAKER_01]: something you probably want to pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're finding something that
consistently tests at 33, however,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's very interesting because
that's 100,000-fold lower viroid load.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we don't want to happen is that
in the course of frantically screening
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants, we rip out the plants that,
in fact, are able to manage this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the fact that low viroid load
is just a sign that the plant's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: clearing this and not going to be affected
by it from a yield standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this happens in human biology as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at coronaviruses,
a lot of people get reinfected with
[SPEAKER_01]: coronavirus after they're already immune
or vaccinated, and there's still a viroid
[SPEAKER_01]: load there, but they don't get sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So viruses, like the presence,
absence of them, I don't think is binaries
[SPEAKER_01]: who want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: When your immune system is clearing these
things, there will be low levels of this
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA that we can pick up for long periods
of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in coronavirus testing, when you're
positive, you're positive for 90 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're only infectious for nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't understand that biology with this
viroid yet, and so I'm just putting out a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of caution there until we
understand that biology, retest it if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a really important mother plant,
maybe destroy it if it's, in fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we have a sense of whether there's
an entourage effect working with
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin mushrooms similar to cannabis
where it's the interaction of not just
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin but other compounds that
affects how someone feels?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm jumping down because the sound
is better down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, is there an entourage effect,
I think is what you're saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: in psilocybin, and just like in the path
of moving from olivatolic acid to CBG onto
[SPEAKER_01]: more mature cannabinoids, the same thing
is going on in the psilocybin pathway
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're moving from L-tryptophen and
we're decorating that molecule with
[SPEAKER_01]: different methyl groups and
phosphorylating it along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get the spectrum of molecules like
origination, biocysteine, psilocin,
[SPEAKER_01]: and psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also norsilocin and norbiocysteine
that are different derivatives of these
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second entourage effect I think that's
in the mushroom that's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting is that there are compounds
like these beta-carbolines that we know
[SPEAKER_01]: are monoamine oxidase inhibitors that
change the way that your body metabolizes
[SPEAKER_01]: the former ones, and some of those are
even psychoactive themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is an entourage in these things,
and we don't really know which mushrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: are making these, and our effort here is
to try to tie the genotypes to those
[SPEAKER_01]: particular chemotypes over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to collaborate with people that
can do the chemotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we don't know a lot of people
that can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also hiring, so for folks out there,
this is part of the problem we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: solve, and we need more people for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
