[SPEAKER_02]: Our guest today is Dr. Deddy Meary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deddy is the associate professor at the
Technion Institute where he heads the
[SPEAKER_02]: Laboratory of Cancer Biology and
Cannabinoid Research.
[SPEAKER_02]: His lab investigates the vast therapeutic
potential of secondary metabolites from
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and other herbs, algae,
and psychedelic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And reveals how these naturally occurring
metabolites affect various types of
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer, inflammatory disease, and
disorders of the nervous system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deddy is also highly involved in
governmental regulations and is a residing
[SPEAKER_02]: member in several Israeli Ministry of
Health committees that seek to advance the
[SPEAKER_02]: fundamental understanding of optimal
cannabis and other psychedelic plants
[SPEAKER_02]: usage and curtailing adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: During our conversation, we discuss the
wide range of clinical applications for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis medicine, including cancer,
epilepsy, sleep disorders, Alzheimer's,
[SPEAKER_02]: and women's health issues like
endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: How cannabis's entourage effect challenges
the traditional one drug, one target
[SPEAKER_02]: model.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that many powerful cannabinoids
are often overlooked by standard lab
[SPEAKER_02]: testing methods, even though they exist in
significant quantities and show
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutic potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Israel's medical cannabis model,
which treats cannabis like a
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical with prescriptions,
clinical oversight, and growing physician
[SPEAKER_02]: acceptance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deddy's goal to provide evidence based
accurate treatments that tailor cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: therapies to specific health conditions
and individual needs and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation with
Deddy, I'd like to thank this episode
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, Trusted Cana Nurse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trusted Cana Nurse was founded by Megan
Bang and Ariane Williams, two nurses that
[SPEAKER_02]: are dedicated to bridging the gap between
traditional medicine and the world of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They specialize in creating evidence-based
treatment plans for all ages that address
[SPEAKER_02]: chronic illness, treatment resistant
conditions, mental health, autism,
[SPEAKER_02]: and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn more at trustedcananurse.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Dr. Deddy Meary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Deddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always great to talk with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're one of our favorite guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're one of our favorite CanMed
presenters, and we're thrilled to have you
[SPEAKER_02]: back for CanMed 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: The title of your presentation this year
is Cannabis as a Therapy Across Diverse
[SPEAKER_02]: Cancer Types, Milestones and Insights from
a Decade of Research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, congratulations on that
milestone, a decade of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me not young anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was young and promised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left with the promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll never be this young again,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all getting older.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all about your lab's work
investigating whether cannabis can serve
[SPEAKER_02]: as a primary pharmaceutical treatment for
cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we really dive into that,
I am interested in kind of exploring this
[SPEAKER_02]: past decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: How has perception of cannabis in medical
research evolved since you got started?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's an amazing journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started very skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis, like everybody that
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, people said that
cannabis is not addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to do a research with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn that it's very addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results that you get in working with
cannabis is something that a scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: usually don't see in the lab, in many
indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's quite a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would never dream to have such a
result, so phenomenal in so many
[SPEAKER_00]: illnesses, different, you know,
usually scientists and somebody to know
[SPEAKER_00]: everything about nothing, you know,
we're going very deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis caused my lab to be open and
to work in such a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indication, epilepsy, Alzheimer's,
sleep disorder and multiple sclerosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation, cancers, different types of
cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is touching so many systems in
our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time we discover something new,
very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's taking the lab or part of my
students to a new area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling so lucky that I choose to work
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I think we are helping a lot
of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, it's create my lab to be so
diverse and so interesting for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, you know, I'm grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it be difficult to focus, though,
if you have so many different indications
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're investigating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is the criticism that I'm getting
in the academia, and this is the criticism
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sometimes on myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be expert for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I'm expert for cannabis or the
endocannabinoid system, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm working with other plants
also, but I will never be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist in doing epilepsy or the best
science in doing multiple sclerosis or
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm usually collaborating with
experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm bringing the knowledge on the
cannabis, the endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, and collaborating with experts
in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, jumping on their back
and then riding with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's in personality issues,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy this diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did my postdoc and I won't work on
one protein in one for relation in one
[SPEAKER_00]: area, you know, I commit suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to look on the big picture to see
the big picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more interesting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was lucky to touch it because of
this diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is a penalty about how deep
you're going in each indication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a favorite, though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an indication that's top of the
list for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a sleep problem, but I think
it's sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my laboratory is lab for cancer
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, I think cannabis can be a
promise or can be a treatment to some
[SPEAKER_00]: types of cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's nice to find cannabis
that's helping in sleep and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're succeeding to eliminate
tumors and things like that, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: different level of science and feeling
about, you know, what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last three years, the lab is
working around women health and
[SPEAKER_00]: endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting for breast cancer,
but move for endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results there are phenomenal and
very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't want to say that women
are very interesting for me, but in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, I think the field, the hormone,
you know, all these systems in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: years are very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that seems to be an emerging topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we did have a presentation
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was last year about
endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have another one this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not a presentation, it's
definitely a poster presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, those those women health topics
are definitely gaining more traction.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least we're seeing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working a very different mechanism
that the endocaine, the regular endocaine
[SPEAKER_00]: and CB2 and CB1 and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as a scientist, it's
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's opened new gates to new,
you know, new windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I can talk now 10 hours on
the new indication findings that we found
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're calling the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is something that I'm putting a focus on
on it, but not as a classic what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: in the conference entourage effect,
but as a concept that what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: polypharmacology, that few compounds using
few compounds as or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of treatments in order to
attack a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is coming within like the
because the endocaine endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system is so wide and cannabis have so
many active compounds, it's bringing it
[SPEAKER_00]: within.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a concept for medicine in general,
but plant medicine in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm I'm fascinating and I'm,
you know, trying to hold the flag and wave
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To say that if we will understand the
complexity that plants bringing with them
[SPEAKER_00]: and treating with this complexity,
we might solve diseases that for hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of years we are hitting our head to the
wall like Alzheimer's, ALS, cancers,
[SPEAKER_00]: that single molecule like pharma that
trying to attack with single molecule is
[SPEAKER_00]: not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're coming with three or four
molecules that each one of them affect
[SPEAKER_00]: different system, different mechanism,
whatever, you might achieve something that
[SPEAKER_00]: is is bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is presenting that it's easy
to to show that with the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a it's a whole concept for herbal
medicine in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have a pitch that I'm saying
in the last three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you already heard that, I'm sorry
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people use plants as a medicine for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last 100 years, every time that we
succeed to isolate a molecule,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did kind of modification, whatever,
and it's become a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every time that it was more
complicated, it was few compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't succeed to isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stayed as a herbal medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a gap between accurate
medicine that we know exactly the molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: safety dosing and herbal medicine doesn't
matter if it's cannabis or other herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, you know, ginseng or whatever
you said, take you don't know what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: active compound, you don't know nosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it will help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the ability today with analytical
and computers to understand this
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this complexity can solve
diseases and problems that we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: succeed to solve this till today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use cannabis give me the tools to
understand that and to open, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in urine with herbal medicine,
cannabis is a perfect example for this
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is exciting me bigger than the
cannabis, bigger than the field is
[SPEAKER_00]: something called new concept in the
research and in medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that I'm showing with
the cannabis in the last years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm taking a disease like
inflammatory baldness, like chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: colitis and showing the few molecules from
the cannabis blocking the colon cells to
[SPEAKER_00]: call the immune cells and a few other
molecules affecting the immune cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: few other compounds affecting the third
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all together you get complex action,
the treating the, the, the, the chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: colitis better than one molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using the cannabis to prove kind of
a bigger concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the very long answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's interesting though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're basically saying that the whole
idea of single poly, single molecule,
[SPEAKER_02]: single indication is a bit of a fool's
errand or it's restrictive or that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of missing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working sometimes, but there is the
limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when I started to work with
cannabis few years ago, 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, it was already 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized there is many compounds
for, for many indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to one of the people, you know,
I mean, I'm, I'm a professor in the
[SPEAKER_00]: technical, it's kind of the MIT of,
of, you know, the U S it's the technology
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute and we have few genius there,
you know, that they, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: finish high school when they're being 11
and got a lab when they're 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: these kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to one of them and said,
Hey, look, I need your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are computer science, bioinformatics
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, there are 100 compounds and many
indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked at me and said, I will teach you
Excel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like this is not complex.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the complexity that we can
understand today with computer AI,
[SPEAKER_00]: bioinformatics, proteomics, metabolomics,
whatever, to understand how three
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a joke in the abilities that we
have today, but there regulation is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the physician, not the physician,
but maybe the regulation, take the FDA as
[SPEAKER_00]: an example is very still near,
you know, even though we can take a blood
[SPEAKER_00]: sample today, run it on equipment after 40
minutes, look on 5,000 different
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, we need to use just one because
that's what we used to.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's, we need to educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to lead that, and this is,
this is one of scientists, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: job to lead that, to, to show that present
that to explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we will see the future of
medicines are more complicated drugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: in plants in general, in particular,
in cannabis coming within it's in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This complexity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you started off talking about how
you're studying a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: indications with cannabis and how it's a
combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious when you're finding success
with treating the different indications,
[SPEAKER_02]: is there ever an example where it is a
single molecule or is it always a
[SPEAKER_02]: combination?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, there is, there is, there is
examples that we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a new cannabinoids like new
unknown cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it 3, 3, 1, 5, but it's a little
bit similar to CBG, but with three
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygens, the structure is a little bit
different, which these cannabinoids reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the estrogen expression, estrogen receptor
expression in the ovarian or breast or
[SPEAKER_00]: tube cells, which I'm not familiar with
any other drug that reduce estrogen in
[SPEAKER_00]: ovarian or tube cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be a treatment for
endometriosis and other diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a signal, single molecules,
but in most cases we found things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: more complicated in most cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So circling back to cancer, since that is
going to be the topic of your talk at Can
[SPEAKER_02]: Med 25 and sort of talking about clinical
applications or maybe, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: future research has any of your findings
led to any clinical trials or real world
[SPEAKER_02]: applications yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both, both questions are the answer is
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lead to clinical trials and lead to
real world applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in three cases, first of all,
I want to take one step back to explain
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is a given name to hundreds of
thousands of different chemovars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of them contain different
combination of molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just talk that this combination is
important for the effects.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer, it's a given name to thousands of
different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have in our body, 227 different types
of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each type of cell have different types of
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our, you know, lung cancer, breast cancer,
skin cancer, are totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even in one type of cancer,
breast cancer, we have 20 some different
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So altogether you're talking about
thousands of different chemovars of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and thousands of different
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now my goal in my lab or my,
what I'm trying is to match a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to a specific cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that cannabis can cure cancer
or cannabis can treat cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are specific types of cannabis or
molecules in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might help cure specific types of
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's first of all, let's bring it
back to earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's at least in three cases,
three types of cancers and mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know which cannabis,
which, which combination of molecules can
[SPEAKER_00]: kill these cancer when you have this
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in leukemia with a specific mutation
called notch one mutation, I already know
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the molecules in the cannabis
that will always kill the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a leukemia patient have a mutation
called notch one and 50% of the leukemia
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, it's not all the leukemia,
but it's around 60% actually.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these type of cancer will treat as a
chemo chemotherapy or radiation without
[SPEAKER_00]: all the side effects and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea, it would be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's killing the cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have three types of cancers like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are in two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened a company, raise money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started the process to go to clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other hand, we created the
products, cannabis product extracts or
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers that we aiming the specific
patient not to take a general cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: to take these cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually I'm very gentle on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying if you have leukemia and you
have this type of leukemia and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: already going to take cannabis and you
don't know what you're taking and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't care, why won't you take this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we have science on that and research
and we know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not coming to the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cure you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, if you're taking it arbitrarily,
and you don't know what you're taking,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just trial and error,
start with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I can think can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are following on the patient,
the taking, looking at the improvement and
[SPEAKER_00]: so and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are doing that.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's again, phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: A scientist usually like me, even when
you're finding something and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing findings in the lab until a
patient will touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 10, 15 years, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I did my postdoc in
Toronto, father of one of the PhD student
[SPEAKER_00]: that works with me and she's still a good
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a very important scientist in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was the one that invented the
Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he won, you know, all the prizes in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, he became a billionaire,
but this is different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came to give a talk in my
university a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he stand and he said, it's amazing how
we succeed to create a medicine in eight
[SPEAKER_00]: months to this virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now in my talk, I want to show you
that it took 40 years, that it took me 40
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm coming back to what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're meant to say usually to a
scientist in the lab to have a results and
[SPEAKER_00]: to affect the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he is lucky and if he's, you know,
amazing and then got a Nobel prize,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's 15, 20 years in my field,
in my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we finding something in two
weeks after it's can already be in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can already recommend the patient or
help a patient with that because the
[SPEAKER_00]: product is on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to point him to what we found
and think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very unique situation,
very unique feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very, very careful or, you know,
I don't know how to say that very,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying things that I'm not 100%
sure about them when I'm not 100% sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that it will help and not do a damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you know something and you help,
it's really a good feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a unique situation that patients
kind of have access to this medicine early
[SPEAKER_02]: on where that's not typically the case
with other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an access to the medicine before
you prove it's really medicine.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the access before they have the
knowledge, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you talked about cannabinoids,
you talked about rare cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: one that you mentioned that was just
numbers and instead of letters,
[SPEAKER_02]: the alphabet soup that we typically deal
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is that a common finding that these
rare cannabinoids in the low
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations are offering more promise
perhaps than the ones we know and love
[SPEAKER_02]: like THC, CBD, CBG?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say the 50% in the cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's CBG, CBC, CBDV,
the more known ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in half of the cases is the rare
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to say something, okay,
which is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't see it and never heard about
it doesn't mean that it's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean that it's low concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the molecule that we saw that killing
the leukemia, it's unknown cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a new one, whatever, but it's the
third more expressed in these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was 2.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not low percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the regular equipment or the HPLC and
we don't have standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't see it usually doesn't mean
that it's rare or very low concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually these are not, you know,
a very extremely low concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not 0.001%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% but it's an
unknown molecule.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, so it's sort of a limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for cutting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look on other plants, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even, you know, today people talk about a
lot of mushroom, functional mushroom or
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look on the concentration of the
molecule there, which consider active,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will be 0.2%, 0.5%, 0.1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, when you say 0.3%,
you think it's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or minor, but if you translate,
if a patient using one gram, just for,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will be easy to calculate, you know,
the average amount of a patient in Israel,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's 32.5 gram a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an average of one gram.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, if a molecule is expressing 0.5% in
this, in this flower, it will be 50
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 milligram is drivable.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 milligram, it's, it's, it's not low
amount for a drug or a molecule to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really a rare or minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are wrong to call them like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying with the testing labs or
the equipment or sort of the methods that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're using, there could be these
unknown cannabis cannabinoids that are
[SPEAKER_02]: there in concentrations, but they're just
not seeing it with the equipment or not
[SPEAKER_02]: reporting it on the, on the COA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying maybe we know that like
after 10 years, I can tell you exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the cannabinoids, which express
in quite high amount, you don't see or you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the laboratories have the ability
to do that, but because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to anybody and it costs more
money, it will cost instead of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, $50 or 40, $40 for the test,
it will cost $300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they will not ask for these
readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually the laboratory is not
developed method to look on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every good laboratory in the U S that have
mass spec or GCMS can take my paper
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no economic demand for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's, that's the reason it's a
mistake in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's how I work, but for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we bring all these different
people together for CanMed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we bring the researchers,
the doctors, the testing labs,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: All together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so that this is why I love CanMed
so much, you know, it's very scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: from one hand, but very, the variety of
people, you covered so many areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from cultivation, analytics,
the medical, even the recreational,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that coming together from very good
scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Researchers, physicians, you know,
activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's an amazing venue to,
to learn and to show the new data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so winding down here, Daddy,
we, we opened by talking about your last
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 years in cannabis research and where
we've come, where do you see cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: based cancer therapies in the next 10
years?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I will divide the two countries
that have medical cannabis, mainly two
[SPEAKER_00]: countries that it's legalization and
something like that, because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: different point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Israel, cannabis, it's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a medicine been being prescribed by a
physician under healthcare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get it in pharmacy, like every
other drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually one of the most prescribed
medicines in Israel, but it's a totally
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and we succeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying we, because, you know,
I'm the advisor for the minister of health
[SPEAKER_00]: for psychedelic plants and by that
cannabis, and I'm part of the regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm, you know, I'm, I'm feeling part
of the, the movement in Israel that doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that, we succeed to bring it to the
mainstream of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A physician eight years ago, nine years
ago, when I started said on my,
[SPEAKER_00]: on my dead body that somebody will
prescribe cannabis in my department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today there is no physician that not
prescribing cannabis become common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, second, we succeed to bring
the cannabis or to try to take it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: To bring cannabis, which is evidence-based
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are doing branding now with the
biggest pharma company in Israel and with
[SPEAKER_00]: the healthcare in Israel and branding said
evidence-based and the meaning we said
[SPEAKER_00]: every cannabis strain then being tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's good for that
indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we, we did a clinical trials on
patient, not FDA approved clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: but test it on a real patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's evidence-based and now a physician
can prescribe it like a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can prescribe when he knows what are
the active molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know the mechanism, what is the
drug, drug interaction with other drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then dosing the side effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can, he can treat it as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to understand a physician that
come to prescribe a physician study in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel, seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have another five years of
kind of a, you know, before it become
[SPEAKER_00]: tenure and whatever, like 12, 15 years is
studying and now you ask him to prescribe
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To prescribe something that he has no clue
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I study 15 years, you know,
if I know nothing, but if you give him the
[SPEAKER_00]: tools said, okay, this product,
this is the mechanism of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the side effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be careful then on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he become a physician and giving
these tools, bring cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment to the next level that I believe
that is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see how it's open gates,
how it's open mind of the physician,
[SPEAKER_00]: the relation, the healthcare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring it to something more accurate,
more professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most important, you help the patient
to get better treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we started treating cannabis in
a trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with sentences or a phrasing
like start slow, you know, start low,
[SPEAKER_00]: go slow, you know, and think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a migraine and you're taking a
pill and you have 20 pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the physician said, every time that
you have a migrant, start low,
[SPEAKER_00]: go slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, the dosing, you're talking
that the migrant is off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is accurate treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, a patient known his body,
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sentence like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meaning is we don't know how to
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the meaning of, you know,
trial and error and bringing to more
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate will reduce, you know,
these trial and error, increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: success rate and having a better treatment
to patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I think the next generation,
the next three, five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In medical cannabis, make it a specific
treatment, accurate treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: not anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, try 10 strains and then decide which
one is helping you to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to take, go to this strain,
this is go to sleep because it's good to
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep because of these molecules,
these combinations, this complexity,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we will know to direct the patient
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I would imagine in order for
that to work, there needs to be accuracy
[SPEAKER_02]: in the testing and consistency in the
product, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: The product is very consistent in the
last, I would say five, six years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when we started to work 12,
10 years ago, cannabis grow outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a difference between
summer and winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can say white widow, but then you
test them genetic and 10 of them were
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that anymore, not least in
Israel and in the areas that I'm working,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing mostly indoors in very
controlled way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level of growth and the product is,
you can compare it to what was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's consistent and accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's easier to do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if we want to treat it as a
medicine, you want it to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Daddy, I do want to be mindful
of your time, but before I let you go,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give you a chance to share with
the listeners or the viewers any way that
[SPEAKER_02]: they can read up more on you and the work
that you're doing or possibly connect with
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please plug any links.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to put them in the show
description so people can read more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm publishing my papers and then there is
a, you know, all the papers is out on
[SPEAKER_00]: PubMed, but there is Google Scholar and
LinkedIn and all of these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to reach me and to read about my
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are previous talk in CanMed and
other, you know, other conferences and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I don't like people to show that
because I'm repeating my jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to work out some new material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: People should check out those links and
join us in Puerto Rico for CanMed 25 and
[SPEAKER_02]: meet Daddy in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having me here and
in Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always learning a lot and meeting a
lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you and all the people
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
