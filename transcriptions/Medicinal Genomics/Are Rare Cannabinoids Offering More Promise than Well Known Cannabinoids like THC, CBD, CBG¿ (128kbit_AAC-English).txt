[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that a common finding that these
rare cannabinoids in the low
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations are offering more promise
perhaps than the ones we know and love
[SPEAKER_00]: like THC, CBD, CBG?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will say the 50% in the cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's CBG, CBC, CBDV,
the more known ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in half of the cases, it's the rare
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to say something, okay,
which is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't see it and never heard about
it, doesn't mean that it's rare,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mean that it's low concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the molecule that we saw that killing
the leukemia, it's unknown cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a new one, whatever, but it's the
third more expressed in these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was 2.3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really minor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not low percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the regular equipment or the HPLC,
and we don't have standards, so we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: see it, usually doesn't mean that it's
rare or very low concentration,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually these are not, you know,
a very extremely low concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not 0.001%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, but it's an
unknown molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of a limitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for cutting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at other plants, okay,
even, you know, today people talk about a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of mushroom, functional mushroom,
obsolescent mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the concentration of the
molecule there, which consider active,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be 0.2%, 0.5%, 0.1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, when you say 0.3%,
you think it's rare or minor, but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: translate, if a patient using one gram,
just for, it will be easy to calculate,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the average amount of a patient
in Israel, it's 32.5 gram a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an average of one gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a molecule is expressing 0.5% in
this flower, it will be 50 milligram a
[SPEAKER_01]: day, 50 milligram is drivable.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 milligram, it's not low amount for a
drug or a molecule to affect your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really a rare or minor,
we are wrong to call them like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying with the testing labs or
the equipment or sort of the methods that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using, there could be these
unknown cannabinoids that are there in
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, but they're just not
seeing it with the equipment or not
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting it on the COA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying maybe we know that,
like after 10 years I can tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the cannabinoids which express in
quite high amount, you don't see or you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the laboratories have the ability
to do that, but because it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to anybody and it costs more
money, it will cost instead of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, $50 or $40 for the test,
it will cost $300.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually they were not asked for these
readings and usually the laboratory is not
[SPEAKER_01]: developed method to look on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every good laboratory in the US that have
mass spec or GCMS can take my paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: read it, and in one day be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no economic demand for them and
that's the reason.
So, thank you very much.
