[SPEAKER_00]: What is your process for adding new
products like new cannabinoids into your
[SPEAKER_00]: portfolio?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we get a big pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the wish list is big.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have prototypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, things that I find
interesting based on preclinical
[SPEAKER_01]: literature, based on what people are
telling me, we usually make a prototype
[SPEAKER_01]: and share it around with the staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with myself and some of our colleagues
and see what people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a good example of this is our,
I think it's our newest product still.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a combination of CBDA and CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBGA, like who knows anything about
CBGA?
[SPEAKER_01]: You look in the peer review literature,
there's so little on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a few more hits just this past
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it similar to CBG?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which we also don't know that much about,
but we know more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it different than CBG?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of unknowns there,
but there was this, you know, preclinical
[SPEAKER_01]: study that gained a lot of headlines about
how it could inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus
[SPEAKER_01]: and its infectious potential in mice and
in cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we thought, well, you know,
we've seen such impressive results with
[SPEAKER_01]: the acidic cannabinoids, the THCA and the
CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of makes sense for us to explore
CBGA next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started playing around with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that in combination with
CBDA, it seemed to be doing something
[SPEAKER_01]: special.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we weren't testing it against
SARS, you know, like against COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just taking it and see how we
felt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were reporting very similar
things that this combination made them
[SPEAKER_01]: feel alert, awake, focused, like in the
zone, resilient to stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't expect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't exactly know what's the
mechanism of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: But enough of us felt like, well,
this is a prototype worth bringing to
[SPEAKER_01]: market that, you know, that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still have so much to learn from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even CBG, I knew it had a lot of
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we know about it in humans right
now, other than the anecdotes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost nothing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one survey study and the people in
that study weren't, you know, the data is
[SPEAKER_01]: just not very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a good starting point,
but we don't know exactly how much most of
[SPEAKER_01]: them were taking or what other
cannabinoids they were taking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, we currently have
an ongoing another survey of CBG users to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to clarify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like you get something that's
a hit in a small number of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You allow other kind of cannabis
enthusiasts to start using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then before too long, we've got some
signals that are worth following.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we do the observational research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of confirm what we think we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, maybe that leads to
more clinical trials or more animal
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it's so backwards with
cannabis that we start with humans and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we go to them, at least after that.
