[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've established the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were a grower and you suspect
that you have an infected plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are your options?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's many things growers can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the first thing they need to do
for sure is confirm that they've got hop
[SPEAKER_01]: latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever plant they're dealing with,
most likely it's a flowering plant because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's usually when you see it and they
send it out for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing would be to work
backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And try to figure out where did I get my
clones from for that particular plant or
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular genotype?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I grow it indoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I purchase it from someone else or did
I start it from seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you sort of work backwards,
you can say to yourself, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's assume it came from clones within
your own facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the mother plant definitely has
hop latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you work backwards, you then test your
mother plants depending on how big they
[SPEAKER_01]: are and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk about sampling strategies,
but you test your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, if the mother plant is
infected, the bad news is that I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got to be thrown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no proven ways right now to
rescue a plant that has hop latent in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've talked about Marystem
culture and tissue culture and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible, but it hasn't been
demonstrated on a high level, on a high
[SPEAKER_01]: scale that you can rescue a mother plant
that's got hop latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've proven that it's your mother
plant, then obviously you get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other possibility is that it picked it
up when the plant was in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you're vegging on a table and
if you're using hydroponics, then you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got water or nutrient solution moving
between plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've shown and others have shown that it
can move with water, with recirculating
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a veg plant that's maybe two weeks
old could potentially have picked up hop
[SPEAKER_01]: latent through the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the viral then makes its way into the
plant that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, the last alternative
is a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you started from seed, you didn't test
the plant that came out the seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could be that gave rise to your
infected flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a detective process of elimination
deciding where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know that that's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you kind of answered my next
question, but I think it's a good,
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing to hammer home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really doesn't seem to be any sort
of treatment or kind of remediation
[SPEAKER_00]: options available yet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a heavily, heavily infected
or even an infected mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, people have tried and
people are trying taking cuttings from
[SPEAKER_01]: different parts of the big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could, you could definitely do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take them from the top,
the actively growing, you could take it
[SPEAKER_01]: from the side to bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you have to go through and test
all of those to see if by chance,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really it is chance, if by chance you
were able to get a clone that was free of
[SPEAKER_01]: hop latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when the viral gets in,
and we can discuss this now, the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place it goes is down into the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say, let's say I infected it
through cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went with my tools and I transferred
some sap onto a cut surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first place it goes is down into
the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that takes about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say two weeks after it was
introduced, it goes down into the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from the roots, it's moved
upward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason it's moved upward is it,
it sort of follows the flow of sugar,
[SPEAKER_01]: star sugars that are being produced by
photosynthesis in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that usually is towards the actively
growing shoots, which are the young
[SPEAKER_01]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll find it in the young shoots,
probably around four weeks after that
[SPEAKER_01]: initial infection occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it starts moving around the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say by six weeks, it's now pretty
much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are cases where, you know,
a branch gets missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a disease plant and all of a
sudden, you know, a healthy branch on one
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I have a photo in that
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can come back to it in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason that branch got missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're lucky enough, you can get a
cutting out of that, a clone out of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you may have escaped hop latent,
at least in that particular plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a uniform distribution
throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some producers will go through and
take clones from various parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plant in the hopes that they can
find a few that don't have the violin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good way to do it.
Thanks
for watching!
