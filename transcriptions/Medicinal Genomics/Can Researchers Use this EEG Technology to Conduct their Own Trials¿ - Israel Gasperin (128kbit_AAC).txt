[SPEAKER_00]: So researchers, they could develop their
own trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is exactly right, Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We created some, let me call it,
standardized master EEG research protocol
[SPEAKER_01]: that has been approved by Health Canada
and has been approved multiple times by
[SPEAKER_01]: different independent ethnic research
boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beauty of our standardized
research protocol is that it enables our
[SPEAKER_01]: partners, because we don't only do
research in our lab, we are implementing
[SPEAKER_01]: this technology in other labs and research
hospitals, in that they can customize this
[SPEAKER_01]: protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, what we do is EEG recordings
before the intervention or consumption of
[SPEAKER_01]: a product, and then after the consumption
of the product, so the after consumption
[SPEAKER_01]: recordings are completely customizable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do many EEG scans or recordings
right at the beginning, the first 30
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes, if your objective is to capture
the onset time as accurately as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that as resolution,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The more samples, the higher the
resolution to see how that evolves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, you can do it, you can just
record the EEG of a study sample of
[SPEAKER_01]: objects and map that product experience
for up to 30 minutes, or 45 minutes,
[SPEAKER_01]: or one hour, or three hours, or up to five
hours, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can customize that according to the
needs and objectives of the company or
[SPEAKER_01]: research organization that is conducting
the research in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I have to imagine this being AI
and machine learning, the more data that
[SPEAKER_00]: folks are generating, it's just going to
feed into the system and just improve it,
[SPEAKER_00]: correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a snowball, because the more
data we collect, the more AI will continue
[SPEAKER_01]: learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we will get to a point where
the PEL metric will not only measure the
[SPEAKER_01]: high and how strong is that effect,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will also tell us what type of high you
are experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you experiencing the body high,
or the head high, or hallucinations,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it will get to that level of
accuracy, and even better, I think that it
[SPEAKER_01]: will get to a point where we will be able
to personalize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine that at a certain point,
and I want to be one of the first ones to
[SPEAKER_01]: say it, because I really think it will
happen, is that these devices will become
[SPEAKER_01]: gadgets for consumers, where you will be
able to wear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will read your brainwaves and will know
who you are, what type of brain you are,
[SPEAKER_01]: and based on that, you will tell this app,
hey, I want to relax today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you are this type of brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the type of products that you
should consume, and this is how you should
[SPEAKER_01]: consume them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that would be one of the
latest stages of adoption of wearable
[SPEAKER_01]: technology and AI for these types of
consumer packaged goods markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: like personalized recommendations of
products used to accomplish an experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can definitely see a future with
that.
I
think that it will get to that level of
accuracy.
