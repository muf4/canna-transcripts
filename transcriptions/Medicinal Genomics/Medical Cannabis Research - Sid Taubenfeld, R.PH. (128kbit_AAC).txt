[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Tikon Olam Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Sid Taubenfeld, and I'd like to
go through a couple of things about Tikon
[SPEAKER_00]: Olam.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, how I got involved in Tikon Olam,
and secondly, what Tikon Olam is up to
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our studies, which I think will
have important implications for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community, and basically what
other research we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working as a hedge fund analyst,
portfolio manager, and someone called me
[SPEAKER_00]: up and said, you know, are you interested
in doing a cannabis company and running a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis company?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you smoke pot, you see,
you feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to do to really show any
benefit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, well, you've got to go to
Israel and speak to Dr. Mishalem,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruth Kalili, and Timna Naftali.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went, and this is what she showed
me in one of her ulcerative colitis
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: After eight weeks of cannabis treatment,
and you don't have to be a big radiologist
[SPEAKER_00]: to sort of see this, that one of the
patients had a clean colon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, that's interesting, but not all
the patients had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what else do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she showed me one of the Crohn
studies she did, and she had an 85.7%
[SPEAKER_00]: significant improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was just 30 patients,
but these 30 patients, as Dr. Dorr said,
[SPEAKER_00]: went through the standard of care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after using the cannabis, 85.7% felt a
significant improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something, you know,
that doesn't, I mean, you don't see those
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of numbers every day, and they're
not coincidental.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final thing that kind of got me
interested was the corticosteroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we had 30 patients, and 26 of them
were taking corticosteroids, and after the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis treatment, only four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that may be like something you're not
interested in, or a nice number,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you look at the side effects of
oral corticosteroids used long-term,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you have vulnerability to
infection, diabetes, hypertension,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that we could get the patients
off oral corticosteroids in the long-term,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think was, and that kind of sealed it,
that there's something going on here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's something worth pursuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The history of ticonolam, so I decided
obviously to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The history of ticonolam was in 2002,
it was started as a non-profit company,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically for Holocaust survivors and
veterans, for more for PTSD, 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they got a license, the first
license from the government of Israel,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in 2012, they started producing
cannabis for medical use and dispensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even today, one out of every three
patients get their cannabis from ticonolam
[SPEAKER_00]: in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the U.S., it's a whole different
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Dr. Mishulam isolated and
discovered THC in 1964, and it took until
[SPEAKER_00]: 1981 to get a drug on the market with had
some cannabis usage, and then four years
[SPEAKER_00]: later, Maranol, Durabinol, and Sesamet are
the two drugs that are on the market for
[SPEAKER_00]: use in nausea and vomiting, CINV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, before I started doing
this, I was thinking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an analyst, and you have two drugs on
the market, and everybody's saying this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a billion dollar industry, yet these two
drugs haven't really done that well,
[SPEAKER_00]: or really haven't been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with further research, I realized that
these are synthetic THCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably less than 10% absorbed with
Maranol, and actually the market is a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger once we get to the botanical
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010, you had Sativex by GW, which is only
approved in Europe for spasticity due to
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 50-50 product, 50 THC, 50 CBD,
and before we heard explanation why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not in the U.S., but I know they're
working on for pain, and probably they
[SPEAKER_00]: will be filing at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier this year, a liquid form of
Maranol was approved, and it was approved
[SPEAKER_00]: at schedule two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other Maranol at schedule three,
and you're trying to figure out why is
[SPEAKER_00]: this being approved at schedule two more
severe?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is that they do likability
studies, and apparently they were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse this more like dumping cigarettes
in, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and basically, that's the approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we get to Epidiolex,
which is a major victory for this industry
[SPEAKER_00]: as having a botanical product approved by
the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bigger improvement is that at
schedule five, which is the least severe
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the different schedules,
and schedule five means you could use it
[SPEAKER_00]: off-label, and you could probably get
insurance reimbursement that remains to be
[SPEAKER_00]: seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a quick chart of the DEA
scheduling of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, just like I spoke before,
cannabis, the THC is still schedule one,
[SPEAKER_00]: with heroin, LSD, and MD, and MD.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Tikon Olam, since we launched the
medical dispensary, we decided to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the patients and give them
questionnaires to figure out what these
[SPEAKER_00]: patients are taking, what diseases they're
taking them for, and how it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a database of close to 20,000
patients now, and obviously growing every
[SPEAKER_00]: day as we dispense more cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look, 94% of the patients saw
improvement in their condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 62 reduced medications, which I'll
come to a little bit later, which I think
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of the most important things of
cannabis, is that we can reduce toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study we released early in the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a prospective study on cancer
patients, their usage and efficacy of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with Lehi Bar-Lev, who's Schindler,
who's our medical director in Israel,
[SPEAKER_00]: Victor Novak, who's our clinical director,
and if you need a paper, Dr. Mishulam has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be on the paper, so we have all the
guys on this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the indications that we found
for use in medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% of the patients are for cancer
symptoms, 24 pain, and as we move down,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see other diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We screened 3,845 patients, and 2,923
responded to the questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The severity of this is in six months,
a quarter of the patients died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're working on is probably close
to 2,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the malignancies they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most had breast cancer, lung cancer,
pancreatic, all the cancers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: typically found, but the majority were
breast and lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symptoms, it's an eight on the pain
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight out of 10, it's a very severe amount
of pain that these patients had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had sleep problems, they had
digestive problems, all the anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: depression, nausea and vomiting,
of course, all the typical symptoms that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would see with cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see the global assessment after
six months, it's pretty amazing that 50.8%
[SPEAKER_00]: felt they had a significant improvement,
34 and 10 in terms of slight and moderate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a 95.5% improvement in patients,
however they felt it was, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very important that that's a big number,
and I think we should really keep that in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going forward, the quality of life before
and after, you can see as things moved
[SPEAKER_00]: along, after six months, we had 611 felt
their probability of life was good,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 199 very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've been around cancer patients,
these are very significant numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the symptoms and the change
after six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see the sleep problems,
16% disappeared, and improvement was 70.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think sleep has a lot to do with getting
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if people are sleeping better,
they have a much better chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see anxiety and depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, like 75%, felt
improvement, digestive problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nausea and vomiting, of course,
which is the old and the tried and true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the adverse event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 8% has some dizziness, dry mouth,
increased appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of consistent with what we'd
expect with cannabis, and in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: treating cancer, pain, it's probably
better than any drug that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I think, if you wanted the
important slide in my presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could take away, because this
is what I think will lead for us to do
[SPEAKER_00]: more studies, and other people out there
doing more studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the first line,
you have people who stopped taking
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 36%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking about a pain of eight,
which is very significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: 36% stopped taking their opioids,
and 9.9% decreased their dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's about 50% of
people and patients were off the opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have to tell you what's going
on today with opioids in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction, and I'll come back to it a
little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think this in itself propels us to
start doing some studies in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: replacing opioids with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at Enzyalytics, sort of like
the Valiums of the world, 23.8% stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: taking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corticosteroids, 31%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stopped taking corticosteroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, antibiotics and nausea,
67.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are, and laxatives, because
obviously people stop taking opioids,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't need the laxatives because
opioids can cause tremendous issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what we should be concentrating
is on the opioids and how these patients
[SPEAKER_00]: can stop taking the opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you'll be hearing from us in
the near future in terms of doing studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick discussion of the study,
just so you don't think everything was
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the treatment was effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to use the heterogeneous population
from a few months to 99 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18.8 patients discontinued treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people, cannabis didn't have any
help, and the other issue was
[SPEAKER_00]: self-reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we need to do, obviously,
is to establish a national and
[SPEAKER_00]: international clinical investment program,
investigational program, to prove these
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, the CDC statistics,
115 Americans die every day from opioid
[SPEAKER_00]: overdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% of the patients involve prescription
opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a financial burden on the
country, $78.5 billion a year is cost
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the people abusing opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Tikalam, we're going to go further and
do many more studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the studies that are scheduled
to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Crohn study, as Dr. Dorr mentioned,
we just released some data in Europe on
[SPEAKER_00]: Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do the other data in terms
of colonoscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have decrease in colonoscopy in
patients taking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had a little bit of decrease in
placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have to work our way
through that in terms to understand why
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect if we take it longer,
to six months, we probably will see a
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation between the Crohn's
patients and the placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing an acute migraine headache
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing agitation and Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're more than halfway through that
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results are looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to start an autism study very
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tourette syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing an orphan drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most important, we have two
prospective study papers coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably before the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is in autism in 188 patients where
these patients were taking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the data will be good,
otherwise I wouldn't be mentioning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you guys should keep an eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most patients that have ever been
reported upon in autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will be doing a fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a fibromyalgia paper with 367
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's in the near term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be very helpful to kind
of keep an eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of us are in trying to do
studies and increase the clinical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the only way things will
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if we increase the clinical data,
mainstream physicians will start using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think ultimately the political people
will pick up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that will be the beginning of
a turnaround for the use of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: sick patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for that presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to the opiate reduction use,
I saw a column that said new medications.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the new medications that they
took after reducing their opiate use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically it was simply they stayed on
opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no new medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new medication may have been the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these patients were taking cannabis
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they stopped their opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no other medications at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is, in The Scientist,
Dr. Mechelam talks about the possibility
[SPEAKER_06]: of cannabis for type 1 diabetes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was wondering if that's on your list
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some animal data out of
Hadassah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They showed it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're ready for that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure down the road either we'll be
doing it, someone else will be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have what I've seen as to be very
good animal data.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you speak to any randomized control
trials being done with Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_05]: disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some preliminary studies in
Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found it to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not right now doing any kind of
large scale studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know there are other companies doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would make sense that Parkinson
would be, since it's a neurological
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, it would make sense that at some
point someone would be doing some studies
[SPEAKER_00]: on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any studies being done comparing
delivery methods of cannabinoids for
[SPEAKER_03]: things like Crohn's disease, such as
inhaling it versus putting it in the gut,
[SPEAKER_03]: either in a capsule or suppository?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're thinking of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure others are thinking of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're using sublingual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done PK studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that to be the best route of
administration by passing the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of oral, you have to get some
specialized drug delivery to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism by the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are people working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're very happy with the
sublingual use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point I think we'd have to get
a little more sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, for Crohn's and others,
we're doing the sublingual drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 18.8% that dropped out, first,
I don't recall if you gave a dose of THC
[SPEAKER_01]: and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, do you think they dropped
out because the treatment was not
[SPEAKER_01]: effective as opposed to adverse effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they dropped out because the
treatment was not effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sort of happy when I see things
like that, when I see side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see people dropping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, our goal is to get the
THC or the CBD to be a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look in any kind of PDR or
anything, every drug has side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't work in everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm quite happy to see it not working
in certain people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you list a dose?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we didn't list a dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Sid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any studies being done for
mental health conditions to avoid the
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy-duty drugs that are being given?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not in doing those studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think ultimately, if we're doing
Alzheimer's agitation in terms of reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: agitation, I think it should be quite
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in autism, where you're kind of
reducing aggressiveness, I think there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: place for that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a round of applause,
please, for Sid Tubmanfield.
Thank you.
