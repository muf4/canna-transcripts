[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to talk to you today about
something that medicinal genomics has
[SPEAKER_01]: developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's going to revolutionize
testing using QPCR methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been working at medicinal genomics
as an R&D scientist for the past five
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over those past five years,
we've developed a lot of tools to help the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community, particularly in the
genetics of cannabis as Kevin talked
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier about Jamaican Lion, and in
microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So microbial testing, while it's not the
most glamorous, it is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every state that is legal to sell cannabis
has potency, heavy metal testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, it's not the most
glamorous, but it is the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: because the only confirmed deaths in
cannabis have come from microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination, aspergillus in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although with the recent controversy with
vape pens, that might be up for debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's some talks on that
maybe tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we've just heard, cannabis is used
as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are immunocompromised patients
out there, some that don't even realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're immunocompromised.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to make sure that
the cannabis that they're receiving is
[SPEAKER_01]: free of microbial contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's imperative that the testing labs
have the ability to accurately detect for
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful microbial contamination on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's generally two methods that are
out there for microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molecular methods, and we at Medicinal
Genomics have QPCR testing, and culturing
[SPEAKER_01]: methods, which is your traditional,
does it grow on a plate?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both have, as you can see,
QPCR methods have more pros than culturing
[SPEAKER_01]: methods in that it's faster, it's more
accurate, you can specifically target the
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminant that you're looking for,
and it's scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas culture methods are slower,
they're more inaccurate, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: specific, and it's harder to scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing that QPCR lacks that
culture methods has is that, can I go back
[SPEAKER_01]: without messing it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that if the DNA is present,
and a QPCR assay is going to be detected,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't matter if it's live or if it's
dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two types of testing in
cannabis microbial testing, qualitative or
[SPEAKER_01]: presence absence testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this requires that no amount of the
target organism be present in one gram a
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are your four aspergillus
species, aspergillus flavus fumigatus
[SPEAKER_01]: nigritarius, selmonella, staccany coli,
and then you have qualitative or the total
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this allows threshold limits of there
to be microbial contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, total use in mold,
most states have a 10,000 CFU limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total aerobic bacteria, 100,000 CFU.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said before, QPCR detects all
DNA, whether it be live or dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can be a concern in the cannabis
industry because there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators out there that want to make
sure that they're cannabis is free of this
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial contamination so that it will
pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're doing techniques like
irradiating.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're killing the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But killing the microbes still leaves
behind their DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And QPCR methods will pick up that dead
DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've developed a method to solve this
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's called Grim Reifer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said before, the pro of QPCR
testing is that there are primers and
[SPEAKER_01]: probes specific to amplify the DNA that
you're targeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it cannot distinguish between
live or dead DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the solution that we came up with is
eliminate the contaminating dead DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, by this method called Grim Reifer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just gonna go over, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I point to there, let's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a simple upfront 10 minute
incubation at 37 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you do is you add in your Grim Reifer
enzyme along with a buffer into your
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: This all happens before DNA extraction and
lysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grim Reifer enzyme comes in and it
chews up any of your free floating or dead
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: After 10 minutes at 37 C, you add in the
MGC lysis buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lysis buffer deactivates the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lysis buffer while deactivating the
Grim Reifer enzyme also opens up the cells
[SPEAKER_01]: of your live organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thus now you have only your live organisms
DNA present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we've added is we've added a
positive control into this mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this positive control is a DNA
template that you add in to ensure that
[SPEAKER_01]: your enzyme is in fact has been
deactivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will later down the line be
tested in your QPCR reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after you add in your lysis buffer,
you add in positive control and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: proceed with the MGC DNA extraction
procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that positive control is in there
because if you have your original method
[SPEAKER_01]: versus your Grim Reifer method,
you expect that that positive control DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: is not going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be exactly the same CT value as
the original method versus the Grim Reifer
[SPEAKER_01]: method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to test this theory, we took a live E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was an E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli culture that had only been growing
for four hours to ensure that the majority
[SPEAKER_01]: of the culture was in fact live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put that in the presence of hemp
and put it into 12 different tubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six of the tubes were treated with the
original method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six of the tubes were treated with the
Grim Reifer method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And increasing copies of Salamonella DNA
were spiked into each tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were treated 10 minutes, 37 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the 10 minutes,
the MGC lysis buffer was spiked in to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the positive control was added.
[SPEAKER_01]: And DNA extraction happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 12 samples, it was run in triplicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a total of 36 QPCR reactions were run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the results for E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the hypothesis is that due to the
presence of E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, the E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli results for the Grim Reifer method
may be lower than the original method.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli was freshly cultured, E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli results will be more similar between
the methods than the internal control
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, like I said, this was only a
four hour E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, there's no statistical
significant difference between the E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli results and the Grim Reifer results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on your x-axis, you have the increasing
amount of Salamonella DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on your y-axis is the cycle of QPCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes to 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results are consistent with the
hypothesis that the Grim Reifer method
[SPEAKER_01]: does not interfere with DNA from live
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both methods demonstrated robustness
in that there was no impact from the
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing amount of Salamonella DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are the Salamonella results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hypothesis here is that free
Salamonella DNA will not be detected for
[SPEAKER_01]: the Grim Reifer method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until the amount of free DNA exhausts the
enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, the Grim Reifer method
consistently deactivated the Salamonella
[SPEAKER_01]: until you got to the 4.02 million copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that purple bar there is the
Salamonella signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: In QPCR results, the higher the signal
value, the less DNA is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the results from the Grim Reifer
method are exclusive of free DNA as long
[SPEAKER_01]: as DNA is less than 4.2 million copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to give you an idea, a 10-fold
dilution is represented by a 3.3 CT shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the 6.03 million copies,
there was an approximate 12.93 CT shift,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is about a 7,500-fold reduction in
free DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now here's the Grim Reifer positive
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said earlier, the hope here is
that the enzyme is deactivated with the
[SPEAKER_01]: addition of the Mgc lysis buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, you should not see any
difference in your Grim Reifer positive
[SPEAKER_01]: control between the two methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what you see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The null hypothesis cannot be rejected in
the 95% confidence interval since the
[SPEAKER_01]: p-value was 0.161.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no statistically significant
difference between the Grim Reifer control
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Grim Reifer in the original
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this result is consistent with the
hypothesis that Grim Reifer enzyme is no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer digesting free DNA after incubation
and after lysis buffer is added.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both methods demonstrate robustness as
there's no impact from the increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of salmonella DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so another feature that the Mgc QPCR
assays have is we have built in an
[SPEAKER_01]: internal control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's targeting the cannabis DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so due to the inherent presence of
free DNA in the plant material,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would expect that a dried sample is
going to have some dead DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would expect to see the internal
control shift between the original method
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Grim Reifer method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what we see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The null hypothesis, the Grim Reifer and
original method internal control results
[SPEAKER_01]: are the same, can be rejected.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 99% confidence interval since the
resultant p-value is 2.45 times 10 to the
[SPEAKER_01]: negative 25th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a statistically significant
less hemp DNA detected in the Grim Reifer
[SPEAKER_01]: method versus the original method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results are consistent with the
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some QPCR curves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is utilizing four different channels
in the instrument, the FAM, HAX,
[SPEAKER_01]: PSY-5, and ROX channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see if I can get this to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the orange signal that you see here is
the salmonella signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is at 402,000 copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see with the Grim Reifer
method, that orange signal goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you get down here at the 8
million copy levels, you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: salmonella signal very strong here in the
orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it decreases after the Grim Reifer
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an approximate, I believe it's
a 12 CT shift here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's some conclusion summaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grim Reifer method is not metabolizing
DNA in viable cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not metabolizing DNA after
deactivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grim Reifer method is capable of
metabolizing free DNA up to 4.02 million
[SPEAKER_01]: copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the original and Grim Reifer methods
demonstrate a high level load.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both methods demonstrate robustness for
all analytes observed as there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: impact for the increasing amount of
salmonella DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the original method results are
proportional to the amount of free DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: plus DNA in viable cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apologize for the numbering being
wrong there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we had shown that this worked
in the lab, we wanted to see what would
[SPEAKER_01]: happen in real cannabis samples because
we're not a cannabis testing lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have access to actual samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we asked four independent labs if they
would be interested in beta testing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now I'm just going to take us,
so there's a lot of results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to go over our snapshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of picked some from the total
aerobic assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to point some things out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lab one, what you can see here is that
there is a shift in the TAC signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes from 25.2 to 27.95.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also a large shift in the SCCG
signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that internal cannabis control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it go from a 26.21 all the way to
a 32.36.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Grim Reifer positive controls are
very similar for the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you would expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lab two, with the original method,
there was a detection at 25.87.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the Grim Reifer method,
none was detected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this indicates that most of the DNA
that was present on this sample was,
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact, dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that there was a large hex
SCCG signal shift here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet the Grim Reifer method positive
control remains the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what this sample could
have experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the large shift in SCCG signal,
this could have been a sample that had
[SPEAKER_01]: been heavily irradiated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lab three, you can see that the TAC signal
isn't really changing all that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is indicating that most of the
organisms present on this sample are,
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact, alive, as you're not seeing that
CT shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's about a 3CT shift in the SCCG
signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the positive control in the
PSY-5 is similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, lab four, you see a very
large shift, again, in that TAC signal,
[SPEAKER_01]: 26 to 37.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hex signal, there's also a shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the positive control is
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are other free DNA removal
products out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is PMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And PMA is a high affinity photoreactive
DNA intercalating dye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that basically means is that the
dye goes into the double-stranded DNA,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it becomes activated when it's exposed
to light.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this results in a permanent DNA
modification, which renders the DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: insoluble and therefore can't be extracted
through your standard DNA extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dye is cell membrane impermeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that it can't get into the
cells of live DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also other enzymatic treatments
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they require a 15 to 30 minute
digestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also require a 15 minute
inactivation step at 95 to 100 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that inactivation step at such a high
temperature is going to cause the live
[SPEAKER_01]: cells to start to lyse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to have a
competition happening between those cells
[SPEAKER_01]: that are starting to be lysed and the
enzyme being deactivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these both have their faults.
[SPEAKER_01]: PMA, it requires an incubation in the dark
followed by exposure to visible light,
[SPEAKER_01]: either through an LED device or a halogen
lamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: PMA does not work equally across all
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different microorganisms may require
different concentrations of PMA and
[SPEAKER_01]: different exposure to light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And PMA is toxic, which creates a
biochemical biohazard waste stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: As for the other enzymatic treatments,
the product literature that they claim has
[SPEAKER_01]: an average signal reduction of two logs or
about six CTs, which isn't as good as what
[SPEAKER_01]: I had just showed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, what I had just stated before,
the heating the sample to 95 for enzyme
[SPEAKER_01]: inactivation will result in the lysis of
live organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some final thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grim Reaper offers a simple 10 minute 37C
upfront incubation that is nontoxic and
[SPEAKER_01]: easily deactivated without causing harm to
viable organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It results in a three to four log or 12 to
13 CT reduction signal from free DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: The method includes an added positive
control to monitor deactivation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be easily added to the current MGC
DNA extraction protocol and provide QPCR
[SPEAKER_01]: results that are void of dead DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can be used to guide
sterilization protocols at gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to acknowledge our collaborators
that helped us work on this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the team at medicinal
genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a quick question,
which might be obvious to folks that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry here, but I was just
wondering if it sounded as if the
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms are dead and it's not a
concern anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, if you had like a massive mold
infestation on the product and then killed
[SPEAKER_00]: it with radioactivity, would there still
be toxins and other things associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious why the distinction
between living and dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had a major aspergillus
contamination, which produces micro
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins, then yes, I think it would be a
concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every state has different rules and their
regulations as whether they, if they fail,
[SPEAKER_01]: can they go back and be remediated and
tested again?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was under the impression that in
California, it doesn't matter if it's live
[SPEAKER_01]: or dead, but I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are other regulations that do
test for microtoxin testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it was dead and left something
behind, I would think it would come up
[SPEAKER_01]: positive there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this was a really interesting talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not working in this field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little confused at first when you
described this as dead DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it that your test is detecting any
free DNA attached to the cells?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if for some reason there was cell
lysis that occurred during the preparation
[SPEAKER_02]: of the extract, would that skew your
numbers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we call it so a lot of it's basically
viable versus non-viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in culture, methods, you're only
detecting living organism cells that are
[SPEAKER_01]: able to create colonies on your plate,
where in the QPCR, it doesn't distinguish
[SPEAKER_01]: between the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's agnostic.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
