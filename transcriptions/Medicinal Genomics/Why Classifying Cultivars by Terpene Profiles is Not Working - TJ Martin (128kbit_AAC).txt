[SPEAKER_01]: I think most cannabis consumers by now are
familiar with terpenes and sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: role that they play in the experience,
the smells and you know, even the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: experience of consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you point out in the paper that
terpenes are only telling a small portion
[SPEAKER_01]: of the overall story and that sort of some
of these attempts to classify cultivars by
[SPEAKER_01]: their top terpenes weren't really working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So speak a little bit to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean if you look within the
study, we were trying to measure a broad
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of exotic cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from as sweet and fruity as
possible gets something that is dark
[SPEAKER_00]: berry, something that has tropical notes
and that has weird citrus notes like
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy, but also prototypical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look at some of the exotics
and some may be tropical and others may be
[SPEAKER_00]: dark berry and they have a lot of either
limonene or one of these major three
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, but they don't smell the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go to the savory front like
GMO and other savory exotics, they also
[SPEAKER_00]: have similar top terpenes, but their
overall aromas aren't anything close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that doesn't mean that the terpenes
don't impart any flavor and aroma at all
[SPEAKER_00]: and it wasn't part of the research
publication itself, but we did some
[SPEAKER_00]: studies in our lab just to see what would
happen if we stripped all the terpenes out
[SPEAKER_00]: and did just everything else, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this going to smell and taste like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up it didn't smell and taste like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unbalanced and had a very weird
nondescript experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just very unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not until you have everything there
that it has all the balance of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant intended, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have all the everything basically
working just harmoniously together to give
[SPEAKER_00]: it this full experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you strip out that core base of what
makes cannabis unique, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: limonene may not correlate to the exotic
specific nature, it doesn't mean it has no
[SPEAKER_00]: impact to the flavor and aroma of cannabis
that we all know and appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having it all there is super important,
but it's not the defining features of what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's required to give it that full
experience, but it doesn't help to find
[SPEAKER_00]: that exotic note.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that is coming from those esters,
these other new compounds we discovered in
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's almost like music where maybe your
terpenes are your drum kit and your guitar
[SPEAKER_01]: and your bass guitar, but it's really the
synthesizers or the other instruments that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're layering in on top of that that
makes it a unique musical composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly how we started explaining to
a lot of the customers in our sales team
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we try and bring this complex
chemistry and bring it to layers down,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to explain it is just like that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a symphony and you strip out
your string quartets, your strings or your
[SPEAKER_00]: brass, you're still going to have music,
but is it the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like terpenes, they are absolutely needed,
but they're not that the most only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of all aroma, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where, again, this study came in to
show that, hey, terpenes, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have importance and value,
but there's more we haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: considering as an industry that play a
significant role that we should start
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
