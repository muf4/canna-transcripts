[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be the opposite of Kyle here
and I need to bring the microphone down
[SPEAKER_00]: some.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Brian said, I'm a pediatric
neurologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm specialized in epilepsy and
neurogenetics specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some disclosures, I am a consultant for
Cortigen and I'm also going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: some off-label treatment in epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point of my talk is to try to bring
together the topics of epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, and genetics and how to use the
data together to see how we can cater the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment courses for these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to do a quick jaunt through
the brief history of epilepsy and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp was first known as an agricultural
crop in modern Taiwan in 8,000 B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first recorded use of cannabis as
medicine occurred in China about five
[SPEAKER_00]: millennias later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, it spread from China out
west, east, north, south.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the oldest written
recording of epilepsy was in ancient
[SPEAKER_00]: Mesopotamia in 2,000 B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was viewed as a psychiatric
disorder possessed by demons type of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, some of these drawings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the treatment was not very good,
going anywhere from leeching to burrows in
[SPEAKER_00]: the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not exactly the most pleasant of
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we have progressed starting
in 500 B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks to Hippocrates who defined epilepsy
as a medical condition as opposed to a
[SPEAKER_00]: psychiatric condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a Greek physician Galen, a few
centuries later, started prescribing
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana in general, not
specifically for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into modern times, Dr. William
O'Shaughnessy introduced medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: to Western medicine, including the
treatment of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the first recorded history of
medical marijuana being used for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1850, bromide was the first effective
anti-seizure medication that was
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced by Sir Charles Lockhart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, we have had many more
seizure medications introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the point where we're over 30 seizure
medications now, including 1910 when
[SPEAKER_00]: phenobarbital was introduced as the first
synthetic compound, with the most recent
[SPEAKER_00]: being aption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis was added to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacopeia in 1850 as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, in 1914, the Harrison
Act defined marijuana as a crime and
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequently following California,
coincidentally, was the first state to
[SPEAKER_00]: illegalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Dr. Rafael Mercutullo, who we had the
honor of listening to, started research in
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana and started isolating
and synthesizing Delta-9-THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 1970, the Controlled Substance
Act classified marijuana as Schedule I,
[SPEAKER_00]: which basically illegalized it nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the problem started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marinol did become FDA approved in 1985,
so that started opening up some doors
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cannabis receptors,
CB1 specifically, was discovered in 1988
[SPEAKER_00]: by Doctors Howlett and Devane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coincidentally, in 1996, California became
the first state to re-legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the whole modern progression of
medical marijuana started in August 2013
[SPEAKER_00]: when Sanjay Gupta endorsed the product on
CNN program called Weeds and highlighted
[SPEAKER_00]: the story of Charlotte Figi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And GW started their trials soon
thereafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is epilepsy treatable?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying treatable because most of the
time, it's not curable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basically putting a Band-Aid on a
symptom because seizures are a symptom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the epilepsy, which is the disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see here, this is a well-known
study from 2000 from Dr. Brody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first medication, it works
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 50% of seizure patients become
seizure-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you get to the second and third
drug, it's getting worse and worse to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point where the chance that when you're on
the third drug or higher, it's only about
[SPEAKER_00]: a 3% chance that you're gonna become
seizure-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about a third of patients remain what
we call intractable, meaning failing two
[SPEAKER_00]: or more seizure medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the best way to highlight all
this topic is to go through some case
[SPEAKER_00]: presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some videos that are slightly
graphic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to choose more of the benign ones,
but I think it really brings home the
[SPEAKER_00]: point about what these parents and these
families have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first patient is MK.
[SPEAKER_00]: She presented to me at 11 years of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her seizure started at six months with a
high fever after vaccinations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then she had started having seizures
without fever.
[SPEAKER_00]: At her initial evaluation with me,
she had multiple seizure types,
[SPEAKER_00]: tried on multiple seizure medications,
including Oxycobazapine and Lamotrigine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are sodium channel mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oxycobazapine or Trilopto made her
seizures worse, but the Lamotrigine did
[SPEAKER_00]: not, which she's currently on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Development was normal until about a year,
and then she was subsequently diagnosed
[SPEAKER_00]: with autism and was basically nonverbal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And workup was essentially negative,
including basic genetic workup and EEG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And MRI changes that were nonspecific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew the diagnosis right away hearing
this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked Cortigen to send the Epilepsy
Next Generation Sequencing Panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did come back with an SN1A de novo
mutation, meaning she has Dravet syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: She fits that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked them to rush it because the
Epidiolex trials were just about to close,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was running the trials in Orlando at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to get her in quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The importance of this mutation is that
you have to avoid sodium channel blocking
[SPEAKER_00]: agents because it's a loss of function
mutation in general, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a subset of populations, for some
reason we don't know yet, and we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sort this out, is they don't
respond adversely to sodium channel
[SPEAKER_00]: agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, you want to avoid them
because it can bring them into status
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepticus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she was placed in the Epidiolex
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had an immediate 50% seizure
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: EEG showed background improvement,
which is unusual to actually get a change
[SPEAKER_00]: in the background itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was talking much more and had much
more improved eye contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an additional example, I have another
patient, exactly the same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diagnosed before I saw her, put in the
Epidiolex trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was non-verbal.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was eating poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: From day one, we administered the
Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the mom was driving home, she all of a
sudden spat out, Mom, I want food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom basically slammed on the brakes and
said, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first visit that she came back to me,
I was also floored.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was playing on her iPad, which she was
doing before, but I was seeing what she
[SPEAKER_00]: was doing, and she was actually spelling
words on the iPad, which completely
[SPEAKER_00]: floored me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Davinsky kind of went through this
data already, so I'll just go look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see here, they did section out the
Dravet syndrome patients, and they did
[SPEAKER_00]: have a better response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a certain subset of populations
that is going to respond better to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were the phase three data that
Dr. Davinsky already went through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So JA is another patient of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He presented to me at three years of age
with explosive onset of myoclonic
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures, so basically jerking type of
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also started having drop seizures,
as well as atonic seizures, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I clinically diagnosed him with Doza
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Doza syndrome, there's no good
treatment for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say ketogenic diet,
some say very good nerve stimulator,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no good treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was having seizures so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we tried him on certain
medications, he was having seizures every
[SPEAKER_00]: seven to 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine your life like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way a child's brain can develop
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was tried on multiple medications,
including ketogenic diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He completely regressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could not walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could not talk anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: He couldn't even eat anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his workup was basically negative,
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to show you a video of his
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, as you see, his background
EEG is very messy, all those big
[SPEAKER_00]: generalized spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He basically just dropped or jerked every
seven to 10 seconds, and then he had those
[SPEAKER_00]: big seizures, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I really had no more
options for this family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, we can try the vagal nerve
stimulator, but the data is not very good
[SPEAKER_00]: on that, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did send for genetic testing,
and he had two mutations come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was a CHD2 mutation, which,
in the literature, had just been reported
[SPEAKER_00]: at a time associated with severe myoclonic
epilepsy, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it was maternally inherited,
so I wasn't sure if that was the complete
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of went with that diagnosis for
the time being.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mom was asymptomatic, so I wasn't
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also had a second mutation in the
calcium channel, CACNA1A, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: at that time, I didn't believe explained
his symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's only been reported with
familial hemiplegic migraine and episodic
[SPEAKER_00]: ataxia at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was de novo, meaning neither
parents passed it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a little unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kept an eye on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, this past December,
though, there was a few case reports with
[SPEAKER_00]: CACNA1A associated with severe myoclonic
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did talk to the parents about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I gave the parents the blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, we want to move to Colorado and
try CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, go, because it wasn't legalized in
Florida yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after playing with a few different
strains, a few different dosing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we finally got him down to about two to
three seizures a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this kid was having seizures
every 7 to 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a huge improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, one of the emails the family
sent me was just basically they said,
[SPEAKER_00]: he is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our little kid is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was talking again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's participating in regular classroom
settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not quite normal, but he's at least
being able to be integrated into a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's eating again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you see, he looks quite normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not have known like a few months
ago, he was having seizures every 7 to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the calcium channel mutation is
interesting because it works on the P and
[SPEAKER_00]: Q type calcium channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we don't have any seizure medications
that work on those channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have a blood pressure medication
that works on it called verapamil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing I'm going to try him
on next because I'm never happy until the
[SPEAKER_00]: child's seizure free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to try this on the child
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have used verapamil in
seizures before in the Gervais patient
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has helped a subset of those kids
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to kind of see what happens
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: EC, he's a 6-year-old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Global delays noted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad motor delays in speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Became nonverbal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diagnosed with autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started having seizures diagnosed at 3
and 1 half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly tonic seizures where you get stiff
all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been on multiple seizure medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, he's tried everything under the
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was having about 40 plus seizures a
day as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first video didn't have that for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you see here, interictally,
meaning between seizures, he usually has a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of spikes you don't see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he just has some background slowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what he does is he drops and then
he cuts stiff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his background just flattens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a typical atonic tonic type of
seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, he was having about 40 of
these a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just imagine for a kid that is
ambulatory, this is not good because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're falling constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have to use a wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have to wear a helmet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also had these episodes of dystonia,
which the previous neurologist kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: treated him with baclofen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since infancy, also, he had a lot of GI
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cyclic vomiting, alternating constipation,
diarrhea, problems with weight gain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also a lot of behavioral issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hyper, very aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was actually the main concerns
outside of seizures for the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Workup was basically normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microarray showed a chromosomal
deletion that I didn't fit the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ignored that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also sent the epilepsy pen on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came back with two mutations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is in the SCN2A, a sodium channel,
just like SCN1A.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these mutations are different because
they're gain of function mutations as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to loss of function mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was de novo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't inherited by either family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't completely toss it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he doesn't really present with like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the SCN2A kids present with seizures
under a year of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless the parents completely missed
it, he doesn't quite fit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to keep that in my back
pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is if he failed the
treatment that we had for him,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would put him on very high dose
sodium channel agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even then in the literature, that high
dose doesn't get them seizure-free,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at least it helps them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, and this is a
diagnosis I thought about with him,
[SPEAKER_00]: is he had a solute 6A8 mutation,
which is linked to X-linked creatine
[SPEAKER_00]: transported deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was inherited through the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important because as opposed
to creatine deficiency disorders,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't respond as well to the
supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did think about these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when a local lab gets an order
like guanidino acetate, they kind of freak
[SPEAKER_00]: out and have no idea what they're ordering
and just order something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kept getting the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually got these metabolic markers
four and a half months after I got his
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were abnormal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yeah, yeah, I already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left here is MRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see, this is the choline creatine
peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see, his choline peak is much
lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: His creatine peak is much lower than it
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was important information for me
because it tells me that he has some
[SPEAKER_00]: creatine going into his brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some transportive function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, let's go ahead and try the
supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put him on the supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been seizure-free since.
[SPEAKER_00]: His GI issues were completely resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: His improved energy, his EEG basically
normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a few spikes here and there,
but not like the bad EEG background that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was seeing before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I repeated his MRS as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a 50% increase in creatine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I couldn't go higher on his
supplements because if I go higher on his
[SPEAKER_00]: creatine, basically I destroy his kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, he did not have any improvements
on cognition or behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the parents wanted to try CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we did try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's had no improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was limited in Florida as well about
what ratios I could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the laws open up, hopefully they'll
be able to try other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next thing would be try those
high-dose sodium channel agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, there is a clinical
trial in process with a creatine analog
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for these creatine
transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be no delays in diagnosis
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that trial opens, I can enroll him
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mom was inherited because any
future boy she has, it has a 50% risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: having this disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: TC now is a five-month-old male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He presented with these episodes of
behavioral arrest and losing tone for 30,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 seconds, which only occurred when he
was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, neurologically, he was intact
in between episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were his episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EEG background is very normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is during one of his illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you see, he has good enough
strength to pull him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he starts getting wobbly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually, he'll fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a startle response,
not a seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just flops over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the EEG was normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the parents really wanted to know what
was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't have an answer for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said, this sounds like an energy
metabolism problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, let's send for mitochondrial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, we did, because it came
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a solute 2A1 mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which includes for glucose transporter 1
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kid got diagnosed at eight months
of age, which is one of the earliest ever
[SPEAKER_00]: for glucose transporter 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was de novo mutation once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coincidentally, though, they sent me this
video the same day I got the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: report back with these new episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, he just has what we call
oral automatisms, mouth smacking,
[SPEAKER_00]: lip smacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of stares off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be one of two type of
seizures, focal seizures or absence
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But absence seizures really don't exist in
this age group, eight months of age,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the exception of glucose transporter
1 deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the diagnosis early, before he
really became truly symptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: His EEG came consistent with absence
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tapped him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his glucose and ratios were low in the
CSF.
[SPEAKER_00]: It immediately started him on the
ketogenic diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been seizure free since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And has no problems with his
developmental.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can also be enrolled in the
triheptanurin trial if he decides in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future he doesn't want to do the nasty
ketogenic diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is important, because most of
these children don't get diagnosed late in
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have several kids who come to me at
eight, nine years old or older.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these severe epilepsy,
global delays, movement disorders,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the typical triad of Glute 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that time, their brains are already
destroyed and irreversibly bleed damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're placed on the ketogenic diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their seizures may improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their cognitive abilities don't
improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would this be a case where CBD oil may
come into play and help these children?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is cannabis a reasonable option for
treating for seizures?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know it has anti-epileptic
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably has anti-inflammatory
properties that are also helping these
[SPEAKER_00]: kids, because these kids are seizing all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their brains become damaged and
indemnitous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these anti-inflammatory problems will
help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a map from 2006 and 2007,
where these are the states that were
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've progressed a lot since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the current map, including
Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Virginia, that was just approved late
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Pennsylvania, which will also be
pushing a bill through as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a panacea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least one strain is not going to solve
every disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, we can't just have one
drug company test for one ratio on one
[SPEAKER_00]: type of patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would take forever to figure this
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is non-euphoric and non-addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be effective for many diseases,
including many neurological disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativex in Europe for spasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidiolex for Gervais syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is safe, at least in the short-term
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what other diseases can it be
effective for?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of anecdotal data and small
case series, but very little randomized,
[SPEAKER_00]: double-blinded placebo-controlled studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the specific mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what compounds are needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different compounds in
CBD, as you see in the CBD pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microcannabinoids, terpenes, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different diseases will need different
ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much THC is effective,
because we do know THC is also
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-convulsant, meaning it can cause
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the long-term safety data on
this compound?
[SPEAKER_00]: We still need a lot of studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to end with a quote by
Hippocrates himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think that epilepsy is divine
simply because they don't have any idea
[SPEAKER_00]: what causes epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that someday we will
understand what causes epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that moment, we will cease to
believe that it's divine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is with everything in the
universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the case today.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're finding the genetic etiologies of
epilepsies and can kind of cater the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment course of these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can affect the outcome, as with the
glucose transporter 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That diagnosis basically saved this
child's life and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then genetic testing can be helpful as
far as guiding if another treatment is
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So example, that glucose transporter 1
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to treat with ketogenic diet
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to play around with medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have kids that has a CDKL5
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we know nothing works on these kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why mess around and wait instead of
just going directly to CBD and testing
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at responders versus
non-responders based on the metabolism and
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as allowing phenotyping of the
compound to determine contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time.
Thank you.
