[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you gotten your invitation to CanMed
23 yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, then head over to canmedevents.com
now and request your invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, CanMed 23 is an invitation-only event
this year due to the limited capacity at
[SPEAKER_00]: our new location, the Marriott Marco
Island Beach Resort.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say it'll be a small event.
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed 23 will feature three full days of
cannabis science content, including more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 30 presenters and instructors
representing our key focus areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And new for CanMed 23, we will also
explore psilocybin and psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out all the latest information about
CanMed 23 at canmedevents.com,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, we talk to Dr. Allison
Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison is founder and CEO of The Hemp
Mine, a 30-acre hemp farm in South
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina that supplies premium hemp
genetics bred in-house across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hemp Mine produces a wide array of
consumer products ranging from smokable
[SPEAKER_00]: flour to topicals to tinctures of
different concentrations for both humans
[SPEAKER_00]: and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison also co-founded the Cannabis
Research Coalition, a professional group
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated to addressing the cultivation
and post-harvest issues that challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: today's cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison recently co-authored an article in
Cannabis Science and Technology titled,
[SPEAKER_00]: Reading the Leaves, Adventures in the
Leaf-Level Physiology of Cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which takes a deeper look into how
cannabis plants respond to light and CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss the
difference in cannabis photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: rates during vegetative and flowering
stages, the possibility that during
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering leaves in the cannabis flower
take over photosynthesis from the fan
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, why cannabis growers may want to
reduce light intensity and duration six
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks into flower, and conversely,
how maximizing light during flower can
[SPEAKER_00]: increase yield but reduce quality and
possible varietal differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Allison, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Cannabis Science and Technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Science and Technology is your
educational resource for all things on the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It covers the latest developments and
trends in analytical testing, quality
[SPEAKER_00]: control and assurance, extraction,
cultivation, and processing and
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brand furnishes all this information
into a monthly print magazine and also on
[SPEAKER_00]: their website that includes webcasts,
e-books, podcasts, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can subscribe for free on
CannabisScienceTech.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Allison
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Allison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I came across your article that you
co-authored in Cannabis Science and
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology titled, Reading the Leaves,
Adventures in the Leaf Level Physiology of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also saw the conversation that took
place on the LinkedIn post that you did to
[SPEAKER_00]: share that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it'd be a great topic to
discuss on the podcast, not only because
[SPEAKER_00]: the research is valuable to growers,
but also because it's a good example of
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we've talked about a lot on
the podcast and at CanMed, which is this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole idea of we're seeing researchers use
the science to explain some things that
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy growers have learned through
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get too deep into that,
please explain what it is you did with
[SPEAKER_00]: this project and some of the key findings
that came out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this was a project done in cohesion
with Lycor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, Lycor is a bioscience company that
makes all sorts of really cool,
[SPEAKER_01]: unique tools to take a plan and understand
what's going on on the leaf level or even
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes on the cellular level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have tools that do plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have tools that even go underwater
and measure photosynthesis for underwater
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this was a project I was extremely
excited about when Jason and Rod called me
[SPEAKER_01]: and they wanted to get some measurements
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was completely excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using one of these tools, you could
totally say that's a grad student's dream
[SPEAKER_01]: come true because it really takes the
theoretical and let you see on a science
[SPEAKER_01]: level with math and equations and being
able to understand what goes in,
[SPEAKER_01]: what comes out and make conclusions from
there is just really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: These tools are very intricate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be difficult to use, not
difficult to use, just tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really have to understand what it
is you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's not a tool for every grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a tool for every large
corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to make it very clear in the
article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a sales pitch by any means
because these tools are mostly made for
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers, universities, and people that
take it a step further.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that really enjoy plant physiology
and understanding photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, the conclusion here is
taking all of the information we find as
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers and applying it to everyday
learnings of what happens in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very, very high level for this
type of research because it was done with
[SPEAKER_01]: data collected only for two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons more needs to be done for this in
different ways and we can talk about some
[SPEAKER_01]: of those different methods that I would
like to do on a repeat trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think this just brings up some
topics that we can take and further do
[SPEAKER_01]: research, but then also start to compare
to what have the legacy growers done for
[SPEAKER_01]: so long and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from increasing CO2 levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not done just for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that that goes to speeding
up photosynthesis, which ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: increases yields, which ultimately
increases dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it all plays together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not necessarily a tool a grower
would use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that we need to take these
findings and apply it and bring science
[SPEAKER_01]: into the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking at your LinkedIn post,
there were three bullet points that were
[SPEAKER_00]: the key points that came out of your
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that in front of you,
I have it written down so I can read it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one being that cannabis has one
of the highest rates of photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: you said it's up there with corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that a surprising finding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that something that you expected?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean practically for a
grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Corn and I believe sunflower are two
plants that have the highest rates of
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody driving down the road,
you can see how fast the corn grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: how aggressively, if it's watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants are just monsters and very
good at assimilation and understanding or
[SPEAKER_01]: the capability of turning CO2 into plant
material, basically the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a tricky plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always known that as a vegetative
plant, it can handle great extremes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our greenhouse, there's been times the
fans have failed and it gets 150 in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vegetative plants are just fine,
as long as they have water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen cold temperatures under freezing
and the plants are okay, but when you talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about a flowering plant, they're a lot
more finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: What this data shows is kind of why and
puts data to me just saying they're
[SPEAKER_01]: finicky because they can't handle the
extremes as much as the vegetative plants
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all know that cannabis in
general is a beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows very fast, very aggressively.
[SPEAKER_01]: This just shows, yeah, it's up there with
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the hypothesis that the plant is using
so much energy or so much resources into
[SPEAKER_00]: creating flower that it becomes more
susceptible to stresses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the data that we were able to
put and I imagine you'll put the link in
[SPEAKER_01]: where people can read it themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to look at figure two and
three, both of these describe two
[SPEAKER_01]: different processes of why the flowering
plants are less suited to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: problems than vegetative plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as looking at photosynthesis carbon
allocation, taking the CO2 in the air and
[SPEAKER_01]: turning it into biomass again,
and then looking at different light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensities, even though that light is
there, the flowering plants basically
[SPEAKER_01]: throws it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see in figure two,
non-photochemical quenching.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that means is that when the plant
takes it in or when it comes to the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of absorbing it to go through
photosynthesis, it basically throws it
[SPEAKER_01]: away in a form of heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at these graphs, the flowering
plant has a much higher level of
[SPEAKER_01]: non-photochemical quenching than the
vegetative plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, all it says is vegetative
plants can take up just about as much
[SPEAKER_01]: light as you could give them, whereas the
flowering plants throw it away in layman
[SPEAKER_01]: terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This really makes you think about,
well, for an indoor setting where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: control what's going on, because this was
done on a field crop, it makes you think,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, is there reason at certain points
during the flowering cycle to provide less
[SPEAKER_01]: light because it's not actually using it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of legacy growers at the last
couple of weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They turn down the lights, turn down the
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could absolutely be one aspect of
that, but then as was brought up on
[SPEAKER_01]: LinkedIn, well, maybe this is just
considering that the leaves, because keep
[SPEAKER_01]: in mind this measurement is done on a
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one basically centimeter spot on a
leaf in a point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe those leaves are not
photosynthesizing as much during those
[SPEAKER_01]: later times in flower, but the leaves
within the flower material is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: taking over from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about the life cycles and
what you notice, and especially in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field where nutrients, we amend the soil,
we add flowable liquid nutrients through
[SPEAKER_01]: the irrigation system, but still,
it's hard to really provide everything the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant needs in a field setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in a field setting where you do
not have adequate nutrients or quite as
[SPEAKER_01]: much for the most part, towards later in
flower, you'll notice a lot of leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: yellowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's those older leaves that are
yellowing, eventually fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a reason for that,
and that's because the leaves then are
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming a source for that floral
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically just moving those nutrients out
of the old leaves and moving that energy
[SPEAKER_01]: towards the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even indoors, I've seen this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely, that's an effect of nutrient,
but what it really tells me is that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: shift then from photosynthesizing,
potentially, from photosynthesizing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf to that floral material really taking
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way to look at this and conclude
that, again, a lot more work needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: done to have this as the exact conclusion,
but if you think about the folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: really stripped the leaves off the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I was going to bring
that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those who lollipop or the old two-node,
one-node and flip, where they really
[SPEAKER_01]: stripped the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming into the industry a while back,
I saw that and I was like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're pulling off its solar panels to an
extreme, but I have seen incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: When plants are stripped, just as good,
if not better than some that are not
[SPEAKER_01]: stripped.
[SPEAKER_01]: This definitely could contribute to the
leaves not doing as much work then as the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is an interesting plant because
the flower is green.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think of other plants,
there's not a lot of photosynthesis going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no chloroplast there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that all jives together to lean
towards, one, you certainly could cut the
[SPEAKER_01]: light down, but two, is it really that
flower taking over?
[SPEAKER_01]: This leads to the desire I have for
another experiment, hopefully not too long
[SPEAKER_01]: from now, is basically doing these sorts
of measurement in a chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where everything that goes in is measured,
everything that goes out is measured,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's changed inside is measured.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really understand what's going on
with the flower, not just this one leaf on
[SPEAKER_01]: one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that stood out too when
you were taking us through figure two and
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about how when you get into
flowering that the leaves not absorbing
[SPEAKER_00]: that light anymore, it's sort of giving
off heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder in an indoor setting,
is that something that's more commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have plants that are in
flowering, is the room warmer?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're maximizing the light that it can
take up, is it actually enough to heat the
[SPEAKER_01]: room?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such micro units that these plants
are putting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would guess not, but that's definitely
something I'm going to double check.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the conclusions that could be made
from this, and you mentioned that some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the legacy growers might already be doing
it, is that it sounds like, and based on
[SPEAKER_00]: your paper, in the post too, that after
six weeks of flowering, you might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to either back off the intensity of the
light or just even shorten the duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: the light or both?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, because the plant is throwing away
these photons that you're paying for in an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor setting, it would make a lot of
sense to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if the floor material is taking over
for a lot of that photosynthesis that's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening, if you think about,
I guess, square footage of the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: versus square footage of the flowers,
if you were to take the leaves off,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's less square footage, if that makes
sense, of the flower material.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have to really be making up for
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: My theory would be that you could back
off, it's still photosynthesizing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think you could certainly back off
those last weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other things I've noticed that give a
thumbs up to backing off on the lights is
[SPEAKER_01]: really the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people, gosh, I've seen people
in the last two weeks actually go to 24
[SPEAKER_01]: hours light and just pump them full,
pump them full of photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: In certain settings, I have seen that
increase yield, but the flowers look
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start throwing out little fingers,
and as far as being a nice quality for
[SPEAKER_01]: smokable flower, it pretty much ruins it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were just growing these for
extract, which I imagine not many people
[SPEAKER_01]: are indoors, at least those top nice
flowers, it would make it unsellable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is the really high light
intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen that really, and one thing we
should look at is looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: tricholmhazen, is that high light
intensity basically speeding up the
[SPEAKER_01]: process of going from the clear to the
milky to amber?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just speeding that up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is the high light intensity causing
that color change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like I said, I've seen people be
applying 1200 micromoles light and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants almost look burned, especially the
higher colas that are closest to the
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There certainly could be merit to cutting
the lights off the last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and to add to that, the last thought
for that procedure would really be whether
[SPEAKER_01]: you're cutting lights off or providing low
temperatures, are you sending this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier to ripeness?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it doing something in the flower that
we certainly haven't measured yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that contributes to a cure or to an
aspect, decreasing chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that makes the plant taste
better?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say I doubt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the idea of the plant needing
less light in the later stages of its
[SPEAKER_00]: life, that sort of mimics natural
conditions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an annual plant and they're finishing
in the fall like it is now, where the days
[SPEAKER_00]: are shorter and there's less light to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in nature, that's what they get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between the daylight and temperatures,
that all lends to the plant basically
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, let's hurry up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to flower and produce seed where
our species keeps going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, it certainly makes sense
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this data suggests it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think with some other universities,
other experiments jumping in, we can
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely say, at least in the varieties
we test, because there's certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: varietal differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that with many aspects,
whether we're talking nutrients or light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, CO2 or other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that was one of the things
mentioned in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was with your co-author there,
Jason, was mentioning that in other crops
[SPEAKER_00]: that this sort of study and this sort of
data has been generated not just on the
[SPEAKER_00]: species level, but on the varietal or in
our case, the strain or the cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: level, because there are going to be
differences throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That this was just done on one variety
over two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot more that we can learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These tools are used for breeding
projects, whether Monsanto or whoever out
[SPEAKER_01]: there is breeding corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those scientists definitely use these
tools because when you're breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can certainly measure yield versus the
inputs you give it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't necessarily tell how strong
photosynthesis is without these tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can have an estimate,
again, based off of yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this certainly gives a deeper insight
and a good tool for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and to that point about sort of on
the varietal level, I know that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper that you also identified a phosphate
limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the plants that you were looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that something that's sort of
specific to the strains that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that something that can be more
applied broadly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that was an aspect of my field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we try to supplement it as
best we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each year it gets better and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making acres and acres just right
absolutely takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, that's certainly an aspect of my
plants being phosphorus deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows up on my elemental leaf tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows up in the soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this absolutely concluded that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess kind of in general,
was there anything that stood out to you
[SPEAKER_00]: or really surprised you with the data that
you collected with this project?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the phosphorus aspect, that was
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the LIQOR team told me this,
I was like, well, that's probably right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I need to jump back into the
literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time since I've had to
sit down and remember all of the pathways
[SPEAKER_01]: for photosynthesis and why put together
the pieces of phosphate limitation and
[SPEAKER_01]: where that plugs in in the photosynthesis
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, once I dug back into it,
it absolutely makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can give the layman's description of
why phosphorus in general is needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce good flowers or good flowers
because the more photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: the greater yields, but also just in
general with a good growing plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the takeaway there is you
think about go back to biology and high
[SPEAKER_01]: school or whatnot, you know, CO2 goes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant deals with that through an
enzyme called rubisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, it's converted to sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do this sugar conversion process,
there has to be a phosphate attached.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if the phosphate is not there,
the plant is continuing to bring in CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's a backup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a traffic jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, your plant's not getting
those sugars that they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow and to thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so instead, instead of photosynthesis,
it turns to a photo respiration where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not taking up CO2 anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taking up O2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so O2 plugs in there and basically it
wastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the energy, the CO2 is converted to
something else instead of going through
[SPEAKER_01]: the cycle that it should go through,
which makes those sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it creates oxygen instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it takes up oxygen instead of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it plugs in there instead of the CO2.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's, I mean, again,
going back to layman's biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're always taught, you know,
the plant, it takes sunlight and converts
[SPEAKER_00]: it into energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you forget that there's other
nutrients that are, that need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved to make that process happen too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's coming from your soil
or if you're growing from hydro,
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients that you're adding in there.
Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, me as a non-scientist,
I've only recently come to that conclusion
[SPEAKER_00]: after attempting to grow cannabis myself
with, with so-so results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we started talking about this
where, you know, we were hoping to,
[SPEAKER_00]: through this research, give some,
some practical information to growers that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess as we're winding down,
what are some of those things that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can apply based on, on what you've learned
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think, I think one takeaway is
understanding everything you do that these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not balanced, one input would
be a waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me give an example of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a grow room and everything is
perfect except fertilizer, say you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a, you have a organic fertilizer,
you have an organic soil and maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't supplemented it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're, you're limiting something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you'll say your temperatures are
right, your humidity is right,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're giving it 1500 parts per
million CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because of those nutrients being
off, you're basically just wasting your
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 because going back to the phosphorus
and then there's other processes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that, you know, it won't be the same
cycle of photosynthesis process and
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus processes, but there's other
processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have those individual
elements, you know, our 16 essential
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, then all of that CO2 you're
adding is just wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might help a little, but levels,
you know, well over ambient like 1500,
[SPEAKER_01]: 1800, it's just a wasteful input.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding that you need all of
these pieces to be optimal to really
[SPEAKER_01]: increase your yields and put out a good
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes back to the light too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, that's, it's very expensive
running these lights, especially,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, indoors is what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, and if that's being wasted
and you would actually be better off
[SPEAKER_00]: dialing those back, then that's,
I mean, that's a win-win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Allison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, winding down before I let you
go, I did want to give you a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: plug any other publications you have out
there that you want people to be aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: or check out or any, you know,
social media or websites that people can
[SPEAKER_00]: check out to learn more about you and the
work that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please plug away.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, of course on my LinkedIn,
you can see a lot of the articles I've put
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can follow me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dr.justice underscore grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually at least give some sort of
reference to new work we put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, we'd love to have you
join the CRC, the Cannabis Research
[SPEAKER_01]: Coalition.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a farmer industry funded group to
support the hemp mine and Clemson
[SPEAKER_01]: University put out really important grower
relevant research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing, we may include neat tools like
this in our research, but our goal is to
[SPEAKER_01]: then take that research and put it to
something that can be immediately used by
[SPEAKER_01]: the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, everything from looking at
different types of oxen for rooting to
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding well, you know, with a
certain variety, what happens if instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of being just 1212, you move to 13 hours
of light, you know, that's one extra hour
[SPEAKER_01]: of all of those photons, you know,
how can that benefit you?
[SPEAKER_01]: So research like that, that's that's
extremely relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a website, just Google Cannabis
Research Coalition and it'll pop right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love the CRC and hoping to see a
good representation from the group at
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're helping out on the advisory
board and we're very happy to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, happy to have you on the
podcast as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again, Alison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't talk to you before,
then we'll see you down at Marco Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you there.
