[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank CanMed very much for
inviting me and it's like Dr. I'm going to
[SPEAKER_08]: say Michelle who spoke earlier from
Columbia Care.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the first cannabis conference I've
been to since COVID and so it's great to
[SPEAKER_08]: see some old friends, see some new
friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sister Laurel, how are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: And some dear friends on the panel here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've known three of the four for I've been
in this industry for about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: My wife and I, Corinne, I'm not gonna get
emotional now, started this journey in
[SPEAKER_08]: 2010.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis wasn't our lifestyle and I'll
just do a cliff note version.
[SPEAKER_08]: My father-in-law was diagnosed with stage
four lung to brain cancer and he was on
[SPEAKER_08]: 24-7 oxygen and he was declining every day
so every morning we would call to make
[SPEAKER_08]: sure did he make it through the night and
I said I'd like to go to your next
[SPEAKER_08]: oncologist appointment and we went and
Corinne and I found a study that showed
[SPEAKER_08]: 40% of cancer patients pass a malnutrition
before cancer takes over so while we're in
[SPEAKER_08]: the oncologist office we asked how much
time do we have and his oncologist said
[SPEAKER_08]: two weeks and through tears more for me my
father passed about a year and a half
[SPEAKER_08]: prior not from cancer but from a heart
attack.
[SPEAKER_08]: Her grandparents are still alive,
98-97.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were together since age 16 so if
that's not a beautiful way to live and I
[SPEAKER_08]: said what about cannabis for appetite
stimulation not knowing the true medical
[SPEAKER_08]: benefits of this incredible plant and I
call Corinne Mary Poppins because she
[SPEAKER_08]: didn't drink and she didn't smoke and I
said Dean Kerr the caregiver and we did
[SPEAKER_08]: and we went on this journey the blind
leading the blind and back then in
[SPEAKER_08]: 2010-2011 there was no guidance.
[SPEAKER_08]: There wasn't top doctors in this industry,
scientists that were really out there
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about the benefits of cannabis
dosing, dosing there was nothing about
[SPEAKER_08]: dosing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You would say enough for one person but it
was really enough to feed the whole NFL
[SPEAKER_08]: football team with what the dosings were.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we found a coconut, gave him a piece of
chocolate and knocked him on his behind
[SPEAKER_08]: and we found a coconut capsule that the
reason we went that way allowed us to
[SPEAKER_08]: freeze and cut into slivers and within 24
hours he was eating and six months later
[SPEAKER_08]: hospice fires him as a patient and nine
months he was never gonna get scanned and
[SPEAKER_08]: he came back with no evidence of recurrent
disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: We said wow this is a miraculous plant so
we went on this journey to educate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Education is the key not only in life but
especially with this this plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: As the laws in the United States are
growing for cannabis use the lack of
[SPEAKER_08]: doctors knowledge is is far far behind and
so it's tough when a patient calls hey my
[SPEAKER_08]: doctor just recommended cannabis what do I
do now and that's frustrating and so
[SPEAKER_08]: conferences like this conferences I look
at as the ripple effect pebble in the pond
[SPEAKER_08]: ripple effect the education that's going
on so what we've learned here this week
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll take back to our home and share with
our doctors, our families, our patients,
[SPEAKER_08]: etc.
[SPEAKER_08]: 2017 my wife was diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer and she passed four months later.
[SPEAKER_08]: To me success with this plant is saving a
life like who hit a grand slam with my
[SPEAKER_08]: father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other success is getting out of bed,
seeing your loved one, sleep, pain relief,
[SPEAKER_08]: wellness and
[SPEAKER_08]: so I continue this journey this is real
life for me and I know it's real life for
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of people who've been into this
interview and who changed their whole
[SPEAKER_08]: careers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Eloise, Eloise has worked with us for
years she was an oncology nurse to see all
[SPEAKER_08]: these patients passing away from chemo
radiation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was affecting her health affecting her
health and she saw the benefits of this
[SPEAKER_08]: plant she changed her whole career.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bonnie Goldstein the same thing UCLA
studied medical doctor saw the benefits
[SPEAKER_08]: really took a step forward Dustin and
Kevin as well putting their reputations on
[SPEAKER_08]: the line and and it's nice to see that
their stigma of this plant has really
[SPEAKER_08]: dropped because before it was hush hush
hush we're not really going to talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: it so anyway I'm here proud to represent
the medical cannabis community and where
[SPEAKER_08]: we're going.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here with some colleagues that I
admire and I look forward to where this
[SPEAKER_08]: industry is going.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're rock stars in this industry if you
have not already realized that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a resident singer in Eloise
Thiessen so thank you for that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm booking shows in 2023.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how many patients in the audience?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah I think we're all patients yeah but
good good to see you and you know don't be
[SPEAKER_08]: afraid to ask questions because it's not
illegal to ask questions doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_08]: where you live here in the United States
in some countries it is but don't feel
[SPEAKER_08]: this is your body.
[SPEAKER_08]: If your doctors aren't open to this ask
them for a recommendation for another
[SPEAKER_08]: doctor and so I'd like to start off with
Dustin you know one thing that you taught
[SPEAKER_08]: me and I share with a lot of people is
sitting there taking a deep breath and
[SPEAKER_08]: just taking a body check and so I know
we're I don't want to say we're saving the
[SPEAKER_08]: best for last but thanks for sticking
around for this this panel here but can
[SPEAKER_08]: you share I love what you do with that
body.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you spoke about it at the medical
practicum on Tuesday but if you can share
[SPEAKER_06]: it with the audience too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure I'm happy to and for the amazing AV
crew in the back if there's any way to get
[SPEAKER_06]: more monitor on the stage so we could hear
John more clearly that would be great.
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably about seven years ago I was
wondering how to help my patients detect a
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of subtle change in the way that
they're feeling based on a certain dose of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis because it became very interested
in using the lowest effective dose to
[SPEAKER_06]: nudge the physiology using a term from
Kevin so that we don't overwhelm one's
[SPEAKER_06]: physiology we can work in concert with the
endocannabinoid system and instead of
[SPEAKER_06]: undermining it and I developed something
called the inner inventory which is nice
[SPEAKER_06]: it feels good and it just takes about 30
seconds so we could all do it together
[SPEAKER_06]: right now and the way I recommend my
patients do this is to practice the inner
[SPEAKER_06]: inventory maybe write it down in fact our
healer products come with little workbooks
[SPEAKER_06]: and worksheets so you can keep track of
how you're feeling with certain doses of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and really get a highly
individualized treatment regimen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's three measures could be four if
there's a symptom that you're experiencing
[SPEAKER_06]: and you want to check in with that the
first one is breath and so you're gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: rate on a scale from one to ten how smooth
and easy your breath is when you just take
[SPEAKER_06]: one nice deep inhalation and exhalation
[SPEAKER_06]: and so you could just think about what
that number is for you for me it's nine
[SPEAKER_06]: right now and the next measure is body so
just wherever whatever position you're in
[SPEAKER_06]: just kind of remain still there and rate
on a scale from one to ten how comfortable
[SPEAKER_06]: that is
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm at about a six and then the next
one is mood so you could rate how content
[SPEAKER_06]: you feel at this moment or you could put a
fake smile on your face and give it a few
[SPEAKER_06]: seconds and see how real the fake smile
becomes and I'm like 9.5 and then you
[SPEAKER_06]: could rate a symptom so say you were gonna
inhale some cannabis you would maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: recheck that in 15 or 20 minutes or if you
were taking some oral or mucosal cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: recheck that in about 90 minutes and see
if that dose affected you now other things
[SPEAKER_06]: might have happened in that time that
could have changed your inner inventory
[SPEAKER_06]: score and the secret is that just checking
in with yourself is probably gonna make
[SPEAKER_06]: you feel better but that's a good thing to
do anyways you know if we can kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: capitalize on this placebo effect and make
ourselves feel better just by paying
[SPEAKER_06]: attention to ourselves maybe give a little
self-love that's that's just helpful so
[SPEAKER_06]: there we are thanks for checking in
everybody thank you and you are right I
[SPEAKER_08]: can't hear you from here so we're hearing
all the other speakers saying I didn't
[SPEAKER_08]: catch that it's enough can you turn this
on this this I think it's the side one
[SPEAKER_08]: pointing at us might be helpful I wanted
you guys to introduce yourself as well and
[SPEAKER_04]: so Eloise if you like start sure I have
new initiatives I'm Eloise Thiessen no no
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an adult geriatric primary care nurse
practitioner and I'm an osteopathic
[SPEAKER_06]: physician a traditional osteopath been
practicing in Maine for 13 years and using
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis with my patients that whole time
I'm a pediatric trained physician here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Los Angeles and after doing pediatric
emergency medicine for many years I
[SPEAKER_02]: switched to a cannabis specialty practice
about 14 years ago and I am a
[SPEAKER_10]: phytotherapist and let me be clear that's
not using small dogs as therapeutic agents
[SPEAKER_10]: but phyto as in plant or in the states we
say a clinical herbalist thank you so you
[SPEAKER_08]: know I always say cannabis is not a
one-size-fits-all type of medicine age
[SPEAKER_08]: weight current health condition
sensitivities stage and drug to drug
[SPEAKER_08]: interactions and so I was gonna get into
drug drug drug interaction but let's let's
[SPEAKER_08]: talk about this one comes up too and
Bonnie you talked spoke about this earlier
[SPEAKER_08]: is I want the red I want the medical
portion of the plant not the recreational
[SPEAKER_08]: portion of planning we spoke about THC
there's a lot of benefits of T of all the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoids you know when I usually
present I usually have a wall with a roll
[SPEAKER_08]: of duct tape up there and people look at
me like hey dummy you have the wrong the
[SPEAKER_08]: wrong slide up there and I kind of laugh
because when people ask what about this
[SPEAKER_08]: what about this what about this ailment I
don't want to say it's like a million one
[SPEAKER_08]: uses like duct tape but when you really
get down to it really is and there's so
[SPEAKER_08]: many each cannabinoid plays a role THC
we're here in California my brothers in
[SPEAKER_08]: the wine business I'm in Santa Barbara
it's like you know we can have a sip of
[SPEAKER_08]: wine sip of wine sip wine and wine tasting
and the same thing with THC and you've
[SPEAKER_08]: always shared that less is more so can you
talk about the less is more and not only
[SPEAKER_08]: beneficial because it's not covered by
insurance yet but also saving money but
[SPEAKER_08]: also you might find your sweet spot at the
lower amount would you like to talk on
[SPEAKER_08]: that and that in the same thing down there
with you Kevin please sure I'll just jump
[SPEAKER_06]: in real quick a Bonnie showed nice slides
earlier that depicted the internalization
[SPEAKER_06]: of the CB one receptor when it's
overstimulated now we have heard over and
[SPEAKER_06]: over again how important this
endocannabinoid system is in responding to
[SPEAKER_06]: illness and injury in supporting our
growth and development our neuroplasticity
[SPEAKER_06]: we want that system working as efficiently
as possible and when we build tolerance to
[SPEAKER_06]: THC at least to some extent we are
decreasing the capacity of that system to
[SPEAKER_06]: keep us healthy so you know one of the
nice things is that it's easy to reverse
[SPEAKER_06]: tolerance to THC it happens probably more
quickly than a lot of other agents but so
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not like a lot of harm done and maybe
even a useful lesson learned from
[SPEAKER_06]: overusing THC and building tolerance to it
but what I see with my patients is when
[SPEAKER_06]: each person has kind of figured out their
optimal dose of cannabis the retention of
[SPEAKER_06]: efficacy could be decades I mean they
really don't lose the beneficial effects
[SPEAKER_06]: and over time they tend to use less and
less cannabis the dose goes down low
[SPEAKER_06]: slightly we saw that in Ethan's slide this
morning and I think that's because we're
[SPEAKER_06]: becoming more balanced inside we're
establishing a greater homeostatic
[SPEAKER_06]: capacity and and people are healing when
we're less sick we tend to need less
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis so that's my perspective on
always using the lowest effective dose and
[SPEAKER_06]: just to comment yeah that this whole you
know I think it came from CNN this like a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of other things this whole concept
that CBD is medical and THC is
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational it's just crazy and I think
you all know that but for anyone in the
[SPEAKER_06]: audience that hasn't realized that yet
after listening to all these panelists
[SPEAKER_06]: today THC is an incredibly powerful
therapeutic agent and quite versatile it
[SPEAKER_06]: does not need to be psychoactive there's
almost always in every patient a
[SPEAKER_06]: therapeutic window where there's a certain
dose of THC that will create beneficial
[SPEAKER_06]: therapeutic effects and then a higher dose
that will start to create potentially
[SPEAKER_06]: adverse effects which might be impairment
or unwanted psychoactivity thank you yeah
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'll take it from the 30,000 of you
since Dr. Sulek just did such a good job
[SPEAKER_10]: of explaining on the cannabis level so
there's a concept that goes across all
[SPEAKER_10]: biological kingdoms and it's called
hormesis it's had several names over the
[SPEAKER_10]: last decade today we know it mostly as
biphasic response and essentially what
[SPEAKER_10]: that means is that a low dose can be
incredibly beneficial and a high dose can
[SPEAKER_10]: actually even be toxic if not damaging
right so the concept there is that finding
[SPEAKER_10]: the right dose is really key so dose
titration or slowly scaling up your dose
[SPEAKER_10]: to that optimal level is something that I
used to do with other plants besides
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis in the clinic I mean I think it's
really really key to recognize this
[SPEAKER_10]: interestingly a quick story on this is
that in the 19 so the homeopaths back in
[SPEAKER_10]: the early to mid 20th century were looking
for a way to explain their medicine
[SPEAKER_10]: scientifically and of course if you
understand homeopathy truly understand
[SPEAKER_10]: homeopathy there's it's we're gonna have
to change the laws of faces physics and
[SPEAKER_10]: chemistry to really be able to embrace
homeopathy in a scientific way not that it
[SPEAKER_10]: doesn't work I've seen it work and I've
seen it work in in laboratory situations
[SPEAKER_10]: as well but they needed a way to explain
it and so the hormesis concept was really
[SPEAKER_10]: big in the early to early 20th century in
fact there were multiple journals
[SPEAKER_10]: dedicated to just that concept that low
dose could be very beneficial and high
[SPEAKER_10]: dose and you know they were talking about
toxins for example the the guy that has
[SPEAKER_10]: brought it into modern age found by trying
to poison a plant that he actually made it
[SPEAKER_10]: grow more because he diluted the poison
too much and I'm not saying go out and
[SPEAKER_10]: drink poison give me give me clear here
that's not what I'm saying here but that
[SPEAKER_10]: concept of one dose having one effect and
another dose having another effect that
[SPEAKER_10]: bi-physic response so the homeopaths
jumped on this model they were like that's
[SPEAKER_10]: how our stuff works really low doses of
whatever it was whatever the homeopathic
[SPEAKER_10]: remedy was aconitum or arsenic or you know
that's that's how our stuff works well
[SPEAKER_10]: interestingly in a very political move in
the sciences which we're supposed to be
[SPEAKER_10]: immune to the concept of hormesis dropped
off the map and Calabrese Edward Calabrese
[SPEAKER_10]: brought it back in about 1980 and so now
there's hundreds of publications on
[SPEAKER_10]: hormesis so interesting story there the
homeopaths kind of we lost the concept
[SPEAKER_10]: because the horm because of the homeopaths
and I just want to add one other thing
[SPEAKER_06]: about the homeopaths that a lot of you
might not realize but this whole breaking
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis down into two things cannabis
indica and cannabis sativa this was an
[SPEAKER_06]: early homeopathic concept they had two
different cannabis remedies that had some
[SPEAKER_06]: overlapping but distinct features and
again these were just incredibly small
[SPEAKER_06]: quantities of cannabis like to some extent
diluted beyond Avogadro's number where
[SPEAKER_06]: you're just getting an energetic essence
of cannabis and no actual molecular
[SPEAKER_06]: content potentially at least and and that
there were these differences among this
[SPEAKER_06]: plant and so thanks to the homeopaths for
the whole Indica sativa nomenclature
[SPEAKER_10]: nightmare and by the way that's an that's
an really important point is people say
[SPEAKER_10]: homeopathy when they really mean herbal
medicine and they're not the same right
[SPEAKER_10]: what dr. Sulak was just talking about is
dilution beyond Avogadro's number which
[SPEAKER_10]: basically means technically there's one or
two molecules in your remedy depending on
[SPEAKER_10]: how diluted the remedy is so that's why
I'm saying that have to change the laws of
[SPEAKER_10]: chemistry or physics to really be able to
scientifically explain homeopathy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know the discussion of products comes
up quite a bit with patients and so Bonnie
[SPEAKER_08]: you and Eloise spoke about you now there's
an overabundance CBD and now you can't
[SPEAKER_08]: find the good products of THC products out
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you explain the difference to patients
of medical products versus recreational
[SPEAKER_08]: products?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay so they all can be used for either
right yeah I mean CBD dominant CBD you
[SPEAKER_02]: might have to drink the whole bottle to
get a little buzz going but for anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that has THC in it it can be used
recreationally it can be used medically so
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had this come up with a patient
where a parent went in to a dispensary to
[SPEAKER_02]: pick up a product and the person behind
the counter because she has a letter for a
[SPEAKER_02]: child and a caregiver letter for herself
they knew she was there picking up a
[SPEAKER_02]: product for a sick child and the person
behind the counter said well that's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: medical product that's a recreational
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know really what that means it's a
it's a I want this these compounds in this
[SPEAKER_02]: dose to try with that child so why are we
labeling medical versus recreational now
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly something that's 90% THC I think
we could all probably say that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: leaning more towards the intoxicated
medication goal but at the same time I
[SPEAKER_02]: have some chronic pain patients who adult
patients who suffer terribly and have used
[SPEAKER_02]: very high potency just to be able to step
away from their pain even for an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to take your back pain off
or your botched back surgery and walk away
[SPEAKER_02]: from it and then come back later so how do
you disassociate as you can use this
[SPEAKER_02]: medication to step back and distract
yourself and maybe focus on something else
[SPEAKER_02]: for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't make a distinction between
medical and recreational I'm I'm all about
[SPEAKER_02]: what's in the product and what's the
dosing for that particular patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I agree with Bonnie there's you
know in California there's no real
[SPEAKER_04]: distinction right they try to distinct it
by what license you get but the products
[SPEAKER_04]: are all the same and you know I wish that
we could see more products that had more
[SPEAKER_04]: versatility in the THC world we're just
trying to make more and more concentrated
[SPEAKER_04]: products and I think we're missing a large
population that you know I wish the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry could appreciate and I think it
was in now I'm forgetting her name doctor
[SPEAKER_04]: who did the opioid talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking about you know the the
people come back when it's medical when
[SPEAKER_04]: they're using it medicinally they come
back and they purchase it and they
[SPEAKER_04]: purchase it multiple times a day and you
know that's a market that we're missing
[SPEAKER_04]: here an opportunity to really you know
provide for these patients when we're just
[SPEAKER_04]: focused on cannabinoid content you know
I'd like to see us provide more variety
[SPEAKER_04]: for consumers and health care consumers
and patients yeah you know Bonnie you and
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had this discussion over the years
you know with California passing the 21
[SPEAKER_08]: and over and I'm seeing this in other
states as well it's pushing out the true
[SPEAKER_08]: medical professionals because a lot of
patients now say I don't need to go to the
[SPEAKER_08]: doctor I'll just go down to dispensary and
it's unfortunate because I truly believe
[SPEAKER_08]: especially battling is something as
serious as cancer a medical professional
[SPEAKER_08]: should be involved a senior citizen we're
not 21 and you know 1920 21 like won't do
[SPEAKER_08]: that again you know type type of thing
there's so many products out there
[SPEAKER_08]: especially CBD product it's confusing
people ask me what about this I mean
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a there's times that I it's hard
to point them in the right direction this
[SPEAKER_08]: topic comes up all the time and I know
Bonnie you and I have spoken about this
[SPEAKER_08]: about suppositories is there any
bioavailability in there because that
[SPEAKER_08]: comes up quite a bit years ago current I
didn't had wrote an article about is the
[SPEAKER_08]: posterior superior we got a lot of shit
about that one boy leave me and so we had
[SPEAKER_08]: to take it down because there was a lot of
fighting on that one in but I don't want
[SPEAKER_08]: to take I'm not into take giving false
hope but I'm into giving hope and if
[SPEAKER_08]: eating this flower worked with a cancer
patient I'd say eat the flower what are
[SPEAKER_08]: your thought process on different products
especially the suppository discussion
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's coming up quite a bit and
some people say it's working it's working
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm and I don't want to say what you sure
if you can add to that so there's a few
[SPEAKER_02]: ways to look at this so number one if we
look at the clinical research right now
[SPEAKER_02]: there is no evidence that just cannabis
alone and suppository will be absorbed
[SPEAKER_02]: into your bloodstream at sufficient levels
so if you have a suppository that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a study that shows that the cannabinoids
if bound to a compound in this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: research use the drug called hemi
succinate which is that what we call a
[SPEAKER_02]: company permeation enhancer it helps bring
it in it helps cross the barrier that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to cross over to get it into your
bloodstream that actually showed some very
[SPEAKER_02]: good success but that is not what as far
as I know what's available on the market
[SPEAKER_02]: in California I have had patients who
report especially cancer patients back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the day that they reported that they were
doing well but remember that they weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: just doing suppositories they were also on
chemotherapy they were also on vitamin C
[SPEAKER_02]: infusions some of them were taking
mushrooms some of them were taking vitamin
[SPEAKER_02]: C and all kinds of other concoctions I
think it's a very nice thing that they
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to believe it was the cannabis that
was working but when you have so many
[SPEAKER_02]: variables you cannot say what is working
if it's not in your if you have THC in
[SPEAKER_02]: your bloodstream you should have some
effect in your brain if it's in your
[SPEAKER_02]: bloodstream at any you know a significant
level that we would think that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: needed to help kill cancer cells however
in my experience so and I always learned
[SPEAKER_02]: that cancer patients should not be putting
anything up their bum because you're at
[SPEAKER_02]: lower immunity and you can introduce
bacteria into your bloodstream and get
[SPEAKER_02]: septic and if you read about this there
this is a real thing that you can develop
[SPEAKER_02]: sepsis especially when your immune system
is not working well in pediatrics here and
[SPEAKER_02]: there when I first started in this some
parents were trying to put tincture
[SPEAKER_02]: rectally to stop a seizure because there
is a drug called diastat which is a rectal
[SPEAKER_02]: valium which will stop a seizure that's
clinically proven and parents would say oh
[SPEAKER_02]: the seizure stopped and I said I would say
well the seizure is going to stop anyway
[SPEAKER_02]: at some point you don't know if it's the
cannabis or not so we need to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trial to see however in general
that's kind of like most people don't do
[SPEAKER_02]: that anymore I think they're would rather
not do that to their child but in general
[SPEAKER_02]: I am NOT a big fan of suppositories I
think it's kind of a waste of money and
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately there are still a lot of
products out there though that are being
[SPEAKER_06]: used that way I'd like to add a couple
things I think that suppositories can be
[SPEAKER_06]: useful for local problems so if somebody
hemorrhoids is a good example a very
[SPEAKER_06]: common condition itching pain inflammation
THC is great for all of those things
[SPEAKER_06]: vaginal pain can respond to THC I think
that some patients do absorb THC through
[SPEAKER_06]: their rectum because they feel high and
they feel euphoric and good and whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: that patient preparation combination is
great that works well I think where Bonnie
[SPEAKER_06]: was going is that we just hear about a lot
of people that say I need to take these
[SPEAKER_06]: heroic doses of THC but when I do them by
mouth I get so high I can't take it so I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna insert them rectally and just assume
that they're getting into my body and I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: not getting high so it's a great way for
me to avoid this adverse effect and
[SPEAKER_06]: there's one mechanism that might explain
that but it cannot explain it fully that's
[SPEAKER_06]: that when we swallow things all the blood
from the gut goes to the liver first and
[SPEAKER_06]: the THC gets converted into an active
metabolite that's called 11 hydroxy THC
[SPEAKER_06]: might feel a little stronger for some
people but really that's not a full
[SPEAKER_06]: explanation so I just wanted to add that
and then you know when you say some people
[SPEAKER_06]: said that the rectal THC was helping them
even though it wasn't getting them high I
[SPEAKER_06]: just want to point out that there is
something very very interesting happening
[SPEAKER_06]: in the ultra low dose range of THC but
there's a lot more cost-effective way to
[SPEAKER_06]: get that ultra low dose range than putting
a whole bunch of it up your butt and a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: less invasive intrusive and one other
thing there is a study on CBD for in a
[SPEAKER_02]: rectal suppository for colitis so and
remember that's kind of like local
[SPEAKER_08]: application so that's that's what that
looks at Kevin you want to add anything so
[SPEAKER_08]: are there any contraindications you know
with patients that you know liver
[SPEAKER_08]: schizophrenia is there ever a chance ever
a time that were you totally route
[SPEAKER_02]: patients away from cannabis so I had
someone in my office who was full-blown
[SPEAKER_02]: psychotic and I kind of didn't trust her
judgment just in general yeah and so I
[SPEAKER_02]: told her that I this is many years ago I
told her that I could you know see her if
[SPEAKER_02]: a family member would come back with her
just so I could get the full picture I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean she was going off on the people next
door got the tin foil and you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: cameras and stuff and so I just felt
uncomfortable because I really wasn't sure
[SPEAKER_02]: what her status was and I wasn't I'm not a
psychiatrist so I'm not qualified do I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it would have cannabis would have
helped her yes but I just felt
[SPEAKER_02]: uncomfortable at that moment in time I
have a young man in my practice who's been
[SPEAKER_02]: my patient for 13 out of 14 years that
I've been doing this who has
[SPEAKER_02]: schizoaffective disorder and what I did
with him was I in California we normally
[SPEAKER_02]: give a letter for a year an approval
letter I gave him an approval letter for
[SPEAKER_02]: one month and I made him check in every
single month with me so I could just see
[SPEAKER_02]: his progress he has so he had the typical
type of unfortunate course with
[SPEAKER_02]: schizophrenia where he would become
psychotic get hospitalized go on
[SPEAKER_02]: medication do very well he hated his side
effects he would go off medication and
[SPEAKER_02]: then end up in the hospital was this
vicious cycle and I'm happy to say that in
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 years using predominantly THC because
we didn't have CBD back when he was using
[SPEAKER_02]: it he has managed to not have one
hospitalization he has not gone off his
[SPEAKER_02]: other medication low dose THC has helped
him so it can't you you can successfully
[SPEAKER_02]: treat people and I would hear in there I
would get a older adults come in with
[SPEAKER_02]: their children who were adults and say my
son is smoking pot but boy it's so much
[SPEAKER_02]: easier to live with him with his
schizophrenia he's calm he's not
[SPEAKER_02]: destroying the house he takes his other
medication he seems to have some joy
[SPEAKER_02]: because one of the biggest problems with
schizophrenics is they have no joy in life
[SPEAKER_02]: and when you hear a parent coming in and
telling you this is what's happening it's
[SPEAKER_02]: very hard to deny and I remember this is
back when I was first doing this I felt
[SPEAKER_02]: very comfortable recommending cannabis to
those families because there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: caregiver involved and they're reporting
to me what the results are and they're the
[SPEAKER_06]: ones that are living with the patient I
don't think there's any firm
[SPEAKER_06]: contraindications for cannabis I think one
area that we should be extra cautious is
[SPEAKER_06]: in cancer patients that are undergoing
immunotherapy especially the nivolumab
[SPEAKER_06]: drug which has been published in two
studies and shown so this is a type of
[SPEAKER_06]: cancer treatment that revs up the immune
system and causes a lot of inflammation in
[SPEAKER_06]: the body to help the immune system fight
the cancer and of course with cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: being an anti-inflammatory compound we
have to be cautious about not dampening
[SPEAKER_06]: down the effect of that drug but I
wouldn't even say that it's a firm
[SPEAKER_06]: contraindication for example we know that
corticosteroids like prednisone decrease
[SPEAKER_06]: the effectiveness of those treatments but
sometimes when people are on those
[SPEAKER_06]: treatments they'll develop too much
inflammation they can get pneumonitis or
[SPEAKER_06]: colitis or reactive skin conditions eye
conditions and they'll be given prednisone
[SPEAKER_06]: to help settle that stuff down and still
remain on the treatment we know there's a
[SPEAKER_06]: lower rate of efficacy but still they can
complete the course and so I think
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis could be viewed in kind of that
same light it should be used with a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: caution but not a firm contraindication.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Eloise you work with a lot of patients
and what about cannabis use disorder that
[SPEAKER_08]: follows up on some of those maybe
contraindications with maybe a patient who
[SPEAKER_08]: is schizophrenic?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I mean there's definitely diagnoses
I'm not comfortable working with I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: feel qualified to manage and a lot of them
can be complex mental health conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a patient right now who is quite
interesting he's got pretty significant
[SPEAKER_04]: post-traumatic stress and came to me
already consuming 200 milligrams of THC a
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred milligrams at a time twice a day
and his psychiatrist was on the call with
[SPEAKER_04]: us and just said wow you know when he
takes these dosages our therapy sessions
[SPEAKER_04]: are incredible like he's so open and I've
just seen so much great progress in him
[SPEAKER_04]: now I'm starting to see him rely on the
THC in a way that's making me
[SPEAKER_04]: uncomfortable I've increased him to 300
milligrams so his dose is three times a
[SPEAKER_04]: day but I do think we're starting to see
I'm not sure if it's cannabis use disorder
[SPEAKER_04]: or CP1 down regulation but I my concern
about cannabis use disorder from the
[SPEAKER_04]: non-medical cannabis community is I don't
know that they're qualified to be making
[SPEAKER_04]: these diagnoses when they don't really
understand the endocannabinoid system they
[SPEAKER_04]: don't understand the complexity of
legalization and prohibition and so I
[SPEAKER_04]: think it's grossly over diagnosed in
patients and I'd like to see it you know
[SPEAKER_04]: like I said there's diagnoses I'm
uncomfortable with right I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_04]: diagnose somebody with post-traumatic
stress I'm not qualified I don't know that
[SPEAKER_04]: some of these clinicians are qualified to
diagnose cannabis use disorder but I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a conversation we need to be having
in the community because it's very
[SPEAKER_04]: divisive and I would like us to be more
open about you know I see many cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: professionals try to deny that cannabis
use disorder exists I I think I can count
[SPEAKER_04]: on like two fingers how many times I've
actually seen it out of you know over
[SPEAKER_04]: 7,000 patients but you know we do need to
be aware of it we do need to be thoughtful
[SPEAKER_04]: about it like as Dustin was saying you
know I don't know that there's
[SPEAKER_04]: contraindications but we need to be so
thoughtful about how we approach these
[SPEAKER_04]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just make a comment so when we look
at studies on young adults using cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: excessively or what they call chronic
heavy use really what that comes down to
[SPEAKER_02]: is poor judgment how many people know a 15
year old to have good judgment I mean I
[SPEAKER_02]: just survived my son being a teenager and
and he wasn't a difficult teenager and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was still very difficult so I think I
would see you know back again back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: early days of my career being a cannabis
specialist I would get 19 year olds that
[SPEAKER_02]: would come in and 21 year olds that would
come in that had legitimate medical
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions you know you see gymnasts they
in high school they beat up their bodies
[SPEAKER_02]: how about the kids that play football in
high school I mean I had a kid in my
[SPEAKER_02]: practice who's had four shoulder surgeries
by the time he was 16 well he got offered
[SPEAKER_02]: pain pills or guess what his buddies gave
him some cannabis is that a cannabis use
[SPEAKER_02]: disorder now by the way he takes cannabis
he feels better so what is a 15 or 16 year
[SPEAKER_02]: old do they take more it feels good more
more more they have no judgment whatsoever
[SPEAKER_02]: so the idea of this cannabis use disorder
that kind of stems from that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: chronic heavy use in certain age groups
really is just a lack of judgment because
[SPEAKER_02]: I will share with you that with continuity
with these patients because remember
[SPEAKER_02]: before 2018 you needed me to approve you
to get into the cannabis dispensary right
[SPEAKER_02]: so these kids that I would see let's say
18 19 20 with legitimate conditions I was
[SPEAKER_02]: a very interesting phenomenon it was
usually male because I think women are a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more risk-averse and a little more
thoughtful at that age or maybe just more
[SPEAKER_02]: mature but every now and then I would see
somebody who would come in and they'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: 23 or 24 and I'd say gee you know I
haven't seen you in a while it's what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going oh you know I took a break and then
you know I stopped using cannabis for five
[SPEAKER_02]: months I realized I was overdoing it and I
would put my hand across the table and say
[SPEAKER_02]: welcome to adulthood right they're being
thoughtful about their use finally and
[SPEAKER_02]: some of that is just a just being mature
and being ability to start like listening
[SPEAKER_02]: to your body and instead of just kind of
going along with the program so to speak I
[SPEAKER_06]: hope that makes sense I'd like to make a
comment couple comments about that it's
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting because from time to time
patients come to me the most recent
[SPEAKER_06]: traveled from out of state with
self-diagnosed cannabis addiction looking
[SPEAKER_06]: for my help getting off cannabis which I'm
happy to help with the you know my initial
[SPEAKER_06]: response is like thank God you're addicted
to cannabis right it's not cigarettes or
[SPEAKER_06]: alcohol or stimulants or opioids or a
number of other tobacco and a number of
[SPEAKER_06]: other substances and you know I think a
kind of a progressive way of looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: addiction is that the drug isn't the
problem but the drug is the solution and
[SPEAKER_06]: there's some underlying problem so we work
together to figure out what is this
[SPEAKER_06]: underlying problem and how can we best
address it and often it's just a different
[SPEAKER_06]: use pattern of cannabis that can address
it so for this most recent patient who I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean she had a very unique response to
cannabis she literally had to smoke every
[SPEAKER_06]: two hours or she would have a panic attack
get up in the middle of the night to smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: and so forth but by shifting away from THC
dominant type 2 cannabis varieties with
[SPEAKER_06]: more CBD and less THC gradually reducing
her dose layering in some oral dosing all
[SPEAKER_06]: the meanwhile getting to the underlying
problem now she has a balanced
[SPEAKER_06]: relationship with cannabis that's no
longer problematic and I think you know
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis is just so versatile that the
diagnostic criteria for cannabis use
[SPEAKER_06]: disorder is almost like you know almost
any cannabis user could fit into it it's
[SPEAKER_06]: like you go to extra trouble to get your
met to get this substance like you know
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah I have to drive to the dispenser but
but but really what it comes down to I
[SPEAKER_06]: think when I'm working with my patients
and this is an important transition point
[SPEAKER_06]: for people who are healing using cannabis
for healing the question is are you
[SPEAKER_06]: feeling better after you use the cannabis
or are you feeling worse after and and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's interesting as people get healthier
and healthier they've been using cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: as a crutch for a long time suddenly they
don't need it as a crutch anymore if they
[SPEAKER_06]: keep using it that way they're gonna take
some and be like wow I actually felt
[SPEAKER_06]: better but if you didn't ask them that
question they might not realize it and
[SPEAKER_06]: once they hit that point that's a
celebration now we can kind of shift
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis into the form of a tonic like
something that you can use to improve your
[SPEAKER_06]: resilience to stress to stay healthy to
treat acute illnesses and symptoms but it
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't have to be this kind of daily
all-the-time management strategy for you
[SPEAKER_06]: so it's I think an important question is
like are you continuing to use cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: despite the knowledge that it's making you
feel worse or that it's interfering with
[SPEAKER_06]: your life if that is if it's a yes then
there's something there that needs to be
[SPEAKER_08]: changed you're okay no no so following
that so a daily use patient you know we
[SPEAKER_08]: hear this I don't want to be is cannabis
addictive I think it's habit-forming I
[SPEAKER_08]: don't think it's addictive is there a
difference psychological addiction versus
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah yeah well I mean I think maybe what
you're alluding to is this fixation like
[SPEAKER_06]: when people have their attention fixated
on the cannabis and it's like starting to
[SPEAKER_06]: consume their life and that I have seen
and I think there's certainly a way to
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of synchronize with that individual
and help them kind of restore reward to
[SPEAKER_06]: the natural pleasures in their life you
know cannabis is often the solution to the
[SPEAKER_06]: problem that cannabis chooses it's just
you know or the the problem that cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: causes it's just a evolution in that
individual in their relationship with the
[SPEAKER_06]: plants and it is a living dynamic
relationship right and I often feel like
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not the teacher cannabis is the
teacher maybe I can help interpret what
[SPEAKER_06]: this teacher is saying to the individual
so they know how to listen to those
[SPEAKER_06]: lessons and respond and make the changes
that are indicated and I would like to say
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a described cannabis withdrawal
it's THC and it's usually only after very
[SPEAKER_02]: high doses for quite some time I have seen
it in pediatric patients I had two
[SPEAKER_02]: patients different types of cancer both
children very young and very sick where in
[SPEAKER_02]: California they were receiving from my
protocol getting chemotherapy from an
[SPEAKER_02]: oncologist usually some dietary changes
and then we were using high dose CBD and
[SPEAKER_02]: THC of course THC was titrated up and they
were using it over time in the both of
[SPEAKER_02]: them ended up being accepted into clinical
trials in other states and the parents at
[SPEAKER_02]: that time we're talking quite some time
ago they were afraid to travel with it and
[SPEAKER_02]: neither of them really updated me that
they were going to be leaving town without
[SPEAKER_02]: their THC after their child had been on
THC for a while because what I would have
[SPEAKER_02]: done was weaned it down not abruptly
stopped it and I got calls from both of
[SPEAKER_02]: them when a child was at Sloan Kettering
and actually a nurse practitioner called
[SPEAKER_02]: me and said we've this kid is just wigging
out and I said well that's what happens
[SPEAKER_02]: when you stop high dose THC on a dime in a
small child and really what is that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: that down regulation of those receptors
like I showed in that picture and now
[SPEAKER_02]: we're just kind of waiting for those
receptors to kind of come out and what
[SPEAKER_02]: what he just was irritable and he didn't
really want to eat anything and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: over in just about four days I'd say but
he was kind of miserable those four days
[SPEAKER_02]: and so there is and in adults that you if
you've known anybody with who takes a high
[SPEAKER_02]: dose of THC on a regular basis if they
stop abruptly they might feel lousy for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit and it's usually not so bad
they talk about it's a two-week period and
[SPEAKER_02]: usually the first three to four days are
the most difficult a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_02]: want to abstain or cut back by that day
three or four they kind of can't take it
[SPEAKER_02]: so they go back into it and this is why
often times in my experience what I'll do
[SPEAKER_02]: is just continue the CBD because that will
help mitigate some of the symptoms and
[SPEAKER_02]: then just wean down the THC and you don't
have to do it slowly I've usually
[SPEAKER_02]: basically take 25% of the dose away every
day every three days and that seems to do
[SPEAKER_02]: the trick that's just my my protocol that
I came up with and I think one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: gifts of cannabis so everybody's different
but the typical cannabis withdrawal
[SPEAKER_06]: syndrome will begin usually around 48
hours people might feel a little off for
[SPEAKER_06]: those first 48 but the irritability and
loss of appetite and trouble sleeping
[SPEAKER_06]: usually kicks in around that 48 hour mark
and that's actually about how long it
[SPEAKER_06]: takes for people to up regulate their CB
receptors and become more sensitive to
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis so if somebody stops cannabis for
48 hours and jumps right back into the
[SPEAKER_06]: dose that they were using beforehand
they'll have kind of nothing gained from
[SPEAKER_06]: that experience however if they start at a
lower dose and just use the the lowest
[SPEAKER_06]: effective dose to mitigate those
withdrawals symptoms if they're having
[SPEAKER_06]: them or to cause like a change in their
inner inventory then they're actually
[SPEAKER_06]: contributing to this up regulation of
their endocannabinoid system now that that
[SPEAKER_06]: statement is based on some preclinical
data and what I've observed in the clinic
[SPEAKER_06]: but but in general I think that this is a
really forgiving part of this plant also
[SPEAKER_06]: that if we build tolerance to it we can
reverse it quickly and effectively without
[SPEAKER_06]: having to endure a brutal withdrawal
period and CBD can help with with the
[SPEAKER_06]: those 48 hours exercise there's all sorts
of ways to successfully sensitize one
[SPEAKER_06]: system to THC into cannabis and we have a
free program on healer.com that'll walk
[SPEAKER_06]: you through that hold your hand show you
videos give you worksheets and other
[SPEAKER_06]: activities that you can do to be
successful with that if any of you are
[SPEAKER_06]: regular moderate to heavy cannabis users
and you haven't tried taking a 48 hour
[SPEAKER_06]: break and sensitizing your system I highly
recommend you give that a shot and see
[SPEAKER_04]: what you find yeah and I think what is
really important here too I've seen
[SPEAKER_04]: withdrawals with CBD high CBD use but I
think what's what's really interesting is
[SPEAKER_04]: if you've ever gone had a patient go
through withdrawals from opioids or SSRIs
[SPEAKER_04]: or other medications it's nothing compared
to the withdrawals they might have from
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis so you know I always tell them
yeah you might have a little diarrhea you
[SPEAKER_04]: might be difficult to be around but it'll
be over quickly I mean my personal
[SPEAKER_04]: experience with opioids was a month of
withdrawals and symptom management and
[SPEAKER_04]: when I said how long is this gonna last
they said a week and I said well I'm in
[SPEAKER_04]: week three and he said four I mean they
just don't know right and they don't offer
[SPEAKER_04]: you any solutions so the good news at
least with cannabis it's a lot easier to
[SPEAKER_04]: come off of if you need to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you you know following that what
about hyperemesis syndrome with the
[SPEAKER_08]: patients that I guess taking is it
normally just with too much THC is it
[SPEAKER_08]: normally that you're seeing him in
teenagers and 20s and 30s or?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's THC related it's usually not medical
cannabis patients although I've seen two
[SPEAKER_02]: cases in my career so that's in my career
it's not very common but I got yelled at
[SPEAKER_02]: by a GI doctor who yelled at me and said
it's all over the ER so how come you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not paying attention well because I work
in the medical side of this not the adult
[SPEAKER_02]: use slash recreational side or where
teenagers are just doing it without some
[SPEAKER_02]: direction or self-medicating and again
poor judgment leading to overuse but the
[SPEAKER_02]: two cases that I saw were people who went
from kind of what I would call moderate
[SPEAKER_02]: THC use to the very high potency dabbing
and the concentrates and one patient it
[SPEAKER_02]: took six ER visits to get the diagnosis
because she didn't disclose and for
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever reason they never did a talk
screen they thought it was pelvic
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammatory disease or a ruptured
appendix she got working worked up for a
[SPEAKER_02]: ruptured spleen even though she had no
just kind of trauma I mean that so there
[SPEAKER_02]: was a lot of money spent on her work up
and when she finally admitted she was very
[SPEAKER_02]: upset about it because she felt that she
did something wrong and now she couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: use cannabis anymore because any time that
she went back to it she would have a
[SPEAKER_02]: recurrence of symptoms but we were able to
get her on some CBD oil to help with the
[SPEAKER_02]: original diagnosis which was anxiety and
then the second patient I had could not go
[SPEAKER_02]: back on to cannabis at all or at least THC
cannabis no he couldn't do it yeah I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it gets complicated if you have somebody
who has CHS and they have to stop abruptly
[SPEAKER_04]: now you're also gonna possibly have
withdrawal symptoms I mean it can be
[SPEAKER_04]: really problematic but I think there's
I've noticed at least in my medical
[SPEAKER_04]: practice there are some people that end up
in that prodromal phase where they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: actually vomiting yet but they have early
morning nausea maybe some weight loss
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe some diarrhea and so I think you
know it's really good to be aware of the
[SPEAKER_04]: different phases so that you can try to
catch it but I've also I mean Dustin and I
[SPEAKER_04]: wrote up a couple atypical CHS cases and
sometimes they can go back sometimes they
[SPEAKER_06]: can't and I think maybe we should define
this does anyone want me to define CHS
[SPEAKER_06]: does everybody know what we're talking
about okay so cannabinoid hyperemesis
[SPEAKER_06]: syndrome usually occurs to long-term heavy
THC users and it's a violent nausea and
[SPEAKER_06]: vomiting episode that can last a day or
days and it's typically relieved by
[SPEAKER_06]: excessive hot bathing and and that heat
temporarily turns down the nausea now
[SPEAKER_06]: there's another clinical entity called
cyclic vomiting syndrome that presents
[SPEAKER_06]: very similarly but the difference is
cannabis can help cyclic vomiting syndrome
[SPEAKER_06]: the thing about CHS is that people don't
know it's related to their cannabis it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not like they just took a hit and the
episode suddenly started it kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: appears out of nowhere so they're baffled
by it and the the kind of test to see is
[SPEAKER_06]: this really CHS is stop using cannabis for
a month and you know see if an episode
[SPEAKER_06]: comes back or not now in the atypical
cases we presented they were there were
[SPEAKER_06]: some lower GI symptoms I believe that CBD
dominant cannabis in both our cases
[SPEAKER_06]: trigger to relapse and and so so some
people are so ultra sensitive or maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: it's some of these trace compounds that
daddy's waiting to discover for us and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not the THC at all that that's
certainly possible but I think that often
[SPEAKER_06]: like Eloise mentioned there's this
prodromal phase where before the episode
[SPEAKER_06]: kicks in if they pay attention they're a
little off in the morning and if they stop
[SPEAKER_06]: using cannabis before it goes to this
full-blown episode wait a few days then
[SPEAKER_06]: that'll subside and they can actually
start using it again very cautiously but
[SPEAKER_06]: never in my experience able to go up to
that full high dose where they were
[SPEAKER_06]: previously and I've had about a dozen
cases over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to point out that Dr. Russo
and Len May from Endocanna Health did a
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic study to look at if to see if
people were genetically predisposed and
[SPEAKER_02]: they found some very nice results so I
encourage you to read that article I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it came out last year I believe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the lights blinking over there so I
had a couple other questions but let's
[SPEAKER_08]: just go with you know over the past 12
years I've seen so many changes in this
[SPEAKER_08]: industry some good some bad and some
really exciting times ahead what what can
[SPEAKER_08]: you all add to the future of our industry
and and and beyond.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kevin I'll start with you my friend.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well in terms of the future of the
industry I mean a couple things need to
[SPEAKER_10]: happen really big politically that needs
to settle down right making access not
[SPEAKER_10]: making people criminals not punishing
parents who are giving their kids
[SPEAKER_10]: medicinal cannabis for good reason I think
those are really keys but also I think
[SPEAKER_10]: quality control and labeling is still an
issue in a lot of states and you know I
[SPEAKER_10]: come from the natural products industry so
to me we're trying to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: industry is trying to reinvent the wheel
and you don't need to you already have a
[SPEAKER_10]: guide the American Herbal Products
Association will guide you through all
[SPEAKER_10]: those steps of what you need to do in
terms of quality control and and labeling
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know all of this so I think we
need to learn from the existing model
[SPEAKER_10]: that's out there to improve our safety our
quality control our adverse event
[SPEAKER_10]: reporting I think that's really really key
there are cases of adverse events and we
[SPEAKER_10]: need to know who they who these people are
and why they're responding in a negative
[SPEAKER_10]: way and that's gonna propel the industry
forward it sounds like it has set it back
[SPEAKER_10]: but it won't it'll propel it forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I just have one ask and that is to
get it off the Controlled Substance Act so
[SPEAKER_02]: we can research it.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I think about cannabis you know it
seems always so perfectly fit to our
[SPEAKER_06]: contemporary problems in society our
health problems our psychological problems
[SPEAKER_06]: you know you look at this this world we're
living where there's huge amounts of
[SPEAKER_06]: psychological stress and cannabis is a
solution for that where we're you know
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of bathed in this environment of
toxins many neurotoxins we have the
[SPEAKER_06]: neuroprotective effects of cannabis you
know and so on it's often this solution to
[SPEAKER_06]: our most challenging problems in health
care and I you know hope that we stay
[SPEAKER_06]: open-minded and allow it to kind of evolve
with some of these challenges one in
[SPEAKER_06]: particular that was brought up earlier
today is and yesterday as well is just a
[SPEAKER_06]: rate of mental health challenges that the
adolescents in our world right now I think
[SPEAKER_06]: it's it are experiencing it's just an
incredibly hard time for most to be a
[SPEAKER_06]: teenager with the social media and the
technology influence and algorithms really
[SPEAKER_06]: learning quickly how to dictate behavior
and you know kind of bring people away
[SPEAKER_06]: from their authentic self and high stress
of this kind of cognitive dissonance we're
[SPEAKER_06]: living in a world where people are doing
things all the time that just don't make
[SPEAKER_06]: any sense and telling them to follow these
things and do them and they might know it
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't make sense but they're doing it
anyways so I've seen a huge uptick in
[SPEAKER_06]: adolescents in my practice and they are
you know either the parents are cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: friendly or cannabis curious and bringing
them in because they don't like these
[SPEAKER_06]: psychiatric options that are available or
the parents are discovering that this this
[SPEAKER_06]: kid is using cannabis and kind of
punishing them and telling them to stop
[SPEAKER_06]: and then watching their you know kind of
social interaction and grades and family
[SPEAKER_06]: communication and relationship deteriorate
and then you know telling the pediatrician
[SPEAKER_06]: hey I think the cannabis was helping
pediatrician says go see dr. select and we
[SPEAKER_06]: validate what this young person is already
found so that's one example of an area
[SPEAKER_06]: where I hope we see our kind of culture
able to embrace cannabis for that
[SPEAKER_06]: population as well and I know it's very
helpful for me when I was 15 years old and
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have a fraction of the challenges
that today's young people have and I hope
[SPEAKER_04]: to see more health care professionals
become educated because then it increases
[SPEAKER_04]: our advocacy our opportunities for
research our access you know as health
[SPEAKER_04]: care professionals we often are able to
consume if we're taking positions at
[SPEAKER_04]: institutions or organizations that you
know try to use the 1980s drug place work
[SPEAKER_04]: acts to say you know you can't test
positive I want to see health care workers
[SPEAKER_04]: access this plant in a way that's
meaningful of a really high burnout rate
[SPEAKER_04]: right now we're all talking about mental
wellness and and how to help with the
[SPEAKER_04]: burnout and I'm like oh oh I know let us
all use cannabis please for the love of
[SPEAKER_04]: God you know I think you'll see much
happier health care workers not that they
[SPEAKER_04]: need to consume at work but I just I want
us to I mean we all deserve choices most
[SPEAKER_04]: so many of us raised our hands that were
patients right we deserve choices so
[SPEAKER_04]: congratulate for beat yourself for being
here today and getting educated and being
[SPEAKER_08]: part of the change thank you very much you
know we're all ambassadors for this great
[SPEAKER_08]: plant and we're all the pebble in the pond
that hits that ripple effect so bring it
[SPEAKER_08]: home with you and thank you all for being
up here and thank you for joining and
[SPEAKER_08]: thanks for can med and all the sponsors as
well and thank you thank you to the can
[SPEAKER_06]: med crew it's been a great conference and
I think we are welcome welcoming questions
[SPEAKER_04]: if the audience has any and pictures
anybody want to take some pictures of us
[SPEAKER_04]: please thank you I'm gonna do my screw put
in my scrapbook I've got a question over
[SPEAKER_05]: here in the in the recreational market
we're seeing an increase in the use of
[SPEAKER_05]: nano emulsions to make the cannabinoids
water not water soluble but immersed in
[SPEAKER_05]: water products so beverages are coming
online gummy products are being made with
[SPEAKER_05]: nano emulsions I haven't heard anybody
talk about those types of products here
[SPEAKER_05]: and I was wondering if anybody could
comment on patients that are using maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: these new nano emulsion products and how
the dosing of those could be different
[SPEAKER_05]: from the dose of traditional products
because of more rapid absorption sure so
[SPEAKER_06]: you know I think one part of that is
getting the cannabinoids and other
[SPEAKER_06]: compounds into a matrix that's desirable
and you know that's fine if if somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: prefers to have it in a water-based
beverage and it gets in there better that
[SPEAKER_06]: that's okay when it comes to claims about
increased bioavailability meaning you know
[SPEAKER_06]: I can take a lower dose and it's gonna
have a stronger effect I we've seen very
[SPEAKER_06]: little data supporting any of those claims
I think a couple companies have published
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit and what we've seen is that
there can be like a three to four fold
[SPEAKER_06]: increase in absorption from some of these
nano emulsions and other technologies now
[SPEAKER_06]: it's also important to know that if you
take oral cannabinoids with fat containing
[SPEAKER_06]: food you'll also see about a three to five
fold increase and and so the the cost
[SPEAKER_06]: benefit of some of these technologies
which do raise the cost of the product
[SPEAKER_06]: typically I think we could probably just
achieve that by by taking it with food and
[SPEAKER_06]: you know for the consumers out there if
somebody's advertising something fancy and
[SPEAKER_06]: new that's gonna improve the delivery of
cannabis I'm all for it I would just you
[SPEAKER_06]: know invite the company to show us the
proof that it's doing what they say it's
[SPEAKER_04]: doing yeah I agree I think there are a lot
of unsubstantiated marketing claims in the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry and working with knowledgeable
health care professionals can really help
[SPEAKER_00]: a patient make good choices first I want
to thank you all for being here I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to have you all in one place to
ask this question over the last couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years with the passage of the farm bill
we've seen a lot of other cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: heading the market Delta 8 Delta 10 HHC
some of those types of things and I'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear what your opinion is on some of
those products that are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: circumvent the THC laws and prohibition of
states okay sure well my first concern is
[SPEAKER_10]: residual solvents that that's obviously an
issue and it's been an issue in the past
[SPEAKER_10]: as well I know in in Oregon we had this
problem I think that the other
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoids you know for the most part
we've got pre-clinical research we don't
[SPEAKER_10]: have a lot of human research that doesn't
mean necessarily that you know we can't
[SPEAKER_10]: use them but if they're isolated and we
can get much higher doses I tend to fall
[SPEAKER_10]: on the safety side you know these things
have never been isolated and we have never
[SPEAKER_10]: taken them at higher doses so they've
always been in a mix as minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_10]: so that makes me feel better to think of
it that way than isolating a bunch of
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff that we've never tested on humans or
even pre-clinical research and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: chime in so the way it's been explained to
me is that the Delta 8 THC that's on the
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp market now is not from directly from
the plant it goes through a what's called
[SPEAKER_02]: acid catalysis from CBD to Delta 8 and the
concern there is that you may convert
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say 80% of that CBD over but then
the rest what are those and they basically
[SPEAKER_02]: saying they're uncharacterized either
cannabinoids or something else and nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: knows so far I'm waiting for somebody to
say oh I figured out what those are and
[SPEAKER_02]: the concern is what are they and are they
safe for you so that that's the way it's
[SPEAKER_02]: been described to me I have had a few
patients use Delta 8 with some nice
[SPEAKER_02]: results with anxiety in lower doses and
especially in patients who don't seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerate Delta 9 but there's still that
concern of safety yeah I'm okay with
[SPEAKER_06]: people experimenting on themselves you
know I think life's a big experiment you
[SPEAKER_06]: know that that's all right I think they
should just do so with the knowledge that
[SPEAKER_06]: there's probably unidentified compounds
that they're consuming and we don't know
[SPEAKER_06]: what that's going to do to them and it's
probably going to be different from one
[SPEAKER_04]: preparation to the next yeah and I don't
think our testing is very sophisticated
[SPEAKER_04]: either so that's another concern where you
can see there was a report that came out I
[SPEAKER_04]: think it said like 56% of at least Delta 8
products were mislabeled you know we saw
[SPEAKER_04]: that was CBD as well and there's a lot of
people that don't realize that there's
[SPEAKER_04]: also likely to be Delta 9 THC in some of
these products so it can be quite
[SPEAKER_01]: impairing Nicole I thank you very much for
being here and for doing all that you do
[SPEAKER_01]: my my question is this one of the things
that we're finding as we speak to the
[SPEAKER_01]: practitioners is their fear of stepping
into this culture my question to you
[SPEAKER_01]: because all of you are so open and
especially dr. Goldstein because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: directed for someone who we know who is a
pediatrician that we're trying to help
[SPEAKER_01]: move into that cannabis space what
recommendations do you have just to
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate to the doctors the
practitioners anything to to kind of allow
[SPEAKER_02]: them to step into this so I had a little
difficulty hearing you but you're asking
[SPEAKER_02]: me what would I say to other pediatricians
well what I would say is your fears are
[SPEAKER_02]: unfounded because I'm the biggest chicken
around and I'm doing this so it is your
[SPEAKER_02]: fears are unfounded and it's based on
research from the you know dare to say no
[SPEAKER_02]: time and even from before that but
everybody talks to me all the time what
[SPEAKER_02]: about the brain development about this I
just don't see issues and if I saw issues
[SPEAKER_02]: of course I would step in do no harm right
so I'm not ignoring my patients and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can tell by my slides and my talk I am
heavily involved in my patients lives I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean I have some patients that email me
three times a day with pictures so we are
[SPEAKER_02]: very there I'm like closer to them than I
am to some family members if something
[SPEAKER_02]: goes south and I stress this at every you
know talk with the first the first
[SPEAKER_02]: appointment and every talk after if
there's a downside of a side effect
[SPEAKER_02]: anything you're worried about there is no
stupid email or phone call you just let me
[SPEAKER_02]: know I try to prepare people but in
general if you are practicing good
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine the same way you practice any
other good medicine whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: rheumatology or hematology oncology and
you know especially what cannabis it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot safer because you're really not going
to harm anybody you may not find the
[SPEAKER_02]: answer right out of the gate but if
someone's willing to work with you usually
[SPEAKER_02]: can find some benefit the fears are
unfounded and I've been saying this for
[SPEAKER_02]: years and yet there's still a tremendous
fear factor and part of that is the
[SPEAKER_02]: ignorance because you don't know because
you haven't had a chance to read the
[SPEAKER_02]: research so it's just a matter of
education but I think part of it too once
[SPEAKER_02]: someone once said to me doctors are really
good students they're taught something
[SPEAKER_02]: once and they hang on to it for life so
it's very hard to undo I wanted to add to
[SPEAKER_06]: that you know this came up earlier and
it's I think a little better for nurse
[SPEAKER_06]: practitioners but physicians have the
highest suicide rate of any profession we
[SPEAKER_06]: are mostly damaged by our training
incredibly closed minded and rigid in our
[SPEAKER_06]: thinking and scared of things that we've
been told to be scared of and so we don't
[SPEAKER_06]: learn very well while we're scared our
brains are not discern designed to learn
[SPEAKER_06]: when we're scared we're designed to react
emotionally and so when you find an
[SPEAKER_06]: intelligent person that's reacting
emotionally the first step has to be to
[SPEAKER_06]: help them feel safe and comfortable and do
something that will help disarm them and
[SPEAKER_06]: you know I think there's a variety of of
ways that we can just synchronize with the
[SPEAKER_06]: person we're talking to this isn't about
breaking through to them and getting the
[SPEAKER_06]: truth to them that's that's not the
effective strategy the effective strategy
[SPEAKER_06]: is basically like sit there with this
scared rigid thinking individual that's
[SPEAKER_06]: missing an opportunity to really like help
a lot of people and have a much more
[SPEAKER_06]: meaningful career sit with them and see
how you can love them and like look at
[SPEAKER_06]: them and love them that's probably a
really nice first step that'll change the
[SPEAKER_06]: vibration in the room and and then maybe
like take a different tact like not for
[SPEAKER_06]: their patients maybe this could be
something for themselves or for their mom
[SPEAKER_06]: who's got arthritis or someone else they
know and just kind of find where those
[SPEAKER_06]: inroads are and and I say this from
experience it's gotten a lot better when I
[SPEAKER_06]: used to be in front of a crowd of doctors
not at a cannabis conference but a
[SPEAKER_06]: different conference you could feel the
energy in the room like you know they
[SPEAKER_06]: would be it would be so intense the fear
about the words that were gonna come out
[SPEAKER_06]: of my mouth there was no way I could teach
a crowd like that you know and and now
[SPEAKER_06]: it's the work has gotten a lot easier you
know because people are I think you know
[SPEAKER_06]: and I mentioned this in my book cannabis
is not just a solution for the patients
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a solution for the practitioners and
for the system itself it's a solution for
[SPEAKER_06]: their miserable practices that are you
know full of toxic tools that are
[SPEAKER_06]: ineffective and it's a solution for their
personal lives if we can weave it in there
[SPEAKER_04]: somehow so those are some of my ideas
that's great I mean I need to applaud that
[SPEAKER_04]: right there yeah and I think so much of it
is false evidence appearing real you know
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the fear for me going now into
palliative care at Stanford I'm gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: prescribing opioids for the first time in
my career and I'm way more scared of that
[SPEAKER_04]: than I am cannabis so you know it's all
about perspective and I want
[SPEAKER_08]: self-promotion so I think you all have
books right sort of sort of anyway look
[SPEAKER_03]: Lola yes so thank you so much guys for
what you're doing in this space okay yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: this is really great I hate this stuff
okay so my question I'm a clinical
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmacist a cannabis circulator
consultant I'm also a cannabis educator so
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier when Dr. Boston was talking she
said about the route of administration
[SPEAKER_03]: first of all where I'm coming from when it
comes to cannabis and not even just
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis medication drugs generally I
believe is all in your route of
[SPEAKER_03]: administration and you're dosing and when
you look at conventional medicine big
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers they have perfected the act of
route of administration and one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: areas is in your transdermal patches like
your fentanyl and suppository those are
[SPEAKER_03]: one of our effective the most effective
agents routes that we have so I will say
[SPEAKER_03]: that when we look at the way we are seeing
cannabis as a suppository we are we have a
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling is not really where we need it to
be do you guys think this is a way this is
[SPEAKER_03]: an area where we can actually collaborate
with the big farmers when we eventually
[SPEAKER_03]: get into that area where we have
legalization and everybody can actually
[SPEAKER_03]: come into the opens and embrace this this
plant because I really do feel that
[SPEAKER_03]: suppository is is gonna be a game changer
as well as transdermal patches I think
[SPEAKER_06]: that we could advance cannabis in that way
I have to say in 13 years of clinical
[SPEAKER_06]: practice I can't recall when I've been
dissatisfied with my available routes of
[SPEAKER_06]: administration what we've got right now
seems to be working very well maybe it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not the most cost-effective but then again
newer technologies that can enhance
[SPEAKER_06]: bioavailability they have a cost as well
so I think we'll probably make progress
[SPEAKER_06]: there but I don't see that as a priority
in cannabis I'm curious what my panelists
[SPEAKER_03]: think for me personally I just feel like
especially when you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer or folks that have nausea and
vomiting especially when you are looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at the the fact that when you use a
sublingual route of administration we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't even know what about availability of
this agents are and we already have proven
[SPEAKER_03]: routes of administration that is extremely
effective that's why we have problem with
[SPEAKER_03]: fentanyl that is one of the main reason
why we have problem with fentanyl because
[SPEAKER_03]: of the way the absorption rate I think
that when someone needs a parenteral route
[SPEAKER_06]: of administration the lungs is ideal the
onset is so rapid it's very easy to
[SPEAKER_06]: titrate again I'm not really seeing the
need but but there are some patients that
[SPEAKER_06]: do better with a patch Eloise presented
that case and thank goodness for that
[SPEAKER_06]: ultra sensitive outlier that there was a
patch available I think maybe patches I
[SPEAKER_04]: would love to see more variety and
opportunities for four patches in the
[SPEAKER_04]: market I mean I'm very limited and they're
very very expensive but sometimes they are
[SPEAKER_03]: game-changers okay thank you guys for what
you do appreciate that yeah and I'm just
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna chime in here if I'm not anti-pharma
but I do think pharma is at the root of a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of problems in medicine if you if we
try to collaborate with pharma with
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis they're just gonna take it away
from you that's what they're gonna do it's
[SPEAKER_10]: all about corporate it's all about profit
I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: not saying it's bad but but we're it's
we're not being exclusive we're being
[SPEAKER_10]: inclusive that's the way I see it this is
a grassroots movement it's not exclusive
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah I don't think anyone else here yeah
I'm sorry because the rest of the room
[SPEAKER_06]: can't hear you unfortunately but the
message is that we can collaborate and I
[SPEAKER_06]: think that's a great well we don't have to
be anti-pharma I don't think that's that's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to help us but we have to know them
for what they are and and recognize the
[SPEAKER_06]: patterns of history in the way that
they've behaved we can invite them to
[SPEAKER_06]: behave differently and maybe if again if
cannabis becomes a bigger part of their
[SPEAKER_06]: life they might do that let's let's take
the next question thanks Dr. Goldstein
[SPEAKER_07]: mentioned the one patient who had had
repeated hospitalizations and that seemed
[SPEAKER_07]: to be solved with the low dosage THC I was
just wondering what was the actual dosage
[SPEAKER_02]: and what would you define as that low dose
range sure he he actually was inhaling
[SPEAKER_02]: with a flower vaporizer so I don't really
know but he would just take one or two
[SPEAKER_02]: puffs and he would spread it out
throughout the day so it was kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: micro dosing via inhalation all day long
and it just kept him even and so he found
[SPEAKER_02]: that that was the best way to do it and I
didn't want to change that I wanted him to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to decide how he what worked best
for him and this was flour not oil it was
[SPEAKER_02]: flour yes you would buy flour and he used
not a volcano but kind of like a one-off
[SPEAKER_09]: from a volcano type bag vaporizer so I
have a few things to add to this someone
[SPEAKER_09]: asked a question earlier and a paper came
out today that may have shed some light on
[SPEAKER_09]: this it's in chem archive from Munger et
al and it is vaping cannabinoid acids
[SPEAKER_09]: leads to ketene formation which is a
poisonous gas they think may have been
[SPEAKER_09]: involved in the valley with vitamin D
acetate so encourage people if you're
[SPEAKER_09]: looking at some of these other products
this is specifically about Delta 8 and
[SPEAKER_09]: Delta 8 acetate which might be some of
these other Delta 8s that are showing up
[SPEAKER_09]: in this this acid catalyzed catalyzation
but something new that just published
[SPEAKER_09]: today that may shed some light on what are
in these vape pens but I'm also going to
[SPEAKER_09]: add to this that I'm Kevin McCurnan and
I'm here to let everyone know that we have
[SPEAKER_09]: finalized can med 22 and I wanted to thank
everyone involved for it I also have some
[SPEAKER_09]: exciting news in that many of the sponsors
of this event have come back in droves
[SPEAKER_09]: with much support for next year so we have
survived kovat which is great can med will
[SPEAKER_09]: happen next year we're still sorting on
where we usually do two years in each
[SPEAKER_09]: location so it's about time for shift and
we'll be sending out emails in regards to
[SPEAKER_09]: where it's going to be probably in the
next month what with that I want to thank
[SPEAKER_09]: all of our panelists and everyone who came
this is a really have been a fantastic
[SPEAKER_09]: year and long overdue and we're looking
forward to seeing everybody again at the
[SPEAKER_09]: next event thank you you
