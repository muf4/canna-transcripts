[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt, the marketing
manager at Medicinal Genomics and proud
[SPEAKER_02]: member of the team that puts on the CanMed
Conference every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Head over to canmedevents.com now to learn
all about our CanMed 2021 event that will
[SPEAKER_02]: take place April 12th through 14th at the
Pasadena Convention Center in Pasadena,
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And get your tickets today at our special
early bird rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other news, we've started a Facebook
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each year, we are consistently blown away
by the amazing presentations, inspiring
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations, and important connections
that are made at the annual CanMed
[SPEAKER_02]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided to keep the conversations
flowing online with our CanMed Community
[SPEAKER_02]: Group.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CanMed Community is our virtual forum
allowing you to interact directly with
[SPEAKER_02]: many of the CanMed Conference speakers,
past attendees, and other group members to
[SPEAKER_02]: discuss all things cannabis from bench to
the bedside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the link in the show description to
visit that group today and join.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode's guest is Hope Jones.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the CEO of Superior Finos LLC,
a hemp young plant production company in
[SPEAKER_02]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's also CEO of Emergent Cannabis
Sciences, an international cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: micropropagation consulting company with
clients in Colombia, Australia,
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany, and Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope has deep expertise in both hemp and
cannabis, often serving as an expert
[SPEAKER_02]: consultant on forming policy at the state
and federal level.
[SPEAKER_02]: NASA also tapped her micropropagation
expertise to develop programs for growing
[SPEAKER_02]: plants on deep space missions.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our conversation, we talked a lot about
tissue culture, as Hope will be leading a
[SPEAKER_02]: panel on the topic at CanMed 2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: We covered how cultivators use tissue
culture to remediate plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: infected with pathogens such as powdery
mildew and hoplite and viroid,
[SPEAKER_02]: how the COVID-19 pandemic has actually
made Hope's culture and conversations with
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators about plant viruses and
pathogens much easier, how tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: can produce changes to the plant's DNA,
why alcohol is not an effective antiviral
[SPEAKER_02]: solution for plants, how cryogenic storage
of tissue-cultured mother plants can be
[SPEAKER_02]: used as an insurance policy against
pathogen infection or other disasters,
[SPEAKER_02]: and much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to that conversation,
I want to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicinal Genomics uses its unmatched
knowledge into the cannabis genome and the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes that impact cannabis plants to
create a diverse set of testing solutions
[SPEAKER_02]: that improve crop yield, accelerate
breeding, and ensure product safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of the top cannabis testing labs
trust MGC's PathoSeq microbial safety
[SPEAKER_02]: testing platform to test for
state-mandated microbial targets,
[SPEAKER_02]: making it the industry's preferred
microbial testing method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, labs and cultivators can use the new
PathoSeq cannabis virus multiplex assay to
[SPEAKER_02]: test plants for hoplite and viroid,
lettuce chlorosis virus, and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cryptic virus in a single PCR reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn more at medicinalgenomics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wouldn't be the Can Med Coffee Talk
podcast without some good coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that, we always turn to the hemp
and coffee exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know, hemp coffee is a
healthy, delicious, natural product rich
[SPEAKER_02]: in trace minerals and nutrients,
providing sustained energy without the
[SPEAKER_02]: crash of regular coffee.

[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without any further ado, I give you my
conversation with Hope Jones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited to talk with you about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our audience may already be familiar
with tissue culture because I did speak
[SPEAKER_02]: with Mark Jordan in a previous episode and
we discussed tissue culture and mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: around sort of how it's performed and the
different stages of tissue culture and how
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole process works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for this conversation, I'd really like
to talk with you about how tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: can actually be applied in cannabis and
hemp cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe a good place to start is,
can you tell me how widely used is tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture in cannabis and hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: So tissue culture is widely used in
practice when it comes to regular,
[SPEAKER_00]: I say regular with quotes, regular
agriculture, horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started doing cannabis tissue
culture, I realized nobody's doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're doing a lot of cloning,
it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will, I'm sure get into all the
other advantages to tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was actually pretty shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then not surprising once I thought
about it, that nobody in the cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp industry had been approaching that,
at least not at any kind of real
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial scale that I had seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes sense given the nature of
the cannabis industry having to be
[SPEAKER_00]: underground for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you to actually even think about
doing something along those lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it made sense to me when I thought
about it, of course, and I thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I have an opportunity to contribute
to this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just parked myself, I feel at home
and I'm happy to help the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what it can do, what its
potential benefits are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really there are cons that come along
with it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure we'll get to all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's start with the pros.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some reasons that cultivators
should be using tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think probably the most commonly
understood would be the idea that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a lot of clones in a very small
amount of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that you can take one cut and
that cut should have a node, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can either culture that node or we
can culture the very tip of that node we
[SPEAKER_00]: call the meristematic cells up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way, you can just take a part
of a plant and you can plate it onto
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the media has everything a growing
plant needs for growth, development,
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamins, the obvious elements and
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do that in a small,
think of a baby food jar or deli cups
[SPEAKER_00]: about that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have multiple plants in each one
of those vessels or each one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings in one of those vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have good, healthy stock in
those vessels, then you're off to the
[SPEAKER_00]: races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really comes down to the IP of
the nutrient that's within that media on
[SPEAKER_00]: what your actual multiplication rate can
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on average, let's just let's say at
least two to four X.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one cut gives you two or four
additional plants after about four weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: is the way we think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's probably the most
popularized understanding of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture for any plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis in particular, to me,
the reason why I do it is because we are
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with a plant that was grown
underground for obviously decades and
[SPEAKER_00]: decades and decades and bred for one thing
only, and that was not disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bred for obviously cannabinoid
production and high THC in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have plants that are pretty weak to
environmental stresses and diseases that
[SPEAKER_00]: come along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so tissue culture allows us to try to
eradicate those diseases and generate
[SPEAKER_00]: stock in a lot of it, as I was explaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when done right and using testing to
verify, we should be able to produce a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of clones that don't have known diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really why I do it,
because we're dealing with, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: an epidemic when it comes to diseases,
because we do have some very focused
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for so long that it's going to
take a while for these breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of great ones out there
busy working and doing this to generate
[SPEAKER_00]: more strains that are resistant to various
environmental stresses and diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really interesting that you
mentioned pathogens and diseases that are
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coincidentally here at Medicinal Genomics,
we're developing an assay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we just released an assay to
test for viruses within the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly poplite and viroid, lettuce
chlorosis virus, and cannabis cryptic
[SPEAKER_02]: virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll say the response that we've
gotten from the cultivator community
[SPEAKER_02]: around those assays has been very strong,
which seems to jive with what you were
[SPEAKER_02]: just saying, that there seems to be a bit
of an epidemic when it comes to diseases
[SPEAKER_02]: among the cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very interesting that you say
that, just because we've been experiencing
[SPEAKER_02]: that ourselves too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that's a good topic to get into
as far as how can tissue culture be used
[SPEAKER_02]: to remediate plants that maybe are showing
some signs of infection?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I love your guys' company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love companies like yours because we
need the ability to be able to test,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's not enough companies out there
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cost of it is still really high
because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people are still becoming
educated about the process of testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: how frequently to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the more that companies like
yourself, others, consultants and
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries like myself who are out there
helping these cultivators be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce and produce on margins that are
getting smaller and smaller, we must have
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to be able to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we must be able to do something
about it once we find out let's just get
[SPEAKER_00]: to one of the big ones, the hoplite and
viroid, for example, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get that sucker, what the hell
are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with plant tissue cultures,
so the strawberry industry is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberries are very susceptible to
various pathogens and viruses and viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to use disease as a
generic term that is every kind of fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial virus viroid as a generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then probably just use hoplite and
viroid for the sake of our conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: for something as a specific example when
it comes to one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But strawberry is really susceptible to
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they have done is they have
generated clean stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because using plant tissue
culture and since Mark had previously
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed how the various stages to go
through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, once you go through those stages,
so I'm not going to go back over it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but once you go through those various
stages, well, we can keep testing and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't take a big sample size to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to flower the plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even need to take it out of its
vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can continue to test throughout the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we do once we know that we have
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a common day in the life of Hope
Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a call from a particular company
who's really struggling with yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just say they used to have their
favorite strain and it used to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: yields and percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this strain is no longer doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because just like with COVID out for
us in our pandemic, well, plants also get
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses and viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with like the hoplite and viroid,
you have to know what the symptoms are to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have a problem because obviously
there's not enough understanding out there
[SPEAKER_00]: within these companies to know what the
symptoms necessarily are until oftentimes
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I show up at somebody's
facility, I've seen these symptoms now for
[SPEAKER_00]: so long that I'm just, ah, you know,
I put my hands in my pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not touching anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to tour anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what I'm dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I do that is because
these diseases almost every single time
[SPEAKER_00]: are very easily transmitted by us,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call that, you know, mechanical or
yeah, mechanical transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can take a plant from their
facility and my R&D lab in Arizona is
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm taking a plant from somebody's
facility back to my lab and I'm working
[SPEAKER_00]: with taking cuts from this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sending it to a third party lab for
testing and identification of these
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always know what I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm going to start the process of
trying to dissect the smallest parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant that I can, that will survive
in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes that's, that's that
maristomaniac cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why do we, why do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know from decades and decades of
research and other plants that have these
[SPEAKER_00]: various diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why this is this particular
disease is hoplite and viroid is it was
[SPEAKER_00]: originally identified in hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Closely related plant to us makes a lot of
secondary metabolites just like our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has resin glands just like ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty good place to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just like we see reduction in
yields, well, so do the hop growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were seeing, you know, in papers back
into the early 80s when it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: identified and characterized, you know,
reductions in oil production by up to 40%,
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer lateral branching and which,
you know, that's going to give you less
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass, all of these problems,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so very similar to what we're seeing,
plus we've had companies out there
[SPEAKER_00]: identify and characterize the hoplite and
viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can take the smallest piece
possible, and if I can learn from these
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants species where the highest
density of these particular particles are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant, well, I'm going to try to
avoid taking cuttings from that part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to try to go and,
and, and, you know, theorized any way that
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroids seems to really
populate in the roots in the base of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is that true in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's yet to be wholly characterized
and determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I'm going to actually say,
I'm going to go for the tips anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to take as the healthiest
tips that I can, and I'm going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: those meristematic cells and why the
meristem instead of the node.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do that is because a lot of
these diseases have a tendency to localize
[SPEAKER_00]: and travel through the plant in the
vascular.
[SPEAKER_00]: System.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conveniently, the meristematic cells are
not connected to the vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we carefully excise that those
meristematic cells from the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be able to rescue tissue that does
not harbor any of that disease or those
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it's been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in so many other plant species,
strawberries turn this into very feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Process and it's still commercially
viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to use a model out there
that an approach that with cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way, because that's a industry that's
focused on providing in their industries
[SPEAKER_00]: and any industry, but cannabis certified
stock that is disease free or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: free of the disease that they're
specifically testing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, we should be able to do that,
but there's just not a system set up to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are working with plant tissue
culture companies, those would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I would ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you testing for?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going about that process?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you be sure that when I get it,
that it doesn't have that particular virus
[SPEAKER_00]: or viroid or whatever your problem is,
but that's our approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And financially, if we get to a point
where we're constantly dealing with this,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they have with a hoplite and viroid
and other viruses in the hop industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to continue with that example,
they've been dealing with this for 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years of research and they've yet to
eradicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're seeing they, and the reason
why they spent all of that time and put in
[SPEAKER_00]: decades and decades of research is because
it affects the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it affects the taste and the
bitterness and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes about those secondary
metabolites that are produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: like those alpha acids that that's being
used, but we're seeing those reductions,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that hurts and we cannot continue
down that road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to try to attack this problem
from multiple approaches and tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture is but one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it sounds like tissue culture is
really used when, you know, a problem has
[SPEAKER_02]: been identified and you're trying to kind
of salvage the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But can it be used sort of proactively as
your propagation technique?
[SPEAKER_02]: And will that always produce something
that's clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It should if it's done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the individuals that are doing the
plant tissue culture are tracking their
[SPEAKER_00]: rounds of multiplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's more, you know, if the ability
to use molecular markers allows us to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure we're not getting DNA variants,
which can happen, that would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least we know the chemical profiles
and if the plants that are being produced
[SPEAKER_00]: are still producing the expected chemical
profiles, because, again, the goal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a clone, not to produce a variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, we should be able to
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see more nurseries,
tissue culture nurseries coming about,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's no reason in the world why
we should not be able to produce clones at
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cost that comes with it,
but anything in our industry comes with
[SPEAKER_00]: certain costs and it's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't necessarily have to be good
at everything if there's nurseries and if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's options for, you know,
being able to purchase that from
[SPEAKER_00]: neighboring companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned DNA variants,
which stuck out to me because,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, here at Medicinal Genomics,
we do a little sequencing work on cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what sort of variations can you see as
a result from tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what we can see in cannabis,
we're going to have to just compare to
[SPEAKER_00]: other plant species that that's been very
well characterized in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even those companies like myself and other
good companies around the country and
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada or other places in the world are
doing amazing research, but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: always publish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's going to be a long time before
we know all the types of DNA variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in many other plant species,
it's known that you can get, if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching your tissue culture correctly,
if you want to maintain clones but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing something and your media is
not right or you end up getting what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called a lot of callus cells, those are
undifferentiated cells that develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when a plant forms a bunch of
undifferentiated cells is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, they're not actually signaled to do
anything yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they they're not signaled to be a stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not necessarily signaled to be a
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not necessarily signaled to be,
you know, a leaf or a another node.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just there, which means if any
kind of signal or or or change happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it's going to go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm being oversimplified,
kind of oversimplifying the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can get a lot of what's called DNA
off types or DNA variants that happen from
[SPEAKER_00]: that, where each cell out of that puddle
or pile of callus cells can can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it because of an actual genetic change,
something that happened to the chromosome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on what the stressor was.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was something to cause DNA damage
that can absolutely happen just during
[SPEAKER_00]: normal rounds of replicate DNA replication
as a cell divides, you can get DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: replication errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that definitely happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you then propagate those cells up
into new shoot material and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it on a different media to get
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then now you're going to see
different expressions potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what those genetic changes
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything's always visual,
but oftentimes they can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a pile of cells and
callus cells that are all
[SPEAKER_00]: undifferentiated, you can have millions of
cells depending on how many cells are
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can imagine that you now have
just in the size of like a dime,
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially cells that could have a bunch
of different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not DNA, actually something
that's modifying the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see epigenetic changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So epigenetic changes are things that
happen over time due to some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental cue that causes the cell
that it might have a localized response or
[SPEAKER_00]: it might have a systemic response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a plant is constantly getting some
sort of signal because they can't move,
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to adapt to their
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're going to these signals can
then all of a sudden induce a regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway, upregulation, downregulation,
what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those can also happen in a bunch of
callus cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're going to see different
epigenetic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one way I like to think about
it, where my lab's at, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: the hell, but this park parking lot,
everybody that there's one way to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: down and park your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, people like to drive
the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that now causes me every single
time I'm leaving my getting in my truck to
[SPEAKER_00]: not you don't assume anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're constantly looking on both
directions and going slow because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: busy parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you were in a different
environment, you would have never had that
[SPEAKER_00]: signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would never be really
hypersensitive to having to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think you can imagine how if
you had a bunch of cells that all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden had some sort of signal changes in
chromosome structure, different DNA or RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation patterns are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can check out a library book
that you never had access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're getting a different
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can also be used for good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't it just means why are we doing
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we approaching it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want clonal production or actually
do we want to kind of get into that R&D
[SPEAKER_00]: side of stuff?
It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I understand the epigenetic part
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that that can even happen with
clones like in traditional cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But are you saying, though, that with
tissue culture, there can actually be
[SPEAKER_02]: actual changes to the DNA sequence?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it more of an epigenetic sort of
response?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both, both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, are there papers out
there in cannabis that have done cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture that have looked at
molecular markers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, thankfully, there are a few
papers out there and there's only going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more and more coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have molecular markers like like
like your company is actually a great
[SPEAKER_00]: resource to be able to to to start
utilizing the power of what a molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: marker can do for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can not only have the ability to
sequence something so we can see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been major genetic changes,
we can also look at molecular markers to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if we're having amplification of
something or if it's completely
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is known in other plant species,
yes, both actual changes to DNA can happen
[SPEAKER_00]: and epigenetic changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If if and because of all that,
you know, decades and decades of research,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of us in the cannabis tissue culture
industry know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are cognitive of if even if we
don't have molecular markers or
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing, everything is, is there are
there logical approaches that we can take
[SPEAKER_00]: to mitigate that or, you know,
try to mitigate that risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are because of all those decades of
research and other plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's careful selection of your
medias.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's looking for those that
callous those callous formations at the
[SPEAKER_00]: base of your nodal plants as you're doing
your tissue culture, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: not not doing callous unless you really
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are approaches that are,
you know, well described.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least we have a logical way to
approach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ideally, after plants gone
through culture, even if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing it, you should be flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we obviously want to flower it
out, make sure it still has the same
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical profile, because clonal tissue
culture should not change what its DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: potential or what its genetic potential
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be introducing, you know,
genes for limonene, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: to create new terpenes unless but unless
that plant actually already had the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic code to be able to produce that
particular compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do the flowering out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look for the chemical profile,
but you also look for the architecture and
[SPEAKER_00]: the the habit of this particular strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's a strain that you know very
well, you know likely what its growth
[SPEAKER_00]: habit is and you know what its chemical
profile should be and it should be
[SPEAKER_00]: performing pretty damn well compared to
what you started with before you gave it a
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture bath, shall we say?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the risk of the risk of plugging
medicinal genomics yet again, we recently
[SPEAKER_02]: came out with a snip chip, which is sort
of a more cost effective way to to get
[SPEAKER_02]: some sequencing information on the plant
without having to do, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: full on sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a snip panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder if a tool like that would be
useful for tissue culture just to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, screen against the original
plant to just make sure that there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiation between the the snips that
are being called.
[SPEAKER_00]: My God, man, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The simple answer is just yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think any of us doing plant
tissue culture wouldn't love to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize tools like that, whether with a
third party and sending it off or
[SPEAKER_00]: in-house, but just yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my favorite R&D and thing to do in
this industry is to be working with
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders and other growers on a breeder
spending a lot of time, the good breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: to generate these new genets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they should be rewarded for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to get their genetics
out in the marketplace and they should be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to feel confident when their genetics
are in the marketplace that their genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: are, in fact, true to type, that they are
optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then that way, there's there's there's
accountability on all ends that we get we
[SPEAKER_00]: get to choose where we are the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to choose what we buy, who we do
business with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that comes down to why would we
want to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, I would want to do business
with somebody who was, in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing tools like you were just
describing and then working with breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to protect the integrity of
their genetics, but also be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they wanted to validate or if they
want if there was a dispute about
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, you know, it's it's been a long
time for these breeders to be able to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I I spent years, you know,
generating this particular strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: My God.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the fact that it can just get
out there should be a choice for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: make, not just because somebody can just
take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in horticulture and agriculture,
if you see the hot new, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: rose that's out on the market and there's
always a tag that goes along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why there's a tag is because
those companies that generated those
[SPEAKER_00]: particular cultivars are those are getting
paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a royalty that goes with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if some company ends up selling that
particular rose without the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing rights, well, then a obviously
you have the ability to use markers or
[SPEAKER_00]: snips and sequencing to be able to,
you know, to enforce your trademark patent
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if somebody is actually growing
something of yours as well, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that whoever is selling that
product or representing that product on
[SPEAKER_00]: your behalf is doing it in the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using markers, for example,
or just understanding the genome is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: way to actually have the best
understanding of in this environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant when grown under these
conditions with these substrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: with this nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you buy something again from a
nursery, typically comes with those
[SPEAKER_00]: climate light and other requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if somebody is growing something
of yours and they're just excuse my
[SPEAKER_00]: language, but they're just a shitty
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that represents that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a reflection of their brand
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these tools can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all aspects of our industry,
it's just pretty complicated right now as
[SPEAKER_00]: our industry is still very young.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a common common refrain in a
lot of these conversations I'm having with
[SPEAKER_02]: folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, you know, the industry has a lot
of learning to do, has a lot of growing up
[SPEAKER_02]: to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot to learn, which is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, bring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to be at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's such a, you know, this is a once
in a lifetime opportunity to be a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: a brand new industry and something that's
so huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we love doing doing CanMed
as well, to bring all these people
[SPEAKER_02]: together from the different facets of the
industry, whether it be cultivation or
[SPEAKER_02]: safety testing, or even the healthcare
professionals who are using the medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: to treat patients too, to really learn
from each other and kind of see where we
[SPEAKER_02]: can help each other and move this whole
thing forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys are really great at doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the education of everybody,
because we all do want to learn,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to stay small shitty growers
forever or struggling with all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not why we do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you guys are really, really
important avenues for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we talked about how to use maybe
tissue culture to remediate plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: are infected with pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do know that your company,
Emerging Cannabis Sciences, you also work
[SPEAKER_02]: with integrated pest management systems to
sort of maybe prevent things like this
[SPEAKER_02]: from happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you could speak a bit
to that and kind of how that can be used
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Important acronym of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrated Pest Management.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the most important thing in any
cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't care if you're a company that
only does retail because you can't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: retail operation if you don't have any
product to put in the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't actually care about the
product on your shelf, people are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get wise and they're going to shop
elsewhere, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we want good quality, predictable,
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to do that is actually to
be aware of all your cultural practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the IPM is absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about, first of all, the genetics as
soon as they are coming into your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the biggest mistakes that I
see, and I love seeing like the easy light
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb moment, is like everything must go
into quarantine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So integrated pest management isn't only
about pesticides or scouting and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for actual insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is about how to mitigate that risk in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll always have problems as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to mitigate our risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it starts with, as soon as you have
genetics coming into your facility as
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, or if you're popping seeds,
you've got to have some sort of place to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to isolate those plants until you
have an understanding of their health
[SPEAKER_00]: status before you introduce them into your
mother population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that's probably the number one
thing that most companies, they may think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, or maybe they're not sure how to
go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does take space out of your growing
square footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times, nobody necessarily
wants to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has to be done because almost
everything that I say in cannabis when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to any disease happens through
mechanical transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are bringing in, I take in
people's problems for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get hemp genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm opening up literally a mite bomb,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm getting these cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're checking them in,
which is another thing that is really
[SPEAKER_00]: critical for IPM strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by checking them in,
well, physically looking at the damn thing
[SPEAKER_00]: before I just throw it in a population,
it doesn't have to have something crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive, just a microscope that allows
you to be able to see things like russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites and small eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so I'm opening up, and it's just
like, oh, russet mites, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to just throw that into my
population?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I now then have to have the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do for all incoming plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to be able to isolate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to have a strategy for any
pesticides I can use in my state,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I should be using, what I shouldn't
be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then immediately make sure that my
staff is appropriately trained to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to handle and do all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then follow it up with a specific
regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, all independent of
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do the same thing in my own lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually, you know those disposable
gowns in hospitals, the yellow ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: you see everybody wearing all the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll actually take that on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll duct tape that around any orifice of
a tent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't want anything to get in,
and I don't want anything to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's all we can do, then that's all
we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least we're doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then only certain people can go in and
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm only putting something into
my general population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I know I'm not introducing a mite
bomb to the rest of the other moms,
[SPEAKER_00]: because guess what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mothers are the most important,
most valuable thing in any company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if something happens to your
mothers, if we don't quickly, quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: identify, which means you have to train
your staff on what to look for,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then immediately get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it might be the last one of that
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it has a virus or a viroid,
unless you're going to immediately remove
[SPEAKER_00]: it and put it in your tissue culture
facility or to another tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: company, you will spread that disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: You absolutely will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why fuck around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you're going to have to source
another genetic if that's your last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's either that or it's going to be
within probably six months to the next two
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can expect to see a significant
decrease in your yields over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So paying staff to be vigilant about
identifying it, purchasing clean stock
[SPEAKER_00]: from companies that actually can provide a
different type of COA is another thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think is really critical for us all
to become educated and get in a habit of
[SPEAKER_00]: asking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to ask for COAs when it comes
to chemical profiles or compliance for a
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are agriculture laboratories and
companies like you that do this testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And work with companies like mine that
say, OK, I'm doing this process when it
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the test report that shows at least
when I tested it for these particular
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases, it was negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, at that point, can we say
disease free or virus free?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least when it's leaving my hands,
according to the COA, it appears that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: testing negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all need to understand that we
should start asking for that because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to bring anything into my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless I know at least that bare minimum
has been done, especially since I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes spending a hell of a lot of
money for these genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I think and then just it's you've
got to have a sanitation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many good resources about
how to do I.P.M.
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting, why you would want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then consultants like myself and many
other consultants around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We help train your teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We help bring that method in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just a learn curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, yeah, nobody likes to wear
a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I don't think about it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't tell you at the beginning how
many times I'd have to turn around right
[SPEAKER_00]: before I get to the door of the store
because I left the mask in my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will take some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be accepted and practiced
and prioritized from the top down,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if somebody doesn't want to pay
for testing, are you going to throw that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant away of somebody?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if the boss is like,
oh, my God, that's my strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but what do you want me to do with it
as the grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your boss is telling you to keep it
and you have no place to put it,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how these companies are getting
themselves into trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's a few things to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's just the cultural
practices that there's so many great
[SPEAKER_00]: resources out there, companies and
consultants to help you just get over the
[SPEAKER_00]: hump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you and you mentioned masks and sort
of this whole shared pandemic experience
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're all going through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder if if cultivators and growers
will be more aware of potential
[SPEAKER_02]: infestations, whether it be from viruses
or pests or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of because we're all going through
this experience and it's it's been so top
[SPEAKER_02]: of mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe you're already seeing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you seeing that cultivators are being
much more cognizant of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: potential infections?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you the immediate thing that I
have noticed is I don't have to explain as
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get it now that can get virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I started giving these talks,
it really actually took like a year before
[SPEAKER_00]: people would believe, truly believe that
plants can get a virus or a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, oh, my God,
yes, it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that was just because why would
they need to know that before?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so and then the idea of like,
OK, these cultural practices of wearing
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started the industry a little
over five years ago, I was working for a
[SPEAKER_00]: company and they still when they were
doing the pinching, they were still doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that with their thumbnail with no gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, why, why would you do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, having had the
experience of working with with with plant
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases, I mean, it's just I would never
in a million years think to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's because I've gone through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this company hadn't gone through
through that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, everybody, we put PPE stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I do for most of my
consultants is where your PPE stations,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the protective supplies that we need,
like gloves and and and the refills for
[SPEAKER_00]: your your bleach or your work on for your
shares and stuff that it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: killing the virus because you can't use
alcohol little thing for everybody out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is all of those supplies?
[SPEAKER_00]: I call those the PPE stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I have to get up to go get a new
pair of gloves, my God, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it easy for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it easy for everybody just to be able
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have a box of gloves
just at one door on the entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have gloves and gloves of
every size and have stations throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it becomes people will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like they don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just if you if it's not, you know,
you know, planned and actually done in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that's going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people, then, you know, it gets to be
up to a point where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not going to I can't find
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I'm using alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the worst thing we want to do
for virus, because.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike with people, and we can use,
you know, hand sanitizer and alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you saw all that happened with the
data and the literature is that alcohol is
[SPEAKER_00]: not really the most effective thing for
plant viruses or viroids, and that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to use the bleach and other
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have been tested and shown out there
like Birkin that will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to leave that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have it prepped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just make it easy for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since the pandemic, it has been
very easy for these companies to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get it quickly and they understand
mechanical transmission more now than I
[SPEAKER_00]: think anybody would ever want to unless
you do what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's an interesting point about
alcohol not being effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sanitation method, maybe for like a better
term when it comes to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work with a lot of other like
fungal and bacterial microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot more needs to be done to
see what products out there are,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, effective against specific or
particular plant viruses or viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why there's going to be a
different mode of action is because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about different kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at DNA or RNA molecule versus a single
celled organism, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can understand thinking about it
from that approach that different
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals are going to have different
effects on those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, much of the literature out there
looking and at least studying things like
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco mosaic viruses, which is one of
the worst things to get because it's damn
[SPEAKER_00]: near impossible to eradicate even with
plant tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just is persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it will stay in soil or water or I
mean, it'll just stay there as kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: latent particle until it gets into a
favorable environment and then off it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the hop latent viroid,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't quite understand the mechanism of
its duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is it viable for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What environmental parameters can really
kill it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still quite a bit of data out
there to show it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they did some studies in field
trials, this was, gosh, I think back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 80s and over in Germany or the UK,
they were looking at field studies of hop
[SPEAKER_00]: latent viroid and they were studying to
see how they could treat the farm or the
[SPEAKER_00]: fields, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're planting this crop and think
about the hemp farmers, if you're planting
[SPEAKER_00]: seed that came from infected moths with a
hop latent viroid and the probability of
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds being infected is really high,
well, that's gonna be now in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have soil and there's a lot of
marijuana growers out there too,
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors and in the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now your soil is at least infected with
these viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were looking to see what
chemicals and compounds that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: use, but also with the farm equipment,
looking at their blades during harvest and
[SPEAKER_00]: what they needed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really when it comes down to it,
we're still looking at the same thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes down to bleach and a few
other chemicals out there that are on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 10% bleach, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough on the shears, but would you
rather suffer with losing your moms and
[SPEAKER_00]: having to pay a bunch of companies to get
like myself to clean them up or buy
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands and thousands of dollars in new
genetics more frequently than you would
[SPEAKER_00]: like or buy some shears every couple of
months?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to me the business answer there is
pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned that some viruses or
viroids might be difficult to tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things I wanted to ask you
about is I know I'm kind of vaguely
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with the idea of keeping plants
suspended in tissue culture as maybe like
[SPEAKER_02]: a preservation task.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could that be like a feasible strategy to
sort of have a tissue culture of a mom
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of just in case that mom does get
sick, instead of trying to tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: something out, you could sort of create a
new one out of clean stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have many customers that actually do
that because you don't want to keep,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your entire library doesn't need
to be, you know, living in your mother's
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one advantage for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can companies, you know,
when we do plant tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a couple of ways that we can
maintain that stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, with the fires too, or the hurricanes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If something just happens and everything's
gone because well, shit, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that happened this past several
years in this past year in particular is
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you lose everything and because
you're just trying to save yourself and
[SPEAKER_00]: you lose your genetics, what are you going
to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so we do this and this is a service
that we provide where we can do seed
[SPEAKER_00]: banking so we can do that in liquid
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's gene banks, plant gene banks
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do this with liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like you've heard of, you know,
for stem cells and so those kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plant banking is a very common thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just have to do the R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I've spent the last
several years actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fiddling around with in my lab here in
Tempe is to actually work through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we start with kind of known stuff
out in the literature that's worked in
[SPEAKER_00]: other similar plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just start things like,
can we just keep it in like refrigerated
[SPEAKER_00]: like temperatures for a longer period of
time than keeping it on the shelf and
[SPEAKER_00]: having to, you know, actively keep,
you know, subculturing it every couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: months and media drying out and this kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we actually preserve it in liquid
nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call it, you know, cryopreservation
as seed and tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, if you want to have instead
of limiting yourself to the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains in your library based off of
square footage in your mom room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now it's a couple of tubes in a doer
tank or some shelf space in a walk in
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler or with nurseries and companies
like myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that I think those are all
advantages to the industry for for tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is early days for companies
that are doing this tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation is just important to know
they're not going to have all the answers
[SPEAKER_00]: just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they're the good company
should tell you what they've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's still not necessarily done like,
you know, I haven't been in business and
[SPEAKER_00]: been able to pull tissue or seed out,
you know, five years after being preserved
[SPEAKER_00]: in liquid nitrogen and check for
viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but companies should be open to have
that dialogue with anybody who's
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in those services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should, I think, let the industry
know that at least this is a company with
[SPEAKER_00]: some integrity and and we're all going to
give it the best shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and also there's no research out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the hop industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's hops industry associations
where, you know, every all poundage that's
[SPEAKER_00]: sold goes a certain fraction of that goes
into for research and development as an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry to pay for things for studying
all of these viruses and viroids and other
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases and hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so young as an industry,
we have nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these companies like myself who are
out there and are providing these services
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing it all on our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it's going to take a little bit
longer for that, but at least know that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then companies like yours that are
providing services.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use the services all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't necessarily have the
sequencing or being able to do the arrays
[SPEAKER_00]: within my own facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to grow up and one day and be able
to have a lab like that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just all a matter of time and
baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least there's more companies like
ours that are out there providing the
[SPEAKER_00]: services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as consumers of those products and
services, we have to just learn to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: better questions and know what the pros
cons and yet to be determined are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet again, just another example of how
or just another example of sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: value of everyone coming together at an
annual event like a can med to to share
[SPEAKER_02]: what we've learned over the past year and
continue to help each other sort of grow
[SPEAKER_02]: up and move this whole industry forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think maybe that's a good place to
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I've I've kept you long over
the time that I promised I would keep you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: To offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate your patience and and
actually asking you to participate in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I miss being in person, but we still
have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's something for us to be,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All night in the hood.
