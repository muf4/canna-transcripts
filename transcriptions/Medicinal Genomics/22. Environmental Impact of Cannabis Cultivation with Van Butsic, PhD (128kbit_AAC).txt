[SPEAKER_01]: On this episode, we talk with Van Butsik,
the co-director of the Berkeley Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Research Center and Cooperative Extension
Specialist at UC Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cannabis Research Center uses an
interdisciplinary approach to address
[SPEAKER_01]: questions at the intersection of cannabis
policy, the environment, and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: producing communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: At CanMed 2021, Van will participate in
the panel discussion about the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental impacts of cannabis
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our conversation, we discuss why it's
important to better understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation affects the
environment, how cannabis compares to
[SPEAKER_01]: other crops in terms of its environmental
impact, how outdoor cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: affects rivers and streams, the challenge
of collecting data on unpermitted cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: farms, and how easing the permit and
licensure requirements for farmers could
[SPEAKER_01]: lead to better environmental outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with Van,
I'd like to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Seed is a cannabis genetics
company based out of Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're innovators of cannabis cultivation
and breeding techniques and have been
[SPEAKER_01]: locally producing licensed cannabis seeds
since 2008, specializing in high potency,
[SPEAKER_01]: unique breeding lines suitable for both
home and commercial grows.

[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, it wouldn't be the CanMed
Coffee Talk Podcast without some good
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that, we always turn to the hemp
and coffee exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know, hemp coffee is a
healthy, delicious, natural product,
[SPEAKER_01]: rich in trace minerals and nutrients,

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Van
[SPEAKER_01]: Butzik.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Van.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are the co-director of the
Cannabis Research Center at UC Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you could briefly
explain to the listeners, what is the work
[SPEAKER_01]: that you do there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Cannabis Research Center is a group
of interdisciplinary scholars who focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: the intersection of cannabis, cannabis
policy, cannabis producing communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the sort of three most
important parts of our work is one,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're interdisciplinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have natural sciences, people who are
ecologists and freshwater scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have social scientists, we have
anthropologists in our group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have people from the law school in our
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have geographers in our group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have economists in our group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the key things is our
research really tries to take a 360 degree
[SPEAKER_00]: look at cannabis issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second sort of important part of our
group is that we're really focused on sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of the communities that produce cannabis,
the policies that impact cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then broadly how they're all related
to the natural environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're interested in sort of how policy
changes, how farmers act, and then how
[SPEAKER_00]: that output leads to environmental
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're sort of having an issue where
we're not sort of focused on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really focused on the health side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really focused sort of on this
environment and community side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third thing that I think
makes our center unique is we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in being sort of active
participants in the cannabis space insofar
[SPEAKER_00]: as we're interested in our research and
forming policy and public decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to make our research accessible to
the broad public and try to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: our research is useful to the policymakers
and the public as they make decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why do you think it's important to
better understand the environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts of cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's at stake?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a bit of background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started researching cannabis probably
six or seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, we were seeing a lot of
really nice pieces in the popular press
[SPEAKER_00]: about some of the environmental impacts of
outdoor cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my thought as a researcher was,
well, is this really going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we seeing these big impacts?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, when we started digging
into it, what we found was a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: complex story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found, of course, that a lot of the
information was just unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't data about these impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to a large extent, a lot of the work
we've done is just trying to set a
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline of trying to understand what's
actually happening with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the environment, are these effects
something that we need to be focused on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's at stake with cannabis cultivation
and the environment, I think, is two
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, historically, cannabis has been
cultivated in remote areas of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is true in California,
where we have sort of historical
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation spots up in the Inland
Triangle, which are really difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: access.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's actually true internationally as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The areas where cannabis has been grown in
Thailand or other places across the globe
[SPEAKER_00]: are usually in remote areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these remote areas also are oftentimes
of high environmental values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are areas that have a lot of
natural value to us, have not been
[SPEAKER_00]: developed into cities and suburbs yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's sort of this natural
intersection of places where cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: historically been grown and at high
environmental values.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second sort of part to the question of
what's at stake is we think because
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis regulation is sort of starting
from scratch, there's the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: how cannabis is regulated as an
agricultural crop relative to the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment to change how we think about
sort of agricultural regulation broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in California,
the environmental standards to which
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis farmers are held are generally
higher than what we would see for other
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more permanent involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically all organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big question is, well, if we can
figure out how to make the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry successful while meeting these
really high environmental standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: can this be a model that can be expanded
to do all of agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you go about collecting the
data to do your analysis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use, you know, we have a senior
disciplinary team, so we use sort of mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our data collection involves a lot
of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, personally, my work is
basically used, I come from a background
[SPEAKER_00]: of sort of economics and geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first thing I did was I wanted
to know, well, how many cannabis farms are
[SPEAKER_00]: there and where are they at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we used remote sensing data,
high resolution satellite data,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically what you see if you go to Google
Earth and you get the highest resolution
[SPEAKER_00]: data possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used that to identify cannabis
grows throughout different areas of
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of gave us like a spatial
footprint of where these farms were,
[SPEAKER_00]: how big they were, how they were changing
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have, there's starting to be
some pretty good data coming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in California, basically cannabis users
or cannabis producers need to record their
[SPEAKER_00]: water usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting to get a pretty good
idea of how much water cannabis producers
[SPEAKER_00]: are using and where that water is coming
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that sort of data collected as part
of the permitting process in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of other sort of
interesting data pieces that are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out from the permitting process as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, those don't, that data doesn't
cover non-permitted farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to get at non-permitted farms and
what non-permitted farmers are doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done a lot of survey work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done two large surveys of
cannabis farmers, both permitted and
[SPEAKER_00]: unpermitted, focused primarily in
California and a little bit in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna have another survey
kicking off next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically this combination of satellite
data, so collected from satellites,
[SPEAKER_00]: data that we can use we can get from the
permitted industry through sort of records
[SPEAKER_00]: requests to the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third one is sort of asking
growers themselves through surveys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what sort of incentives do you
need to, what sort of incentives do you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to use to encourage some of the
non-permitted people to give up their
[SPEAKER_01]: information?
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that might be a little tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the surveys we've done,
and what I wanna say that we, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been able to get pretty good
participation by non-permitted growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think there's probably a certain
type of non-permitted grower who we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting participation from, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who just has no interest in sort of giving
this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the type of non-permitted
farmer we're getting is someone who,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the economic situation was a little
different, in the permanent market,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if it was a little bit easier to get
permitted, might be interested in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for now is sort of staying on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for a lot of non-permitted
farmers, they feel like they're sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: vilified, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeing sort of this press about
the native impacts of cannabis on the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we usually that is blaming sort of the
non-permitted growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of non-permitted growers
who are using totally environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable production techniques and are
not getting permitted for other reasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: not related to their care for the
environment at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's plenty of growers
who wanna be able to tell that story and
[SPEAKER_00]: want that story told.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's the incentive for
them to do the surveys is if they feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're not being represented fairly,
this is a chance for the data to show what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're actually doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we've sort of set up what the
mission is for your group and how you're
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting data.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you found so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we found a number of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and I'm gonna give a little bit of
plug here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the listeners wanna check out our
website, which is crc.berkeley.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the CRC, the Cannabis Research
Center, crc.berkeley.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something we call our science
briefs, which are basically distilled
[SPEAKER_00]: versions of our peer-reviewed work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have three of them up right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two more that are in production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will give you like a really good
overview of all the research we've done
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to go through the primary
academic work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary academic work is also on our
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome to check that out as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what have we found?
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, I think what we found is that
one, there's a lot of cannabis farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of which are unpermitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is related to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost all of our research thus far has
been California-focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it is related to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, there's a lot of farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the farms are unpermitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably a quarter, maybe are permitted
at this point, probably maybe less.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to put a number on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is that a number of farms or is that
just sort of the percentage of the overall
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of footprint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the number of farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have found is that the farms that
get permitted are on average much larger
[SPEAKER_00]: than the farms that don't get permitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the amount of acreage
that's permitted is certainly higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of farms, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that does make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's much harder to hide a big
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's about hiding and it's
also just about cost, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, the cost to permit a big farm
is not all that different than the cost to
[SPEAKER_00]: permit a small farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have some economies of scale
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different sort of license fees
for different sized farms, but most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost is not actually like the fees you're
paying to the state or the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually the upgrades you have to make
to your facility before it can get
[SPEAKER_00]: permitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those oftentimes are not actually
related to the farm itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good example is in Mendocino and
Humboldt County, where a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: have sort of these long private dirt roads
going back to the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get your permit, the whole road leading
to the farm has to meet certain
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might have to replace three or
four or five culverts along the road
[SPEAKER_00]: before you can get your cannabis permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so replacing those culverts costs the
same amount, whether you're permitting a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter acre or two acres of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's some real economies
of scale in the permitting process for the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I didn't mean to derail you there,
but I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of farms, most of them are
non-permitted, and most of them are still
[SPEAKER_00]: small, relative to other types of
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most farms are still less than an acre
in California, which is still a really
[SPEAKER_00]: small farm space-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the larger farms are still
relatively small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even I think the biggest farms we have are
maybe approaching 30 or 40 acres now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's still a pretty small farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Related to farm size, we see a gradient
basically with smaller farms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northern part of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the farm's getting larger as you
move into the central coast in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California with Santa Barbara sort of
having the most acreage in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: From an environmental perspective,
what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it means that we haven't seen
cannabis become like a dominant land cover
[SPEAKER_00]: type in most parts of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't seen huge amounts of timber
removal from cannabis, although we have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen some.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the water use side, what we found is
that it's really about the timing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water use and not so much the amount of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis seems to use about the same
amount of water as any other agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, two to three acre feet of water per
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conflict, and this is somewhat
California specific, but the conflict
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs because California has grown in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has grown in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, we have drought conditions
every summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, we have a Mediterranean
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We generally don't get any rain from say
May till October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plants require irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same time that of course the
streams and rivers are at their lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: point because there hasn't been any rain
for a number of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a conflict there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found is that this conflict can be
mediated through storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if farmers can store water in the
winter and then use it in the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: that works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's some issues with
storage in so far as it's expensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to have enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have found that it does seem like
some of these water related conflicts can
[SPEAKER_00]: be mitigated through good practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good way to plan and invest in
storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that stood out to me when I was
reading the brief you put together about
[SPEAKER_01]: water usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I imagine from a cultivator
standpoint, the fact that the summers are
[SPEAKER_01]: dry in California is a good thing because
coming from the Northeast and having
[SPEAKER_01]: limited experience with cannabis
cultivation, the hardest part is when you
[SPEAKER_01]: have flowering plants and you get into the
wet and raw part of the year, you have an
[SPEAKER_01]: issue with mold and other unwanted
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just interesting to me that
there's a benefit there, but obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an environmental trade off with
the water usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that's probably right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think there's a lot of benefits
to the climate out here for growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: having this low humidity for especially
the latter part of the season when plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it does line up to exactly when
you don't want to be taking water from the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So storage is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see a lot of people using
groundwater, so using wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some concerns that the wells are,
of course, connected hydrologically
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes to the surface water flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure that if people are using
wells, there's not too many wells on one
[SPEAKER_00]: stream and they're not hydrologically
connected to the surface water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the people are using the wells in the
winter to pump water into storage,
[SPEAKER_00]: which works really nicely as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm curious, how do your findings
change when you kind of look at indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation versus outdoor cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, we haven't done a whole lot with
indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a few reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First is that sort of indoor cultivation,
environmental impacts are more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated by the municipalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, water use, the
municipality is charging a rate for the
[SPEAKER_00]: water use and the cannabis grower is
paying that rate using the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's probably going into a sewer
system where the water is treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not particularly concerned about
the environmental impacts of indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production in the same way we are
outdoor cannabis production, just because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a lot of exposure to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the caveat there is indoor
production can take a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so broadly, if we're interested in
energy use and carbon production and being
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about global warming,
that's an area where sort of the indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: market conflicts with sort of
environmental concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not done a whole lot of research
on that issue, although I do suspect that
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future, making indoor farms as
energy efficient as possible will be
[SPEAKER_00]: something that state and local governments
look at as they try to reduce carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had mentioned that part of your
research has to do with policy and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations and sort of how that impacts
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's been four years since
adult use was approved in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, if at all, has the environmental
impact of cannabis cultivation changed in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last four years?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure we can answer sort of
quantitatively, but I think we can give
[SPEAKER_00]: some qualitative answers to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I think that pretty much any
permitted cannabis farm in California is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have minimal environmental
impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations are set up such that if
you're following the rules and you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get your permits, which means your site
was approved for cannabis production,
[SPEAKER_00]: the odds that you're doing something that
is really environmentally harmful,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, are pretty low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the rules are set up to sort of
prohibit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that way, I think that probably,
you know, cannabis you're buying on the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal market in California that's outdoor
grown or mixed light grown, which is sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we studied, is probably,
you know, I would not worry about its
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental footprint too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of where there's been a where I think
there's a lot less known is because the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental regulation, I mean,
partially because environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations have been so difficult for
many growers to meet, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I said, most farmers are still not
doing it in the permanent, are not growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the permanent market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we don't really know
what the environmental effects of those
[SPEAKER_00]: farms are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're, you know, we're still
trying to quantify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's sort of a balancing act by
the state to try to, on one hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to get people compliant and get
them in the legal market, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, then we can sort of assure that
they're having high environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet if you make the environmental
standards too high and too costly for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to comply, then they're more
willing to stay outside, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not join the permitted industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a fine line that the state's
trying to walk there to both encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance while also maintaining a high
environmental standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of us who aren't cultivators
in California, what are some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: standards?
[SPEAKER_01]: And which ones are sort of the hardest
ones to meet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, basically you need to,
I mean, and I'm not a lawyer, so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: are a cultivator in California,
you know, talk to a consultant or a lawyer
[SPEAKER_00]: before you, you know, say, oh,
this is all I have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, I mean, you need to get a
permit from oftentimes three different
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of state groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need your local permit,
which is from your local government.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're in rural California,
that's usually going to be your county
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the county government will often say,
will often have some type of zone and that
[SPEAKER_00]: will say, okay, you can only grow cannabis
on land that's zoned this way,
[SPEAKER_00]: has this soil type and this slope is
located so far from public land and so far
[SPEAKER_00]: from schools and, you know, all of these
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, basically that sort of first
level of regulation, the zoning regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it so that, you know, you're not
going to curb or permit a farm on land
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not appropriate for agricultural
production, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you meet that first standard,
it basically means you have a parcel that
[SPEAKER_00]: your local municipality has said,
okay, this is set up to successfully grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis without there being too much of
environmental threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually a pretty, you know,
for a lot of farmers, there's still most
[SPEAKER_00]: counties in California do not allow
cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So elder cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's actually really a big
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you oftentimes need to show that you
have a water right, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you have enough water to grow
cannabis before you can get a permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this can be sort of a combination
of dealing with the state water boards,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the Department of Fish and
Wildlife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't understand completely the
minutia of all of the regulations there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but essentially, you know, you need to
show that you have enough water to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis without taking water from streams
at the time of year where it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a good example of,
you know, the difference between cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and other agriculture is, you know,
all of these North Coast farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them have water rights to draw
water from the rivers to irrigate their
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, but they're not allowed to draw
water during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can only draw water from
essentially November until March.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, when they need the water is the
summer, which is, and so that means
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially their water right is only good
to take water out for storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good to actually irrigate
directly on plants where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: most other farmers in California,
they're irrigating in the summer directly
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plants, you know, from the water
right that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, you know, one of those
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need to, you know, when you're
going through and getting your permits,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to have, you know, your roads
need to be up to standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is somewhat disputed and I've
heard lawyers say both things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're doing any production or any
manufacturing or processing on your farm
[SPEAKER_00]: and it becomes sort of a manufacturing
center, then all of a sudden everything in
[SPEAKER_00]: your facility needs to be ADA compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to have an ADA bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have, you know, parking spots
for handicapped people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is all fine, but if we
think of this as all just happening at a
[SPEAKER_00]: small farm out in the woods, you know,
all of a sudden that's a big burden when,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, somebody would normally just let
the person trimming go to the bathroom in
[SPEAKER_00]: their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they have to build the ADA
compliant bathroom to have the trimmer go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the bathroom somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it becomes, it becomes
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, you know, sort of all these
different layers of regulations that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think have made the process both high
performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you meet the standard, I think you
are performing really high, but the bar is
[SPEAKER_00]: also so high that for some growers,
it's just very difficult to figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet the standards and get the permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well now I'm going to put you on the spot
and give you a magic wand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you were in charge and you're
unable to either remove some regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe enact some new ones to really
sort of reduce the environmental impact of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation, what would you,
what would you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think for me it's, it's the main
thing is getting, getting more people into
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we do that probably through
two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we need to have more help for
farmers who are trying to join the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you think of a small cannabis
farmer who's been growing cannabis for 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years in Humboldt County, and they have a
good supply chain on the unregulated
[SPEAKER_00]: market and they can sell it for cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they know what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The incentives to join the regulated
market are not that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and the barriers to get there
are pretty high as far as getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just working through all the
permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if we think about, you know,
not, you know, I don't want to generalize
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis, farmers, but many of the
people who have been active in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in, in, in illicit industry probably
don't have, you know, the networks and
[SPEAKER_00]: connections that make it easy to join the
permitted industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the state can step up in,
in as far as like helping lower those
[SPEAKER_00]: barriers to compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, having some free consulting
for cannabis farmers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: having peer to peer mentoring for cannabis
farmers, having some programs that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, where the state is willing to pay
for some of the costs of, of helping these
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers get into the, the regulated
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing I would do is,
is somehow reduce the barriers to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the state can do that without
lowering their standards through,
[SPEAKER_00]: through supplying, supplying help to the
farmers, you know, to, to work through
[SPEAKER_00]: this process for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second thing is, you know,
eventually there needs to be some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement on the non-regulated farmers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that they don't have the
incentive to stay in the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really tricky question because a
lot of the unregulated farmers are not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing anything environmentally wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we know many of them are
sustainable farmers and they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: making a living, you know, on these small
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we don't want to sort of
bring the hammer down on people at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time without, without some threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of, of enforcement against non-regulated
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to see why a lot of people would
get into the regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the problem, and this is sort
of the elephant in the room that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, policymakers have always
struggled to deal with is the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: California just produces far, far,
far more cannabis than it consumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now there's no way to distribute
cannabis that's legally grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside the state, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't sell our cannabis to Illinois,
even though it's now legal to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically that means that if every
farmer were to join the legal market,
[SPEAKER_00]: there would simply be way too much
cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it's small, the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so eventually there needs to be some
way for cannabis farmers in California to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell their cannabis legally outside of the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federally, that's not possible now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know the minutiae of the
laws, but that's really sort of one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: underlying problems is simply there's an
oversupply of cannabis for how much is
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there needs to be some way for
California farmers to sell outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once there's a legal pathway to do
that, then I think we'll see more farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: get on board and join the regulated
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a really, it's a really
interesting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always find it interesting to think
when cannabis does finally become
[SPEAKER_01]: federally legal and you can sell across
state lines, you know, where is the Napa
[SPEAKER_01]: Valley of cannabis going to crop up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect there'll be quite a bit of
cannabis coming from California,
[SPEAKER_01]: just with the experience of the growers
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, that's really
the, I mean, that's really the long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is some federal legalization in some form
such that farmers in California can export
[SPEAKER_00]: legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that happens, I think we'll
probably see a lot more people get in to
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wrapping up here, I was curious to ask
you sort of how has cannabis cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: if at all, how have the practices changed
over the years and have those changes been
[SPEAKER_01]: better or worse for the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, one thing that I would say is
we still as sort of a research community
[SPEAKER_00]: are just scratching the surface to
understand the cultivation methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think relative to sort of other
agricultural crops, there's just a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity in the way people produce
cannabis and grow cannabis on farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every, I mean, it's one of the
delightful things about working in this
[SPEAKER_00]: area is every cannabis farmer has sort of
their own secret twist, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That they like to do that they think helps
them produce the best cannabis and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whatever little niche ecosystem
they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there's this huge
heterogeneous sort of movement or this big
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of growing methods in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the one thing that we've been
able to sort of quantify a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: through the satellite imagery that we use
is during earlier times in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially during medical cannabis,
you could grow up to 99 plants and feel
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty safe of not having enforcement
actions against you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then, you know, because it was
regulated by the number of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people grew these massive trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, you know, interested in how can
I get the most production from 99 plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way to do that was to just grow
these really, really huge cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new regulations in California are all
based on square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you don't, you can grow as
many plants as you want, but you do it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 10,000 square feet or 20,000
square feet or 5,000 square feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the permit you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the production practices have
changed to much smaller plants and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: packing them in tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing, and so, you know,
we've seen a shift from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of big plants to many,
many more smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and then the other thing that
we've seen is mixed light and double
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping becoming really common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can do some type of light that
you can, in most of California,
[SPEAKER_00]: get two crops a season, and this is
becoming super common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, I don't know if the
majority of farmers are doing it yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but certainly a large percentage of
farmers are now doing more than one crop a
[SPEAKER_00]: year by doing some light manipulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious, are they using autoflow
varieties more often too?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've talked to some growers who
are, but I wouldn't be able to put sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a percentage on that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just, I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the folks up at Oregon CBD,
we've talked to Seth Crawford before,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're really big believers in
autoflower, that that's going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe they're a little too far ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that hasn't caught up quite yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is definitely an interesting
technology and something that,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I mean, if it works, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, it certainly fits that
style of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you mentioned too, some of these
folks have been growing cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: decades and they have their methods that
work and maybe they're not willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: change quite yet too, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely something to be said
for experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, one more thing I wanted to ask
you, are there any new innovations and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivations that have you excited or that
you're particularly interested in?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay if there's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I mean, I've seen some really
cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the, I mean, one of the
neatest things I've seen is there's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually some dry farmers up in Humboldt
County who cultivate with no irrigation at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very specific area where they
have, they're on this like floodplain
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the water table's fairly shallow and
it's this really fine porous soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically plant right into this
porous soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the top of the soil and they
leave it, they make everything bare
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there's no, it's just bare soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically as the soil heats up,
it pulls up water from below and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigates the plant that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some great videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just look up dry farming,
cannabis, Humboldt County, you'll find
[SPEAKER_00]: some great YouTube videos of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it looks totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess that's one, I mean,
that's a technology that's very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: for that area, but it's definitely pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the other thing that, and this is
indoor cultivation, which I'm not expert
[SPEAKER_00]: in at all, but I have had some
conversations with people who have had
[SPEAKER_00]: careers in big agricultural indoor
cultivation systems, growing massive,
[SPEAKER_00]: massive quantities of cucumbers or
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still sort of think that the
technologies used by the average indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis farmer are like far from optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say like relative to the type of
production you might see in another lens
[SPEAKER_00]: for their indoor tomato production or
cucumber production or strawberry
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis still actually has a
long way to go to sort of meet those
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that'll be interesting
to see when these people who aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: experts in cannabis, but are experts in
like super efficient, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor and greenhouse growing,
feel more comfortable jumping into this
[SPEAKER_00]: market, you know, what innovations they
bring with them as far as technology and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a common refrain with a lot of
these conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been having is that there's still a
lot to learn and there's still a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: room for improvement in all facets of the
cannabis industry, which is what makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: so interesting and so exciting for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all right, I think I've kept you then
long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you again for joining us
today and look forward to meeting you out
[SPEAKER_01]: in Pasadena and hearing you talk more
