[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk Podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the Senior Marketing Manager at
Medicinal Genomics and proud member of the
[SPEAKER_00]: team that puts on the CanMed Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hope you've had the chance to
check out the updated canmedevents.com to
[SPEAKER_00]: see a preview of our new location for the
CanMed Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed25 Summit, which will take place
June 17th through 20th at the Wyndham
[SPEAKER_00]: Resort in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be adding more details to the site
in the coming weeks and months,
[SPEAKER_00]: so be sure to sign up for email alerts so
you can get all of those announcements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also added all of the CanMed24
presentation videos to our CanMed archive,
[SPEAKER_00]: so be sure to check those out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Dr. Harold Hahn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harold is Chief Science Officer and
Co-Founder of Vertosa and a pioneer in
[SPEAKER_00]: water-compatible cannabinoid ingredients
for infused products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harold designed the industrial-leading
cannabis emulsions that are widely applied
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis beverage brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also holds 16 patents in emulsion
applications and prior to founding
[SPEAKER_00]: Vertosa, he had led a team that developed
the emulsification oil for Bio-Rad's
[SPEAKER_00]: digital droplet PCR system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harold also publishes a regular series
explaining the science of cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: product makers under the name The Happy
Chemist, a nickname you'll understand
[SPEAKER_00]: after you watch this interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of his recent articles describes the
different factors that contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis beverage potency loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a challenge for beverage brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in regulated markets,
it's common to see a 10 to 15 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in potency compared to label
claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: In unregulated hemp-derived beverages,
it can be even higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss the
difference between cannabis beverages and
[SPEAKER_00]: alcoholic beverages, what happens when
cannabinoids oxidize, how to put THC into
[SPEAKER_00]: water based products using physical and
chemical processes, how every aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: the supply chain can lead to potency loss
in cannabis beverages, which beverage
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients accelerate potency loss,
how packaging conditions can affect
[SPEAKER_00]: scalping and oxidation rates, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Harold, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Vertosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vertosa creates industry-leading active
ingredients for infused product makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their patent-pending nano and micro
emulsions are carefully designed for the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific needs of each customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their pre-suspended aqueous solutions
empower them to create incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenous and stable products while
maximizing bioavailability, clarity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at Vertosa.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without any further ado, please enjoy my
conversation with Dr. Harold Hahn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Harold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm excited to talk with you today
about cannabis beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the fastest growing segments
in the cannabis market, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: without its challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regulators, consumers will often
compare cannabis beverages to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my first question to you is,
is that a fair comparison and how are they
[SPEAKER_00]: different?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because alcohol is what consumer and
regular know for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beverage that is adult use that can
change your mindset, that can be impairing
[SPEAKER_01]: you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And from those aspects, cannabis beverage
are similar to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis beverage, maybe we can just
single say THC beverages, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because CBD beverages have different
impairment issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you compare THC beverages with
alcohol, the main comparison, the main
[SPEAKER_01]: difference are the active compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for one is ethanol, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ethanol is water soluble, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is oil soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the fundamental difference
between the two actives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what actually leads from that is when
ethanol is water soluble, it's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to be incorporated into all kinds
of different beverages, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to dilute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't, the fundamental features
of alcohol is it doesn't stop,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning it doesn't attach to the canliners
or any packaging, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't, it doesn't oxidize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can say, you can save a liquor for
200 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You reopen that and still have the same
content of the liquor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, THC is very easy to
be oxidized, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And oxidation rate is like a constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to work around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also THC, because of the
hydrophobicity, you have to have different
[SPEAKER_01]: technology to get the THC into the
beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through by doing that, due to this
hydrophobicity, the THC will tend to stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: to different packagings or can be
sensitive to heat, sensitive to other
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the cannabis beverage as a
whole subject to more pulmonary loss
[SPEAKER_01]: issues compared to alcohol beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens when these cannabinoids
oxidize?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, fundamentally from the
surface, you lose potency, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from the COA you see that,
okay, potency dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: But deeper down into what really happened
to the cannabinoids, I think more research
[SPEAKER_01]: are needed here.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we know THC, the oxidizing
end results is CBN, but usually we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: see a one-to-one conversion, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you lose one molecule of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually you don't see a formation of one
molecule of CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that indicates some other molecules are
formed along this path, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are those molecules?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, this is where I
strongly advocate for more funding and
[SPEAKER_01]: research, especially as a cannabis
beverage, as a whole category,
[SPEAKER_01]: research on that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is this oxidation a challenge for
other forms of cannabis products beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: beverages?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have heard, you know,
the joints, the flowers, they all oxidize,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes get lost over time,
over the shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think beverage is unique form factor
because for example, our technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: we drive down the droplet size,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To the nanometer size from 200 nanometers
to a thousand nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that formation give a much larger
surface area, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, which is great for the onset purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So consumer can feel the effect much
quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, those enlarged
surface area will have more oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: attacking to the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the oxidation rate between the joints
to a beverages could be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I advocate, you know,
the research should be focusing on its own
[SPEAKER_01]: category, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would really hope, you know,
more university and researchers are open
[SPEAKER_01]: to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and you touched on a great point there
and I'm hoping that you can explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we talked about how cannabinoids,
they are hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to try to put them into a beverage
is challenging, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is that technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you mentioned nano emulsion and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, you know, let's get basic with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how are these products made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about how to put THC into
water-based product, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because THC is always soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are, in my opinion, there are two
main school of thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is chemical modification, one is
physical modification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chemical modification is you change the
structure of THC's chemical structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add some functional groups to make it
water-soluble, to make THC as a sugar or
[SPEAKER_01]: salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has its own challenges of this path
because you are creating a product,
[SPEAKER_01]: a new molecule, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to study the safety and
efficacy of the new molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another route is the physical route,
which is the main application for most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the beverage now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The physical route is, even though THC is
not water-soluble, but you change the form
[SPEAKER_01]: factor of the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, for example, we use nano emulsion
as a subcategory of the emotion category.
[SPEAKER_01]: The emotion can be divided into nano
emotion and micro emotion, the two parts,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are nano emotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not defined by the size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, they are defined by the energy
level, so by how you produce the emotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But either way, the end result is the
emotion process make the THC into billions
[SPEAKER_01]: of smaller droplets and they coat each
droplets with a layer of surfactants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the emulsifier origin,
it can be synthetic, it can be natural
[SPEAKER_01]: derived, it can be organic derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Vertosa, we only use organic derived
emulsifiers, which are safe and widely
[SPEAKER_01]: available to consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's the basic gist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you break the distillate or the
molecules into smaller fragments and then
[SPEAKER_00]: coat it with a more water-soluble
compound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then mix it in and it stays in
suspension and is homogenous?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, we change how THC exists
from a big aggregation of distillate into
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller aggregates of droplets,
which are coated by a layer of
[SPEAKER_01]: surfactants, and surfactants make that
droplets water-compatible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these droplets can flow inside the
liquid beverages freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably a good segue into
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you recently wrote an article on
LinkedIn explaining some of the challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: for this potency loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of kicked it off saying that
you did a poll of your followers to asking
[SPEAKER_00]: what they think is the most important
factor in preventing potency loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seemed like most people thought it
was sort of this emulsion technology or
[SPEAKER_00]: the infusion technology, which is what you
were describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, do you agree with that
assessment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why do you think people think that
that is the most important?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen issues of the downstream
potency issues happening and the root
[SPEAKER_01]: cause could be the emulsion, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also have seen many other areas
along the supply chain of making the kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: When any of the sector has issues or
problems, the accumulated effect is
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing to the end results,
which is potency loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, the infusion tech is very
important because it's complex,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the infusion tech itself needs to
be stable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you put that infusion tech,
the emotion or whatever technology into
[SPEAKER_01]: the beverages, it needs to be stable in
the beverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the self-stability and the beverage
stability are two aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it's hard to assume you have
a stable emotion by itself and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have a stable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we have seen this failure time and
time again, and you have to really assess
[SPEAKER_01]: the two lanes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have a stable emotion,
but also this is the most interesting part
[SPEAKER_01]: and complex part because emotion could be
two to three formulas or four formulas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be a thousand skews.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are having different pHs,
they have different ingredients,
[SPEAKER_01]: heat stability, packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really the wild part of expanding
the emotion into the finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where Virtos actually spent a
lot of time understanding our clients from
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what kind of beverage formulation
they are, what kind of packaging,
[SPEAKER_01]: co-manufacturers, a testing lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you're gonna dive into it,
but that's essentially the whole supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain that could potentially impact the
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, and you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get into kind of the different
parts of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get onto that, I wanted to
ask, so when we're talking about losing
[SPEAKER_00]: potency, how much are we talking about
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is there sort of a standard rate of
potency loss?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask me the standards, for
beverages, there are regular beverages,
[SPEAKER_01]: by states and there are hemp beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you ask by state by state,
there is a 10 to 15% variation from the
[SPEAKER_01]: label claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you ask me about hemp beverages so
far, there is no strict regulation yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which the industry, I know they're
advocating for better regulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: better standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the hemp beverages could have a
huge loss over the shelf life,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The shelf life the brands claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some brands may have not as much lost
over the shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some brands may have a huge loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see this huge difference and we see
there's a big need for the industry to
[SPEAKER_01]: better ourself because consumer love this
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And consumer need this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we don't do a good job to,
if we lose the trust of consumers and they
[SPEAKER_01]: say, okay, all those hemp beverages are
finicky and they don't give me enough
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams on the claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's detrimental to the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where Bercosa as a, we try to
lead the conversation and educate our
[SPEAKER_01]: partners and clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you need to pay attention to all the
details that leads to potency loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just assume you had a good
emotion, you have a good co-manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_01]: then everything's fine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we wanna try to educate
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to imagine with so many
different brands out there and so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different products using so many different
technologies that without sort of that
[SPEAKER_00]: standardization, like you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some consumers might experience a
potency loss with one brand and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: apply that to everyone else where that's
not really the case.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the history will, we're early,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're early in this cannabis beverage
sector and more research are needed,
[SPEAKER_01]: more regulation are needed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm strongly advocate for those to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into the supply chain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll start with, can you tell us
what are sort of the seven parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis beverage supply chain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a book title.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts from the cannabis input,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, CBD, CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: So input, and then goes next step is the
infusion tech, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Either emotion or powder or some other
infusion technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the infusion technology will go
into a formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the beverage base is
formulated, the flavors, all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put emotion into the beverage base,
and then you have to select the packaging,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can, glass, PETs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you figure all that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give all this formula to the
co-manufacturer who produce the beverages
[SPEAKER_01]: for you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And after you produce it, you send to the
lab, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lab will test for the potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final finished product will
go into distribution or retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the main seven steps for the
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start at the beginning with
cannabinoid input.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can that stage sort of affect potency
loss down at the end?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main thing is how easy is the
cannabinoids be oxidized?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know from our early data, we have seen
THC and THCV as the easiest to be oxidized
[SPEAKER_01]: and the quickest, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, CBD and CBG are following,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They are slower, but they still oxidize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBC and CBN are behind that,
right, as the third category.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are much slower, but they do,
even though CBN, you know, is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stable in our theory, but from our early
preliminary study, you know, we have seen
[SPEAKER_01]: CBN get lost in beverage too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we still need answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of what it becomes to, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, what does the oxidation do to
the cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where I hope more research are
needed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC is one of the fastest to oxidize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's inconvenient, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Inconvenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So infusion tech is the next phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we sort of already touched on
that, unless you think that there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about, about how that can sort of
affect the potency loss here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, infusion tech, like I said,
it's a very dual concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: People regard infusion tech as simple,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because producing emotions are relatively
straightforward, but actually it's
[SPEAKER_01]: complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, especially when you put that
ingredients into the products,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That complexity generates through this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now beverage formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about some of the different
components that are going into beverages
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they present different challenges?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, beverage usually has over 90% water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the rest, five to 10%,
you have flavors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have functions, functional groups like
THC or vitamins or electrolytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polyphenols, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have supporting ingredients
like preservatives, pH modulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially those are, in my opinion,
the three main things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how can they sort of affect how
your emotion works or how potency can be
[SPEAKER_00]: lost?
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, I think Vertos has been infusing
over a thousand SKUs on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have been collecting data of the
thousand SKUs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's their density, pH, bricks,
color, taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the profile?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have seen that certain brands,
certain clients, they have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging, same emotion, same
co-manufacture, but they have different
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And strange enough, just that flavor
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will cause a potency difference,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in the beginning of the dosing
or long-term shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is where I think the
industry, the mainstream knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: mainstream talent, because we,
as Vertos, we are small, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole industry is small.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all try to figure this out,
but the complex of the base really need
[SPEAKER_01]: beverage experts to help us understand why
certain ingredients on down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism is impacting the potency loss,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we have to admit we see some
causation, A cause B, but we don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: why this happened, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but my goal is to create a naughty
list of ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Naughty list like if you currently using
our current infusion tech of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe try to avoid those five or six
ingredients in your beverages until we
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out a technology can be compatible
with those ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we are as Vertosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think one of the things I'm proud of
is Dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big German company in the beverage
ingredient space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Vertosa and Dollar have some research
collaboration in this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are really excited about bringing
mainstream players who have years of
[SPEAKER_01]: decades of experience on formulation to
help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a naughty list of ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any, I know you said you're
working on it, but are there any that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know of yet or still doing the research
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of things I can mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electrolytes could be potentially a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polyphenols sometimes could be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some flavors, but those flavors we're
still studying, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the two, you know,
top of our proteins, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: could cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess as a consumer, if we're looking
at beverages and potentially to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase, are there certain ones that
should be avoided or maybe are more prone
[SPEAKER_00]: to maybe a potency loss?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or ones that are kind of more stable?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I don't know the answer because I
would love to know more of the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: feedbacks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're getting there, but I don't
think the whole industry has a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how does consumer like the
flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they like each brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is their determining factor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the flavor, is the effect, you know,
is the onset or something else or the
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would love to see more data
from consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can tell you how we can educate
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I feel like what is encouraging is
consumer now, given the trial from the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp beverages going to the mainstream,
they seem to like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to be desiring for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they want to find something to
replace alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fitting right into that category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could say personally, I've seen more
people sort of moving towards cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: beverages to replace alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say, flavor is certainly one
of the biggest considerations,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's some out there that don't
taste that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And flavor is the first layer of sensory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you buy the cannabis beverage for
an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And flavor is the first layer of effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this generate a joyful experience for
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and if we're looking at alcohol,
too, I mean, that's where a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: base their decisions on alcohol as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do you like red or white wine
or, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just drinking straight ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about beverage formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no, one thing before we move on
from that, I noticed in the in the write
[SPEAKER_00]: up that you were talking about scalping
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scalping is a term used in the beverage
industry for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It describes the process of active
ingredients in the beverages attaching to
[SPEAKER_01]: the packaging, because the packaging
material could be hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lacks oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have oil-like ingredients,
it may stuck to the liner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lose its potency in the liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that process called scalping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a good segue because we're
going to talk about packaging next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe talk about some of the different
liner types that are available and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they can sort of affect those scalping
rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny enough, I just published an article
last Friday talking about can liner types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the can liner is kind of a big
issue for the whole industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have six years ago in California,
nobody's using can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's in glass because all the
infusion technology are not stable in a
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is the first issue where
those have helped the industry solve.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were working with Ball, PPG,
all the big can companies and liner
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We test all their generations of liners
and we summarize, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we improve our formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: We summarize, okay, what formula works in
what liner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so today I think we can confidently
make a 12 months stable beverages with a
[SPEAKER_01]: good emotion in a good liner, a good
combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, when the hemp
beverages brands are going to the market
[SPEAKER_01]: in the very fast speed, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get what they can get, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is understandable as a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes that leads to a neglect of
the quality of the liners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some issues that clients picked
the wrong liners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wrong liners will lead to much
higher potency scalping, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the continuous issues where
COSA is wanting to educate our clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, did I hear correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: That this isn't so much an issue with
glass?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are some of the advantages of
using cans versus glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you don't have the issue with
glass, why don't we see more brands using
[SPEAKER_00]: glass?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the heaviness of the
logistics, shipping and the recyclability,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think those are the two on the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to scalping, one of the
other things that you mentioned was oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: ingress and kind of leading to that
oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is that a factor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, oxygen is kind of the big
enemy for cannabis beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I advocate for our industry to
use beer as a benchmark, because when you
[SPEAKER_01]: make a beer, if you have high oxygen,
the flavor will change dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a very short time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So beer industry has perfected their
practice on lower the DO, dissolve oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: during the production.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we advocate our co-packer of
the cannabis beverage to follow the
[SPEAKER_01]: practice of beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine you have a packaging that has
low oxygen to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the packaging somehow allows oxygen
to come in from its CO or from the body or
[SPEAKER_01]: from anywhere, then it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a low DO to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dissolve oxygen will continue to climb up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our cannabinoids will be
continuously to be oxidized.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we see this potential
issue, especially from PET bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because PET, the whole bottle will allow
oxygen coming in constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not only PET, some glass bottles with,
you know, child resistant cap,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even some caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, with a special lid, right,
may potentially ingress oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are having some research
collaboration with a lab right now to
[SPEAKER_01]: further look into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This seems to be an easy concept to
understand, but actually it's very complex
[SPEAKER_01]: to test because you have to remove the
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to control the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a nearly a year process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now with our testing partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned for this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, and that's an interesting
point because, I mean, at least with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis beverages I've used, yeah,
it's not your standard kind of lid that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would see on a can of Coke or a beer
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of that childproof, tamper-proof
tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can actually lead to more oxygen
ingress, you're saying, potentially?
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about, so just kind of,
I guess, to sum up packaging, it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's two main things that you're
trying to prevent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the scalping of, you know,
sort of the molecules attaching to the
[SPEAKER_00]: liner of the actual packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not actually getting to the
consumer when they consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this oxidation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two sort of main problems
you're trying to solve for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to summarize it, one is physical,
one is chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about beverage
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine in a number of different
ways that that can introduce some
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interestingly, there's a joke that
Mertosa, we don't make beverages,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've worked with a lot of
co-manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not golfers, but we have good
caddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen golfers make mistakes here
and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to level up the whole industry,
Mertosa actually, we drafted a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: beverage manufacturing handbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this handbook is, you know,
a hundred pages long handbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: We include every elements from weighing
the ingredients, introducing the
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients, control the dissolved oxygen,
how to test tank, how to package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the main issue I see is producing
beverage is easy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of companies can make that,
but cannabis beverage is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hybrid between regular beverages
and the pharmaceutical layer, because you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to guarantee each can get 10 to five
milligrams, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and previously the beverage co-mans,
their main belief is, okay, I dropped this
[SPEAKER_01]: bag of ingredients into the tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's homogeneous, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if I make a probiotic drink,
like I claim 10 grams of fiber per can,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's measured that and ensure you each
can get 10 grams of fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight grams of 12 grams, consumer okay
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that fundamentally this concept
needs to change in the operator's head.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are making a pharmaceutical like
beverages, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that leads to the THC is easy to be
changed by oxidation, by scalping and the
[SPEAKER_01]: weighing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the residue of the emotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the details could potentially lead
to a failed product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the handbook really
emphasize on what you should pay attention
[SPEAKER_01]: to and changing the concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a regular beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, and you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It introduces a number of different
variables, because you could develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: great product, but then you have to turn
it over to the manufacturer to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: produce it at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're not paying attention to
those details, it's not gonna be the same
[SPEAKER_00]: quality that you started with,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe this whole industry need
standardization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the main part is the
standardized operation in producing the
[SPEAKER_01]: beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so you touched on something,
homogeneity, which I know kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: dovetails into our next topic of the
testing of the actual product,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can that lead to an issue with potency
loss, the actual testing, the labeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then comparing it to what's actually
in the can at the end of the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the testing lab may have three
categories of issues, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first category is inherent because
nationwide, we don't have a standardized
[SPEAKER_01]: standard material, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you buy different standard materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be just off by purity,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: From batch to batch even.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's inherent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another issue is integrity of the lab,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So some labs give you an inflate potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some lab will pander to your potency claim
on the label, and they know you want five
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I gave you 4.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have heard that happening in multiple
labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's integrity issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another issue is the technology issue
is the, you know, when you infuse over
[SPEAKER_01]: 1000 SKUs, you start to find certain
flavors or ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the beverage may need a special
extraction method, because we're still,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have seen the early sign of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still, you know, completing our
observation here, but we have observed
[SPEAKER_01]: certain ingredients like cream or fat in
the beverages will hold on to the THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: not letting go, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need a, you need to design a new
method, a stronger method to extract the
[SPEAKER_01]: THC from beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see, that actually is, bottom line
is maybe the 1000 SKUs do not need one
[SPEAKER_01]: single method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have to develop three or four
methods to really see, okay, what
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients will follow what extraction
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you do any of that testing
in-house at Bertosa, or do you use third
[SPEAKER_00]: party labs?
[SPEAKER_01]: We use third party labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main reason is we understand how
finicky the data could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even from lab to lab, they have
variations, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, so that's why we trust Iresco in
San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are a FDA certified lab with 80 years
of history of running food samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is at least our anchor of
accuracy and consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We often use Iresco to compare our two
other labs, but there are great labs out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, like Infinite Chemical,
like Cambian Labs in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are good labs over there,
ACT labs, but you know, smeeters,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just mentioning a few that we work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are great, but there are many,
many labs that just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to figure out the supply
chain and I don't blame them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Running a lab is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of, details, a lot of
investment on the dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of training is hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we feel it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with a lot of testing labs and,
you know, definitely feel the challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: that they face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you bring up one of, one that's
constantly coming up is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is being infused into all
different things these days, from
[SPEAKER_00]: beverages to edibles to candies to
topicals and to sort of develop methods to
[SPEAKER_00]: reliably deal with all of those different
matrices is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't mention condiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be a great,
a good sector, a fun sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Condiments, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Infused ketchup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot sauce would be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at the end of the supply chain
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine, you know, storage
conditions, things like that could really
[SPEAKER_00]: cause issues with potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially tied to the relation of
oxidation and oxidation will happen at
[SPEAKER_01]: higher temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and we know that with the climate
change, you know, that in the truck or
[SPEAKER_01]: when the truck going to Florida or Texas,
it's going to be hot in a truck if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not specially made for a cold chain
supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how, how do the impact for a beer or
liquor, it may be different compared to a
[SPEAKER_01]: THC because of the oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature is really an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what temperature is sort of the
ideal range for these beverages?
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, don't go, do not go over 35 to 40
degrees C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's kind of my suggestion
because the reason is Canada and Michigan,
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulators use 40 degrees C as they're
accelerating testing condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want to store your beverages
in accelerated conditions for research
[SPEAKER_01]: studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So try to avoid, try to get lower to 40
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got through the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winding down here, Harold, tell us a
little bit more about Vertosa,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you guys are working on and how
people can learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Vertosa has been in the business for
six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had our sixth anniversary party
last week in our headquarter in Berkeley,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are fortunate to have this
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, oftentimes we ask, we ask
ourself, is this real?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, selling a water compatible
cannabinoids as a business, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is inevitable six years ago and
seeing, but, but also seeing the fruits
[SPEAKER_01]: that we build with our clients and
partners through the supply chain and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing the impact of just kind of beverage
to everybody, every, every consumer in
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is, it's a strong release for us to
experience this, this journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our focus is continue perfecting our
infusion tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are leading the industry, but I have to
admit, we still have a lot to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, in order to find the answers,
I don't think we can go along.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should collaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should find more collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should support more researchers,
even competitors, you know, among this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry, we need to learn from each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to encourage each other and propel
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think any company can work in silo
to have, okay, I own this or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my advocate for, okay,
more researchers, more collaboration
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that aligns perfectly with what
we're trying to do with CanMed is to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring together all the top minds and
cultivation, medicine and science,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, to bring them together,
to learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can push this thing forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we agree it's going to take all of
us working together to, to see the this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Competitors doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe one last question I want to ask
you from a consumer standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're looking for cannabis beverages,
are there certain things that you should
[SPEAKER_00]: be looking for to sort of evaluate maybe
higher quality versus lower quality or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe not so much quality,
but you know, about the things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about here, are there sort of
indicators that we could look for to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay, this is a, this is a good
choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you talk about, if you're evaluating
a alcohol brands beer or lexite beer,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to low dose THC beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beer usually is flavor and packaging,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How, how do you, how does it taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: For cannabis beverage, we discussed
sensory flavor is to still the first,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, category of judgment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I want to advocate to the
consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis beverage has this effect,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The effect actually is what you're paying
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, you're not paying for a good
tasting beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy that from Costco very cheaply,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you are paying for a effect that
alcohol doesn't give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the consumer needs to pay more
attention to, after I drink this,
[SPEAKER_01]: pay attention to how you feel,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the onset?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, initially when can you feel
something and after you feel something,
[SPEAKER_01]: how is that time point to the peak?
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it the ramp, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does the ramp feel like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that apparent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or some, sometimes you lose the ramp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you feel something, but it's
going off, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel something is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is the ramp clear?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when did you peaked, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how long the peak last?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when did you wear off?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think it's a, and it's fun to
do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a, it's a fun to collect and
record.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can compare between different
skills, between different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does the product make you feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's more important than how does
the product taste like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Harold, thanks again for taking
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to put some links in the show
description to some of the resources that
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned, especially that handbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for doing it and hope to see
you down in Puerto Rico next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico.
Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
Thank you very much.
