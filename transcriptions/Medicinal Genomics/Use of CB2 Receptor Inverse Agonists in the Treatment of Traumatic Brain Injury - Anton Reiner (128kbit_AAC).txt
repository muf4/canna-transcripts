[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a basic scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a neuroscientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been interested in brain degeneration
for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've recently become interested in the
utility of cannabinoid-directed drugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the treatment of traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'm going to do my talk a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I can walk around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do my talk a little bit
backwards in case I get run out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with the introduction
of the people involved in the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through all of these,
but just going to say that we couldn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: this research without a big team of
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also without the funding sources,
I will mention Tonya Rex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a focal blast, air pressure blast
model of traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonya first designed the system for use in
ocular blast injury, and I modified it for
[SPEAKER_00]: traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Marcia Honig, my major
collaborator in all of this TBI research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Bob Moore, who made the
compound that I'll be talking about today,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CB2 receptor inverse agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in keeping with this backward idea,
I'm going to give you the summary of what
[SPEAKER_00]: my talk is going to be about, then I'm
actually going to go into the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use the CB2 drug, and we target
microglial activation to treat TBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microglia become activated in traumatic
brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: They perpetuate and exacerbate the harm
that's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by targeting them, we hope to
improve the outcomes from TBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, microglia make a lot of CB2
receptors, as it turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes them easy to target with CB2
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, we use a drug called SMM-189.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll typically call it SMM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a funny category of drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an inverse agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does the opposite of an agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you exactly what that means in a
future slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we use a focal cranial blast model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only a small part of the closed skull,
the shaved head, the skull is closed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the skin is intact, the animal gets
shaved, and we put a high pressure air
[SPEAKER_00]: blast against the side of the animal's
head to produce traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: That results in a lot of functional
outcomes and neuropathological outcomes
[SPEAKER_00]: that resemble what you get in mild
traumatic brain injury in people,
[SPEAKER_00]: including visual, motor, and emotional
deficits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We treat them for two weeks, treat the
animals for two weeks, beginning just
[SPEAKER_00]: after the traumatic brain injury event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that turns out to have a lot of
benefit, because it rescues, greatly
[SPEAKER_00]: improves the outcome, the deficits are
reduced, and the neuron loss and axon
[SPEAKER_00]: injury in the brain is reduced as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have preliminary evidence as well that
semi-daily delivery of the same compound
[SPEAKER_00]: in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease
called the J20 mouse model slows memory
[SPEAKER_00]: loss and helps maintain connectivity
between neurons in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So traumatic brain injury has been in the
news a lot, concussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a variety of reasons, it's been a very
prominent issue in the sports world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Alan Schwartz, a writer for the
New York Times, who wrote a lengthy series
[SPEAKER_00]: of articles in the New York Times about
the dangers of repeated head injury in
[SPEAKER_00]: football and what this can do in the long
term to the players, even when the injury
[SPEAKER_00]: that's repeated is what's called
subconcussive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is now Bennett Amalo, who was
portrayed by Will Smith in the movie
[SPEAKER_00]: Concussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bennett Amalo was the first one to
discover this syndrome in athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He first discovered it by doing an autopsy
on the brain of Mike Webster, this
[SPEAKER_00]: football player here who suffered from
profound dementia later in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that you don't have to
play for 15 years as a center and get
[SPEAKER_00]: repeated headbutts to the people that are
charging at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to wait until you're 50,
60 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also happens in younger players.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Chris Henry, who, because of his
career in football, it would seem,
[SPEAKER_00]: suffered a progressive degenerative brain
disease like Mike Webster that's now
[SPEAKER_00]: called chronic traumatic encephalopathy,
CTE.
[SPEAKER_00]: His symptoms were different.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost control of his emotions and he
died due to an accident brought on by that
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of emotional control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Anne McKee, who's extensively
studied chronic traumatic encephalopathy
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what you get with repeated
concussion, normal brain, and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: a badly shrunken brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the problem doesn't only exist for
athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem also is very prominent in the
military, where soldiers get exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: explosive blasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once, twice, many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if it's only once, they wind up
suffering the consequences of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have mood changes, memory loss,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an issue of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why we ourselves got into the
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the compound we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't say too much about it,
except that, again, it was developed at UT
[SPEAKER_00]: by Bob Moore, Bob Moore Research Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has not a fantastic selectivity for CB2
by ligand binding, but in terms of a
[SPEAKER_00]: functional acidity, it's an assay for CB2
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be highly selective for CB2
receptors, and it acts as an inverse
[SPEAKER_00]: agonist in a cyclic AMP reporter assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from in vitro and in vivo studies,
we know what it does is it converts
[SPEAKER_00]: microglia from this harmful state called
the M1 state, in which they exacerbate the
[SPEAKER_00]: injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: It converts them to another state of
microglia behavior that's more beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: and helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing so, we think that's what's
mediating our benefit with the compound
[SPEAKER_00]: that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty, now this is what inverse
agonism looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an assay called the cyclic AMP
reporter assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: A certain kind of cell line called the hex
cells are transduced with this reporter
[SPEAKER_00]: construct that allows you to see how much
cyclic AMP the cells, the hex cells are
[SPEAKER_00]: making.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also then transduce the cells with
either CB2 or CB1 receptors, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: expose these cultures, different cultures,
to increasing concentrations of this broad
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum of CB1, CB2 receptor agonists,
and you get what you expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should produce a reduction in cyclic
AMP because that's what cannabinoids do
[SPEAKER_00]: when they act with CB1 or CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reduce cyclic AMP production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is normal, but what SMM does,
instead of reducing it or producing no
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, what SMM does is it increases
cyclic AMP, so it does the opposite of
[SPEAKER_00]: agonist, so we call it an inverse agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't do anything, however,
of note at CB1 receptors, so it seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be selective for CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 receptors and therefore
non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've tested it in vitro to
find out how it acts, and this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason I got into the TBI research,
because it has a sort of anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did here now is we have primary
human microglia cells in a dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is we expose them to a
stimulant called lipopolysaccharide LPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that stimulant does is it converts
them to the M1 state in which they express
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of chemicals called cytokines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all these cases, you see the
cytokines going up with LPS production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means these microglia now have been
converted to the harmful inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what our drug SMM does,
in all cases, it reduces the expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: this harmful stuff and is combating the
inflammatory state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can also look at other markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When microglia go into the harmful M1
state, they increase expression of various
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins on their cell surface called
CD11B, CD45, CD68.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are three different cell surface
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all go up with lipopolysaccharide
stimulation, and in all cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you expose to SMM, those go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have additional studies I don't
have time to show you in which we looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at cell surface markers characteristic of
M2 microglia in vivo and in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those go up, so M2 markers go up,
M1 markers go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is now the mouse model of TBI that
I just want to walk you through so you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take the mouse, we anesthetize the
mouse, and this mouse is knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shave the left side of its head,
and we put a little white dot over the
[SPEAKER_00]: shaved area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our targeting spot for the blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mouse then goes into this sled with
sort of a foam cushion insert there where
[SPEAKER_00]: its head gets cushioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very tight fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into a very tight tube,
and so he's very snug in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he's cushioned as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tube with this big tube centimeter
opening, this tube goes into this wider
[SPEAKER_00]: tube here, and this wider tube is this one
here, and it has a 7.5 millimeter opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 7.5 millimeter opening, we center the
mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the white dot centered in front
of there, and then we center this
[SPEAKER_00]: contraption in front of this, which is a
paintball gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been modified to put out a higher
pressure blast, and we bring the mouse a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple millimeters away from the barrel of
the paintball gun, and we fire it once,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the mouse winds up then showing a lot
of different kinds of symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the blast area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It encompasses the entire forebrain of the
mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the forebrain behind there in
silhouette if you know any mouse brain
[SPEAKER_00]: anatomy, and this is the family of the
mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the blast levels that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the peak for different blasts that
we use and the duration of each of those
[SPEAKER_00]: peak blast pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we want to model mild traumatic brain
injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a single blast, and even mild
traumatic brain injury in people has
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the characteristics of mild
traumatic brain injury in people is if a
[SPEAKER_00]: physician does an MRI of the brain,
somehow visualizes it, the brain looks
[SPEAKER_00]: just fine, and the physician is inclined
to say, like, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's underlying that, though,
is that the forces of the blast or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the impact was that caused the
concussion have wiggled and disrupted the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain and caused stretching compressive
injury throughout the brain, and a
[SPEAKER_00]: manifestation of that will be axons will
be injured and will break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what broken axons look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what broken axons look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these axons here in the brain of humans
who have suffered a concussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortly after concussion, they died,
but this is what broken axons look like
[SPEAKER_00]: even in a mild traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are labeled for different kinds of
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what they are,
but what happens is the axon should be
[SPEAKER_00]: this long, smooth thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, you see these beads on a string
kind of phenomena with the axon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those axons are damaged, and what's
happened to them is axons normally look
[SPEAKER_00]: like this schematically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have inside them things called
microtubules that they use to transport
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins back and forth between the neuron
cell body and the terminal, then from the
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal back to the cell body.
[SPEAKER_00]: When axons get stretched, those,
oops, I'm never going to stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, they break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They break in these different spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're transporting stuff,
so it's like breaking a hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fluid or the proteins that are
collecting at those spots now can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: transported anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is they pile up, and so those
parts of the axon swell, and then they can
[SPEAKER_00]: even break, and the axon's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we see that in our animal model,
which verifies that it is a model of mild
[SPEAKER_00]: traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we blast on the left side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the optic tract that I'm going to
be showing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to focus on this because
this is a schematic of the optic tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: The left eye here, which is the side we
blast from, this is the left optic nerve,
[SPEAKER_00]: which at the level of the optic chiasm
mixes together with the optic nerve from
[SPEAKER_00]: the right eye, mixed together,
and then what happens is, in mice at
[SPEAKER_00]: least, most of the left optic nerve
continues as the right optic tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important point is I'm showing you the
right optic tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the right optic tract here,
we've stained the axons now in these
[SPEAKER_00]: brown, straight, but wiggly things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are normal axons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice there's no bumps in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the marker we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look after three days after TBI,
you see that we have some nice smooth
[SPEAKER_00]: axons as well, but we have these dark
bumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The axons are broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're torn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a different marker now for
visualizing those axons as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't visualize as many, but this is
a mouse engineered, so some of the axons
[SPEAKER_00]: express this fluorescent protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, in this case, seven days after
TBI, you can see broken axons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can look throughout the brain and we
see these broken axons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to check my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got seven minutes left.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important point of note is that here in
the optic tract here, here are microglia.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cells you can barely see are the
microglia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fine looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wispy, slender.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after TBI in the optic tract,
when they're surrounded by all these
[SPEAKER_00]: damaged axons, the microglia go into
destroy and remove mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they shrivel up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They extend these thick, chunky processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're in the M1 state now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move it along here and not
talk about these other slides here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we then start to look at functional
deficits after TBI and the benefit of our
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next series of slides are going to
show you deficits and functional benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug being a CB2 receptor inverse
agonist, this thing called SMM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So visual acuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually measure visual acuity in
a mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tests for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we normalize to 100% as normal in
the animals that got no blast injury and
[SPEAKER_00]: got vehicle instead of drug, we call that
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see then for the left eye,
those animals are down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their acuity is reduced by about 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a significant reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the animals that we gave drug to after
blast, there is a significant improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their acuity is significantly better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another visual thing that we look
at called contrast sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important in human vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's improved as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look to see what's the
underlying basis of this deficit and the
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement with drug, we find that the
retina is about 10% thinner after the
[SPEAKER_00]: blast injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that thinness is much alleviated by
drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the inner retina, there's
especially a lot of thinning that goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inner retina is the part of the retina
that has the retinal ganglion cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we also look at motor function.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take you through some of this and just
make the overall point, I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on this particular illustration so I
can get through the rest of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so this is a spinning rod task.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put a mouse on a spinning rod,
a rod that increases its spin rate second
[SPEAKER_00]: by second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mice kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a challenge for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normal mice, if you test them before
blast, you know, normalize that to 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: and then test them the day after blast,
one week, and two weeks after blast,
[SPEAKER_00]: they progressively get better at the
spinning rod task.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the task is to stay on the rod and not
fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get better at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the animals, however, that have
received TBI, they don't do as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: animals that received a sham blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the animals with drug,
they do a whole lot better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: blasted animals alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So underlying this, we found that there is
a rescue of some of the motor structures
[SPEAKER_00]: of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are other functional tests of
motor function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we put the animals in arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run around fast or slow, depending on
who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line here is that after
TBI, animals run around more slowly,
[SPEAKER_00]: drug fixes, after TBI, animals have
trouble navigating turns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the drugs, this is the difficulty
there, and the drug seems to improve their
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to navigate turns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also measure depression in a mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't bother with saying how we do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get to the bottom line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure depression over a five-minute
period in our test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test is called a tail suspension test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that this red line here is higher
than the blue line indicates the animals
[SPEAKER_00]: with blast are depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the green, the drug
normalizes the animals in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also look at fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to see how I'm doing on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I can slow it down a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also can look at fear in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important thing for the
PTSD-like outcome from TBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we put a mouse in a
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mouse is sitting in the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sniffs around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He explores the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's relaxed about being in the
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he hears a tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hears the tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the tone's not very disturbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of innocuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then at the end of the tone,
there's a very mild shock that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: hurtful, but is nonetheless a shock you
wouldn't want to experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that happens five times now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is the mouse becomes
afraid when he hears the tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shows a mouse fear behavior called
freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after five trials of training,
the next day we bring the mouse back in
[SPEAKER_00]: and we test to see how well he remembers
the fear, how fearful he is in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: either the context alone, or the tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in response to the context alone,
mice actually generalize the fear to the
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber where they got shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The animals that got blast, injury,
TBI, but no drug, just vehicle,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are more fearful of just being in the
chamber over the first 30 seconds of the
[SPEAKER_00]: test and somewhat reduces over the second
30 seconds of the contextual fear
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we play the tone all by itself
with no further shocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look to see how the animal responds to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that 12 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over the course of 12 repetitions
of this, what's called the CS,
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditioned stimulus, the animal
initially shows fear if it's a non-blasted
[SPEAKER_00]: animal receiving vehicle, and eventually
stops showing any significant fear
[SPEAKER_00]: altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: The animals that got blast show a lot of
fear that does not extinguish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The animals that got drug show
intermediate fear, but they do extinguish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this drug has alleviated the
fearfulness after TBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the part of the brain that's
responsible for regulating fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the basolateral amygdala.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the left basolateral amygdala.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basolateral amygdala in people too,
we assume, but certainly in mice contains
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons that are fear increasing and fear
reducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an engineered mouse where the
anti-fear neurons are visualized with this
[SPEAKER_00]: green fluorescent compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it turns out, we serendipitously
discovered that after TBI, the anti-fear
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons were reduced and abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like blast kills the anti-fear
neurons, so therefore the animals are more
[SPEAKER_00]: fearful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our drug, however, rescued many of the
anti-fear neurons, and so fear was
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've also looked at
electrophysiology to see how well brain
[SPEAKER_00]: connectivity is maintained after our drug
is given after TBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this complicated looking thing here is
showing a communication between the
[SPEAKER_00]: hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is showing you a sort of a simulation
of a memory transfer system between two
[SPEAKER_00]: brain regions important in memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The noteworthy thing is that when there is
a moment of firing activity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hippocampus, there is in a normal animal a
co-occurring moment of activity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: prefrontal cortex, and that's what that
blue peak shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: After TBI, that's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prefrontal cortex does not follow the
firing activity in the hippocampus.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the drug, however, that is restored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found that the drug also was
beneficial in terms of this
[SPEAKER_00]: electrophysiological readout of brain
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, now switching gears, I'm going to
tell you very briefly about the work we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing in Alzheimer's disease and
Alzheimer's disease model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we treat the animals for about two
months every other day with this compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lower dose than we use for TBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have been looking at a number
of parameters, memory parameters as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as electrophysiology parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It improves memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mice show less memory loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also shows where connectivity is
improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this complicated electrophysiology
thing is again showing you activity linked
[SPEAKER_00]: between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's high here, that means there's
linkage of activity when hippocampus
[SPEAKER_00]: fires, prefrontal cortex fires at
different frequencies here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at different frequency bands
for where the matching occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a normal J20 mouse, which is
somewhat of an oxymoron, it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's model, so it's not really a
normal mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a typical J20 mouse that has
disease but no drug benefit, there's very
[SPEAKER_00]: poor communication between these two brain
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems in Alzheimer's is that
synapses are lost and brain areas don't
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with drug, that connectivity is
apparently maintained because
[SPEAKER_00]: functionally, the prefrontal cortex is
following hippocampus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made it through everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you.
Thank you.
