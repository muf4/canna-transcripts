[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_02]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I have some great news to
report at the top here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The recordings of all the CanMed 2022
presentations and panel discussions have
[SPEAKER_02]: been added to the CanMed archive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Head over to canmedevents.com to check out
more than 20 hours of new content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we did the math.
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're at canmedevents.com,
be sure to sign up for email alerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said last episode, we're working hard
behind the scenes, getting ready to
[SPEAKER_02]: announce details around our CanMed 23
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: The higher ups won't let me give away too
many details, but trust me, this is an
[SPEAKER_02]: event you won't want to miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're signed up for email alerts,
you will be among the first to receive
[SPEAKER_02]: word.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Heather Grabb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heather is a senior lecturer at Cornell
University's School of Integrated Plant
[SPEAKER_02]: Science, where she delivers best practices
for the cultivation and processing of hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: to professionals in Cornell's Hemp Science
MPS program.
[SPEAKER_02]: She works with plant breeders,
pathologists, biochemists, extension
[SPEAKER_02]: professionals, regulatory officials,
and industry partners in New York State
[SPEAKER_02]: and across the globe to translate the
latest science and industry insights into
[SPEAKER_02]: a curriculum that covers hemp from soil to
sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it should come as no surprise that our
conversation covered a wide range of
[SPEAKER_02]: topics related to hemp cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those topics include how Heather got
involved in studying hemp, an overview of
[SPEAKER_02]: the Cornell University Hemp Research
Program, Heather's research into
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated pest management in hemp,
in particular, finding out which pests are
[SPEAKER_02]: most harmful to outdoor hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also talk about the wide variety of
hemp varieties that Cornell grows in their
[SPEAKER_02]: field trials and how they prevent male
fiber crops from pollinating the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid-rich plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We discuss what is preventing hemp from
displacing other legacy crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: how pollinators, specifically bees,
interact with hemp plants, how frost and
[SPEAKER_02]: other stresses affect cannabinoid levels,
and much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I get to my conversation with
Heather, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, Conception Nurseries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Conception Nurseries, the world's largest
micropropagation lab, brings proven
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural technology to cannabis with
tissue culture technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: To date, cannabis cultivators have been
dependent on mother plants to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: clones, resulting in inconsistent harvests
with diluted and uncontrollable traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue culture technology, which is widely
used in industrial agriculture to address
[SPEAKER_02]: the exact problems cannabis cultivators
face today, allows Conception to quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: mass-produce identical, disease-free
plantlets with customized and consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: For more information, visit Conception
Nurseries dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Heather Grab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Heather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm excited to talk with you today
about hemp science and specifically about
[SPEAKER_02]: the work you're involved with at Cornell
University, which is one of the leading
[SPEAKER_02]: academic institutions in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: here studying the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, I was hoping you could tell the
audience a bit about yourself and how you
[SPEAKER_02]: got involved with hemp research and how
you ended up at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to give a brief intro to myself and
then to talk a little bit more about our
[SPEAKER_01]: program here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: My academic background is actually in
entomology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the study of insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a lot of work with small farms in
the region for my PhD focused on crop
[SPEAKER_01]: protection and developing integrated pest
management solutions that would also be
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial for crops that rely on other
insects for services, including pest
[SPEAKER_01]: control and biological control,
which greenhouse growers can rely on to
[SPEAKER_01]: help suppress their pest populations,
but pollinators as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a lot of work with wild pollinator
populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is actually, interestingly,
what got me interested academically in
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we first started producing
industrial hemp here in New York state,
[SPEAKER_01]: our team leader, Dr. Larry Smart,
was fielding a lot of calls from our
[SPEAKER_01]: grower collaborators in that very first
year or two asking why we were seeing so
[SPEAKER_01]: many bees in their fiber and grain and
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as somebody who is an entomologist with
a strong interest in bees, he sent me an
[SPEAKER_01]: email and I was like, great, I would love
to get out there to hemp fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a student who was working with me
that summer, Nate Flicker, on his senior
[SPEAKER_01]: thesis project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made that sort of what his focus
was for the rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went out and surveyed the
pollinator communities on industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: to see what the bees were doing out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after sort of getting that experience
in the field with hemp, there was an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity for me to join our hemp team
here full time to teach and mentor
[SPEAKER_01]: students in our professional master's
degree program that has a whole ability
[SPEAKER_01]: for students to focus on a hemp and
cannabis track within that degree program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I left for that opportunity,
which is how I joined our broader hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: team here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's truly a privilege to be part of this
community at Cornell that includes
[SPEAKER_01]: academics like myself who focus on
teaching, communicating, doing research,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as extension educators who are
sort of this interface with the grower
[SPEAKER_01]: community and the state to help solve
problems that they have and to build the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit of the overview of
myself and the broad research and
[SPEAKER_01]: education program that we have here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do want to get into some more detail
about the work that you've done with the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinators in hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we do that, I do want to talk a
bit about the program at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if you could give a
little more detail in terms of what does
[SPEAKER_02]: the program cover and kind of what makes
it unique from other programs that are
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you asked that, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a broad array of different
educational opportunities in hemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recognize that there's a ton of
interest in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to help support and build the
industry by providing knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: helping companies and individuals to
answer questions that they might have,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they're interested in starting a
new business in the hemp space or if they
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to know more about the plant as
a consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a huge range of options.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, there's sort of the
traditional student option for
[SPEAKER_01]: undergraduates where they are already
going to be participating in the College
[SPEAKER_01]: of Ag and Life Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an undergraduate student, they can take
many of the courses that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also began offering a few years ago
this specialized track that focuses on
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and cannabis in our professional
master's degree program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we developed a suite of five different
courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're considering many new ones all the
time, but we have a broad industry
[SPEAKER_01]: overview course called Cannabis Biology
Society Industry that draws from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Law school students, business school
students, hospitality students,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course ag sciences and biology students
take that class.
[SPEAKER_01]: I teach a course on production systems
also in the fall semester that covers
[SPEAKER_01]: everything from cultivar selection and
site selection all the way through all of
[SPEAKER_01]: those cultivation practices that students
need to know about propagation,
[SPEAKER_01]: how you treat plants in the field,
whether you're going to make decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: about pruning and trellising your plants,
harvest timing choices, planting density,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is critical for industrial hemp
cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have courses in the spring semester
that focus on the processing of industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have classes that focus on
breeding and genetics of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, of course, on the pharmacology
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how the compounds within the plant
interact with our own unique biology and
[SPEAKER_01]: that of other organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So including things like veterinary
applications of some of these hemp derived
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So huge suite of different classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, one thing that I'm really
excited about is that we are now beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: to offer some of these classes in an
online format.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two options that I talked about
before, those are degree granting
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either a traditional bachelor's degree
where you might take a series of courses
[SPEAKER_01]: and concentrate in hemp for your
undergraduate studies or our professional
[SPEAKER_01]: master's degree program where you're
focusing on these classes and then
[SPEAKER_01]: building your own independent project,
often with our industry partners to solve
[SPEAKER_01]: a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also beginning to offer these
classes online in a partnership with E
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we already have Dr. Larry Smart's Hemp
Breeding and Genetics class that's
[SPEAKER_01]: launched on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hemp production system and my hemp
processing courses will be the next to go
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working really closely with our
industry partners to hear what they think
[SPEAKER_01]: are the most critical skills and areas
where we can provide education So those
[SPEAKER_01]: might be things like analytical lab
skills, which is incredibly important for
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry or integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might develop future classes that
focus specifically on those topics in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's interesting you mentioned
integrated pest management and it stuck
[SPEAKER_02]: out to me too when you were kind of
talking about your background as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's something we're seeing at
least on our side with medicinal genomics
[SPEAKER_02]: pop up more because obviously we're
involved in the microbial testing of sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of the end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that's coming online
is irradiation, which we're finding has
[SPEAKER_02]: all sorts of different issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the alternatives to remediating
your product that's contaminated is sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of preventing that on the front end,
which as I understand it, IPM can really
[SPEAKER_02]: help with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much work have you done with IPM on
hemp and what are some of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: you've learned?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have actually a grant right now with my
colleague Marion Zufo from New York State
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually have this broad IPM program
that's supported by the state and housed
[SPEAKER_01]: at Cornell University to establish what's
called a crop profile for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the foundational material that
IPM practitioners would be able to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand crop schedules, cultivars
that are used, what kind of production
[SPEAKER_01]: practices are cultivators using in the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really importantly, at this early
stage of development in the industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and in the outdoor production to also
see what pests are going to be most
[SPEAKER_01]: critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have a relatively good idea of
what pests are most causing issues in
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and indoor production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we cultivate more hemp,
outdoors, especially grain and fiber hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: learning what those issues will be and
trying to be aware of the broad array of
[SPEAKER_01]: different issues that can occur across the
full life stage of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things that attack those early
germinating seeds out in the field,
[SPEAKER_01]: like pythium, for example, or head blights
that can cause the buildup of mycotoxins
[SPEAKER_01]: in grain production and what regions of
the country are those likely to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even issues like pests of birds,
for example, and maybe eating grain that
[SPEAKER_01]: surprisingly is a very large issue here in
many of the research farms that we work
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's farms that we just don't plant on
because the bird pressure is so high that
[SPEAKER_01]: we lose a substantial portion of our grain
crop to birds every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just understanding what the landscape
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a project that we have funded
that will hopefully complete over the next
[SPEAKER_01]: year with the help of some of our
professional master students who might
[SPEAKER_01]: take on a portion of that as their
capstone project that they complete in the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of their degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when you finish that project,
I look forward to having you back on to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know one of the other things that you
guys do, and I saw that you just posted
[SPEAKER_02]: about this, it was either this week or
last week, is you have a field day where
[SPEAKER_02]: you sort of present all the field trials
and things that you guys have been working
[SPEAKER_02]: on throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a bit about that and what do you
have planned for 2022?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my colleague, Dr. Daniella Vergara is
taking the lead on organizing our field
[SPEAKER_01]: day this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of one of the main feature
days where we highlight the research and
[SPEAKER_01]: the work that we're doing as a hemp team
here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think one of the things that makes
our entire team unique is that we have so
[SPEAKER_01]: many different experts from across a broad
range of disciplines who are all
[SPEAKER_01]: leveraging their unique insights,
skills, and connections with their
[SPEAKER_01]: industry partners to help us build
solutions that are really right at the
[SPEAKER_01]: point where growers need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having the opportunity for growers to
come out and actually see what we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the field is so critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Daniella, and her colleagues in Cornell
Cooperative Extension have been doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: great job of putting together a schedule
of speakers for that event that will
[SPEAKER_01]: include pathologists who will talk about
the kinds of diseases and issues that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing in the field across multiple
different market classes, whether that's
[SPEAKER_01]: grain, fiber, or high cannabinoid hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have, of course, Marion and myself
there talking about insects, issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have our breeders there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Graduate students are frequently also
presenting some of the projects that they
[SPEAKER_01]: are working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a personal highlight for me is
always seeing our cultivar trials out
[SPEAKER_01]: there in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nowhere else I think you can go
where you can see as many different
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars of hemp being grown in one
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a huge array of different
cultivars that we include in our high
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid outdoor trials, but also grain
and fiber cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this year, as long as the
weather cooperates with us, we will have
[SPEAKER_01]: some demonstrations on harvesting fiber
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about some important processes
that are enacted by beneficial microbes in
[SPEAKER_01]: the process of redding fiber hemp out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really get to see that full
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome to touch the plants to get
out there, to smell them, to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing in the field on this field
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great, it's a really great
experience for those who can make it to
[SPEAKER_01]: our AgriTech campus in Geneva,
New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is the primary audience for that
event, like growers, like maybe folks who
[SPEAKER_02]: are looking to get into the industry and
are trying to learn as much as possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly encourage growers to come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course we try to think about things
that are most relevant for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's a great place also for
processors to be so they can understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what some of the issues are that growers
are seeing on the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, your fiber hemp processor,
it's beneficial for you to be there so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can understand and help to guide
the partners that you're working with on
[SPEAKER_01]: the production side, things like cultivar
choice or harvest timing or post harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: issues that they might encounter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same is true for the high cannabinoid
market as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great for them to get out there,
see what those plants look like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field and our cultivar trials,
what kind of practices you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: before, some issues with microbial
contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the things that we can do in
terms of biological controls that may be
[SPEAKER_01]: really helpful in preventing issues like
botrytis or powdery mildew that can occur
[SPEAKER_01]: either in the green house or in the field?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how might some of the applications of
those crop protection materials influence
[SPEAKER_01]: downstream processing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year we had great attendance by folks
who are on the analytical side as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually also bring in regulators who
can help us to understand the current
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory landscape, which is always sort
of in flux, it seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always new changes that are
happening at the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: DA level or the state level within our
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making sure that we're really actively
communicating all of the different reports
[SPEAKER_01]: that growers need to be processing and
thinking about all the licenses that they
[SPEAKER_01]: need to acquire to be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you mentioned this this huge array
of different cultivars and some being
[SPEAKER_02]: grown for cannabinoid, some being grown
for fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is sort of the mix there in terms of
the focus of the research there at your
[SPEAKER_02]: program, though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it primarily focused on the
cannabinoids or is it fiber?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know at least when you look at a
lot of the folks who are growing it
[SPEAKER_02]: commercially, it tends to be a lot of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say that's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New York state, our production has very
much been dominated by high cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp in terms of overall market value,
acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the markers you would look at,
of course, cannabinoid hemp has been
[SPEAKER_01]: dominated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has been a feature of our
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have a lot of research on the
ground to help support the development of
[SPEAKER_01]: the industrial hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say we have a fairly even
distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, there's, you know,
I mentioned before, we have this broad
[SPEAKER_01]: range of expertise within our program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Neil Mattson, who leads our
controlled environment agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: program, so focuses mostly on greenhouse
and indoor cultivation strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, his lab has been focused almost
entirely on high cannabinoid hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little bit of baby leaf hemp
that went on in indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some interest in these specialty niche
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say we're very much interested
in exploring and supporting all aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we mentioned that a lot
of the commercial environment is really
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have to ask this for any time I
talk to anyone who's focused specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: on hemp is, you know, why do you think
hemp really hasn't lived up to this this
[SPEAKER_02]: promise of it being a super crop that's
going to replace all these other legacy
[SPEAKER_02]: crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we we do hear a lot of hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like things change all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it is that we're excited about the
crop, whether it's carbon sequestration or
[SPEAKER_01]: replacing other crops that might have a
higher level of environmental impact
[SPEAKER_01]: through pesticide use or through use of
limited water resources in some regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think hemp is beginning to make
inroads in many of these areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But making sure that all of those pieces
of the supply chain can come together in a
[SPEAKER_01]: coordinated fashion is a major barrier to
the development of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of where extension
services and where academia can help to
[SPEAKER_01]: come in and to support some of the
creation of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, you know, speaking with
our industry partners who work in food
[SPEAKER_01]: applications, they're really excited about
using hemp proteins as an alternative to
[SPEAKER_01]: animal based proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even to other plant based options.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, almonds and cashews,
which are frequently used in these plant
[SPEAKER_01]: based alternatives, don't necessarily have
the greatest profile in terms of either
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability or their social equity
impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having hemp as an alternative is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we have to build the knowledge
for how to process and how to handle those
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, you know, of course, we don't
want to drink a hemp milk or have a hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: ice cream that tastes exactly like you're
eating hemp hearts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to taste like the chocolate
flavor or the coffee profile that is
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for other proteins, we have a lot of
knowledge about how to incorporate those
[SPEAKER_01]: into food products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have food scientists here who are
working really closely with our plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders to help to develop cultivars that
can meet those specific needs for the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same is true when it comes to industrial
fiber applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a big issue in grain, which I'm
sure other podcast interviewees have
[SPEAKER_01]: probably mentioned, is the ability to use
grain in animal feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the opportunity for that crop or some
of the byproducts that come from grain to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to be incorporated for poultry or
for other uses is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, growers who are not able to
market their crop into the human food
[SPEAKER_01]: market for whatever reason, don't have any
other option for where to offload that
[SPEAKER_01]: crop in order to perhaps recover some of
the investment that they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a soybean grower and you had
planned to have some of your product used
[SPEAKER_01]: for soybean oil for human consumption,
but for whatever reason, you're not able
[SPEAKER_01]: to make it into that market space,
of course you have the options to offload
[SPEAKER_01]: that product in a number of other markets
that we don't have developed yet for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good news is there's many different
academic institutions and industry groups
[SPEAKER_01]: that are working to develop those
different supply sources right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we will see hemp develop as a
crop, but slow and steady will win the
[SPEAKER_01]: race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having this integrated across the
board knowledge base, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: developing the right cultivars for the
right end uses or the right climates,
[SPEAKER_01]: having food scientists who are really
familiar with the attributes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: qualities of these products all the way
through the supply chain, that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess that makes a lot of sense
that, you know, the cannabinoid sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: supply chain or processing chain,
like that's pretty well established.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in order to sort of unseat some of
these other crops that have had decades of
[SPEAKER_02]: refinement and optimization, it's
definitely going to take some time in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I mean, from what limited
knowledge I have, as I understand it,
[SPEAKER_02]: just the actual processing equipment and
the availability of that is somewhat of a
[SPEAKER_02]: barrier as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in getting ready for this podcast,
I did see that Colorado they just had a
[SPEAKER_02]: proposal up there to use five million
dollars of their cannabis tax collection
[SPEAKER_02]: funds to buy processing equipment for that
reason, too, to sort of help support hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: growers in that state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, that got quashed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much of a barrier is sort of just
processing equipment or processing
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Processing facilities are a big challenge
in terms of developing the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bit of a chicken and egg
issue that we have in developing,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially the fiber side of the
industrial hemp market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for grain, there's a whole lot of
infrastructure out there that's fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to adapt to handle oil seed crops
like hemp grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's some unique issues with
incorporating those into food products
[SPEAKER_01]: that I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with fiber hemp, it's really about
these very large capital investments in
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five million dollars is really a drop
in the bucket when we think about what it
[SPEAKER_01]: costs to establish even one of these
processing facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are fortunate in that there are many
companies who have already been gaining
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with fiber hemp processing,
mostly in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of equipment that was
traditionally used to process flax in
[SPEAKER_01]: northern Europe can be fairly easily
adapted to handle fiber hemp as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, of course, France has been
cultivating fiber hemp in Germany on a
[SPEAKER_01]: large scale for a while now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the companies, Crete or La
Roche, those companies that are producing
[SPEAKER_01]: this equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So building those individual pieces of
equipment is a challenge right now due to
[SPEAKER_01]: supply chain issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if it wasn't a single piece of
equipment from one of those companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: these can run anywhere up to three million
dollars, depending on the size and the
[SPEAKER_01]: type of processing equipment that we want
to import.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a substantial investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the same time, those
processors that are coming into that
[SPEAKER_01]: middle space in the market also need to be
coordinating with the manufacturers who
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to take that processed material
and convert that into a final product,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that's a textile that goes on to
use in clothing or automobiles or
[SPEAKER_01]: furniture or other sources or an
insulation product or hemp creep block,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also need to coordinate with the
producers who are on the cultivation side,
[SPEAKER_01]: helping them to choose the right genetics
and to make sure that there will be
[SPEAKER_01]: someone there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They plant their crop that in a couple
months that there will actually be someone
[SPEAKER_01]: in place to purchase and utilize that
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they have invested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is sort of the challenge of
building up this entire industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we start?
[SPEAKER_01]: The having that sort of middle processing
component in place is very important,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's also a fine line to walk for
those who are investing in that space
[SPEAKER_01]: because they have to manage both sides of
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, they're also in a very
unique place to have the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: help to set the standards and to build
that supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you mentioned different
applications, whether it be for a textile
[SPEAKER_02]: or hemp creed or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is the actual processing of the
material different for those different
[SPEAKER_02]: applications?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even in the textile space, there is
processing equipment and even in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, harvesting methods that you would
use if you want to produce a long textile
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have an example here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see it, but it's a very long
fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the redding practices that you use,
how you harvest it, you want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, keep all of the individual
stems parallel for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not all mixed together,
how they would be, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: for hay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping everything parallel from the
point of harvest all the way through
[SPEAKER_01]: processing is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kind of equipment that you use,
whether you're going to do skitching and
[SPEAKER_01]: hackling, there's all these fun terms that
come into play in the fiber hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: processing world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The choices that you're making there are
different than if you want to produce what
[SPEAKER_01]: we might call cottonized hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is really short fiber hemp that
could then be used for spinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're thinking about developing a
100% hemp t-shirt, you're going to go for
[SPEAKER_01]: a cottonized hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the manufacturing line, so from the
field processing line, it's going to look
[SPEAKER_01]: very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's similar, so I think a lot of your
audience is really familiar with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different choices you can make in
processing high cannabinoid hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make a hash product,
you're going to make a ton of different
[SPEAKER_01]: choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to select different cultivars
based on their trichome architecture and
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to take those plants,
potentially freeze them right out after
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest rather than dry and cure them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those things are very different
depending on the final product,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's exactly the same for fiber hemp
processing as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about bees, because we're
running out of time here, and I do want to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that we talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us a bit about the research that
you did looking into how hemp can support
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the pollinator population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Nate and I, when we took on this
project, we were able to connect with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of growers who had formal
collaborations with our university during
[SPEAKER_01]: the early days of our hemp production
program here in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our growers were essentially
collaborating in some shape or form with
[SPEAKER_01]: our land grant universities to help
understand what the challenges would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were welcomed to come and visit many
of the farms across the state to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: their challenges were in the field,
but also to see what opportunities hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: presented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, we found a huge array of
different bee species that were visiting
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial hemp fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that they were there was to
collect pollen from male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unlike cannabinoid hemp production,
where you want a complete completely
[SPEAKER_01]: female field, so every plant would be
female, in grain and fiber hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: production, we have mixed stands of both
female and male plants, or in some cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: we even have malicious plants,
which means that they're actually selected
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce both male and female flowers on
the same plant, which is uncommon for hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: generally, but we do see that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're out there collecting pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp and cannabis generally produces no
nectar for the bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're really just there to collect
that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they use that pollen, they collect it,
bring it back to their nests, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: feed their developing offspring on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are, of course, really
familiar with honey bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after we published this paper,
we got a lot of buzz around maybe the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to produce high cannabinoid
honeys, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, while the bees seem to very much
focus their foraging attention on hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: even when other floral resources are
available to them, in terms of the overall
[SPEAKER_01]: scheme of what they're bringing back to
their hives, at least in a diverse region,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we have here in New York state,
it's pretty small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pollen, which does have
cannabinoids in it, still at such a low
[SPEAKER_01]: level that you would really need to eat a
substantial portion of honey in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: get even a small dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I calculated out a 25 milligram
dose of cannabinoids would take you about
[SPEAKER_01]: a thousand pounds of honey or more,
just at the natural level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not to say there aren't other
folks out there who are experimenting with
[SPEAKER_01]: different methods of introducing
cannabinoids to hives or sort of focusing
[SPEAKER_01]: more of the foraging effort of a colony on
hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say if you're getting hemp
honey advertised to you, it's almost
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly not something that's a naturally
created process and spontaneous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's most likely cannabinoids that have
been added to a honey product after the
[SPEAKER_01]: bees were involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm still very much interested in
beneficial insects, including bees that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be supported by hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the bee species that we found,
so outside of the European honeybee,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, we have bumblebees,
which are native here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a wide array of other small native
bees that were using hemp, many of which
[SPEAKER_01]: are very important pollinators of other
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pollinators of tomatoes, apples,
strawberries, blueberries, squash,
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkins, all of these other really high
value crops, which, you know, may be
[SPEAKER_01]: lacking floral resources on the farm at
the period when those crops aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: blooming and hemp can help to fill that
gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: When there's no other flowers around,
it can support some of those bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we also need to be aware that
it's not providing nectar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking not only about the resources
that it provides, but also if we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to make crop protection choices,
we need to account for the fact that there
[SPEAKER_01]: could be beneficial insects like
pollinators there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to think about that, for even these
crops that are not pollinator dependent,
[SPEAKER_01]: but maybe supporting a lot of beneficial
insects as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the difference between pollen
and, I mean, obviously there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between pollen and nectar,
but in terms of the bees, how do they use
[SPEAKER_02]: each?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you so much for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm such a bug nerd that I
don't always think about what people who
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't as focused on bees and the floral
resources and rewards that they provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nectar is usually sort of that sugary
secretion that often comes from the base
[SPEAKER_01]: of petals, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hemp does not provide that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many other crops, buckwheat, for example,
is a crop that provides great resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goldenrod, which we have abundantly here
in the Northeast, is an excellent floral
[SPEAKER_01]: resource that provides a ton of nectar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pollen is really the key protein
source for bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned before that bees are
collecting all of that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the process of collecting,
they're pollinating our crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's really secondary in their
objective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not necessarily an objective
of theirs at all, but they are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting that pollen and bringing it
back to their nests in order to feed their
[SPEAKER_01]: developing offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the almost entire life cycle of a bee
is spent underground, in most cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% of bees nest in the ground or in their
nest, and they consume pollen as larvae
[SPEAKER_01]: and then develop into a bee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the time, they're in this
larval stage underground, and it's only
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a few weeks out of the year for most
bee species that we see them in their
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristic bee form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really important protein source for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bees are actually sort of carnivores,
but focused on this high protein resource
[SPEAKER_01]: that's provided by plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned that it seems like the
bees actually prefer hemp to other flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: that may be in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we haven't done a big formal study
of that, but I was really shocked to have
[SPEAKER_01]: observed these that had many other floral
resources available to them, seemingly
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing heavily on the hemp crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in one of our large fiber trials last
year, there was a ton of bees visiting
[SPEAKER_01]: that planting all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: A large field of buckwheat planted right
next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, that's a crop that
provides a great source of nectar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very few bees on that crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fields of clover cover crop nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a high protein source of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very few bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were really excited about foraging on
the hemp, potentially because the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: is so much more easily accessible on hemp
plants because they're releasing it onto
[SPEAKER_01]: the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really interested to look,
though, to see if there are potential
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits of having access to this unique
floral resource, either because of its
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional composition, high protein
relative to other sources, perhaps,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if there are any effects of these
cannabinoid or terpene molecules that may
[SPEAKER_01]: be present in the hemp pollen that could
have beneficial effects for the bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bees don't have endocannabinoid systems
like we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no insects have the active CB1,
CB2 receptors that typically is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's how we sense the effects
of cannabinoids in our own body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insects lack those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't mean that they're not
having other effects, beneficial or
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise on those insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some speculation about
potential effects of cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigating some of the diseases that we're
really worried about in pollinator
[SPEAKER_01]: populations right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be great to have the
opportunity to work with a student on a
[SPEAKER_01]: project like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now when you mentioned that,
you know, when hemp is being grown for
[SPEAKER_02]: fiber or for, well, for fiber,
that, you know, the concern about having
[SPEAKER_02]: males isn't as high, obviously,
because, you know, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce seeds in your flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm thinking back to your your
field day at Cornell, where you said that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing both for fiber and for
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you manage how do you manage
that and make sure that some of the male
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen or do you not grow males?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we absolutely have male plants in our
green and fiber trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for our cultivars that are not
mometias, so producing both male and
[SPEAKER_01]: female on the same plant for grain
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need those male plants there to
pollinate our female plants and to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: grain in fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, male plants have some benefits,
some positive attributes relative to
[SPEAKER_01]: female plants, especially for textile
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to have finer fiber structures
on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really do want to have a lot of
males in our production for those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is we spend a lot of time
coordinating among our entire research
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have, you know, we have this issue
in many different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pollen transfer is certainly one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are lucky at Cornell to have a
really large system of research farms
[SPEAKER_01]: spread across the region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have facilities on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have facilities at our agri-tech campus
in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms here in our Ithaca region,
and then other research farms that are
[SPEAKER_01]: spread out across the state that can help
us to achieve some separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, though, at our agri-tech
campus, which is part of our research hub
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis and hemp, we have a lot of
programs going on there interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber grain and cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we try to space our plants around.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to our page that talks about all
of the research work that we do there,
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually did a study a few years back,
looking at how far pollen is likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: move and where that risk of pollination
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do a good job of coordinating
the placement of our different trials so
[SPEAKER_01]: that our fiber cultivar trial is not
pollinating our high cannabinoid trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also work with industry partners who
are developing new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an example of this is the triploid
genetics that are being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are really involved in researching
those cultivars and sort of giving them a
[SPEAKER_01]: really good pollen-heavy challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was part of our field day last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those who came to the field, they could
actually see these triploid cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: grown in an area right next to a large
fiber production field where there was an
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly high pressure of pollen to see
how well they perform in that environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already kept you over the time that I
promised.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I let you go, I did want to
just ask you, you mentioned that you work
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot with your students on capstone
projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to give you an opportunity to
talk about some of the ones that have
[SPEAKER_02]: really stood out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I know that you mentioned that one of
them just recently published.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say that's one of the great
privileges that I have in my role on the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp team here at Cornell is mentoring our
hemp professional degree students in their
[SPEAKER_01]: capstone projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So throughout the course of the fall and
spring semester, and usually also into the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer, our students are working
intensively on whatever area is really of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned before, we have this really
broad curriculum because we want students,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially who are in our professional
master's program, to really understand all
[SPEAKER_01]: components of the industry because we
believe that's critical for helping to
[SPEAKER_01]: build a workforce and to build a
well-integrated, strong industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we recognize also that students come
with a desire to focus in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: areas, whether that's understanding
lighting issues and what the most
[SPEAKER_01]: effective lighting practices are,
or maybe processing and analytical
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so each student sort of has the option
to work with industry partners and,
[SPEAKER_01]: most critically, with really strong
mentorship from our faculty to help to
[SPEAKER_01]: design a project that they can tackle,
which ideally addresses a challenge within
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the one that was just actually
published today, congrats to Andrei Galas,
[SPEAKER_01]: who led this project, was based on an
observation that Andrei had with some
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators who were working in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in, it was probably the fall of
2019 that he was in dialogue with some
[SPEAKER_01]: growers in the Northeast that had
experienced that fall, a really hard frost
[SPEAKER_01]: just prior to harvesting their crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases, they lost their crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other cases, they were able to recover
some of that harvest, but they really were
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in understanding what impact
that would have on their plants or what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens so as the climate becomes more
variable, these frosts become less
[SPEAKER_01]: predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would happen if that had happened
earlier in the early flowering stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Andrei set out to design this
experiment to help answer that question
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew out plants starting at different
dates so that he would have an array of
[SPEAKER_01]: three different ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did some acclimation experiments where
he allowed some of those to sort of come
[SPEAKER_01]: to this gradual cool temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of those plants,
as well as some that had not been
[SPEAKER_01]: acclimated, were exposed to different
amounts of freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some got one freezing for a few hours,
and some had consecutive multiple freezing
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He measured a whole bunch of plant stress
responses, as well as looking at the final
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass that was produced by those plants
in terms of the flower biomass,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is most important for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also looked at how that might
impact cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some other work that has also been
published out of our hemp team program
[SPEAKER_01]: here led by Jacob Toth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic experiment looking at how stress
influences cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big concern in the industry,
especially when we think about that 0.3%
[SPEAKER_01]: limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been debate about bringing that up
to 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he found is that stress is not a
big factor in driving plants above that
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance threshold of 3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he tested plants with herbicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did many different things to stress
these plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really underscored the fact that
it's based on the plants genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: drive that change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with cannabinoids, we also expected
that to be the case with this cold stress
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the impact of cold stress on
the changes in cannabinoid profile?
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that, of course, there are
differences among cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing we are concerned about in
terms of frost, especially very late in
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, is the potential to actually lose
trichomes through physical impact on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, we're thinking about making
an ice water hash, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know when we get those trichomes really
cold, they become very fragile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that we were also
looking for in that publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll make sure to pass that on to you
so you can include a link to that in your
[SPEAKER_01]: show notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I will absolutely do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's interesting that stress doesn't
seem to have a big impact on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm curious, what about terpenes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as I understand it, terpenes can
sort of be used to ward off pests or be
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a response to stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did you find anything there?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not look at terpenes in either
Jacob or Andre's study.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we are very excited to begin
incorporating studies looking at terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: in a lot of our research going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have an HPLC in our teaching lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have now a new mini GC from
Lucidity Systems, which is a CEM
[SPEAKER_01]: corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that allows us to evaluate plants that
we grow out and use in our courses for
[SPEAKER_01]: both the cannabinoid profile and their
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to work with students
on developing methods that are tailored to
[SPEAKER_01]: those machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our big testing lab on campus of our
research analytical facility has a really
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent new GC system from Agilent,
which is sort of sole purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it for many things,
but we will be using it solely for looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at terpene profiles in our research
program here for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very excited to start looking at that
more to see how stress may impact terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles or just regular cultivation
practices could be influencing them or
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of different angles
that we're excited to work on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks again for staying late.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I let you go, I do want to give
you an opportunity to plug any website,
[SPEAKER_02]: social media, anything that people can do
to get in touch with you or just follow
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So folks can find me on the Cal School of
Integrative Plant Sciences website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's a great place to connect with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would encourage folks to attend our
field day in August in Geneva if they can
[SPEAKER_01]: make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, there may potentially be some
recordings that could be made of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always handouts from our field
days that are posted on our hemp team
[SPEAKER_01]: research and extension page.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just Google Cornell hemp,
you will almost certainly find that as the
[SPEAKER_01]: very top response on your page and you
will find all of our faculty who are
[SPEAKER_01]: involved with different areas of research
and all of the many, many reports that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have been producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great place if you're an
industry member who's looking to partner
[SPEAKER_01]: with Cornell to get in touch with faculty
who have expertise in different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will also put out a plug for any
industry members who are excited about
[SPEAKER_01]: working with our professional master
students on capstone projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the students who have worked with
me in our professional master's program
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on hemp have done capstone
projects in collaboration with industry
[SPEAKER_01]: partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a great success so far and we're
always looking for new ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Heather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for joining us and sharing
all the great work that you're doing over
[SPEAKER_02]: there in Cornell and hope to see you soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll make it out there for field
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would love to see you, Ben,
and anybody in the audience who can make
[SPEAKER_01]: it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
