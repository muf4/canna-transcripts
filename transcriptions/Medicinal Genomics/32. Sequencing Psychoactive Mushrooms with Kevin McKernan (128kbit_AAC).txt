[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Conference every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head over to canmedevents.com now to learn
all about our CanMed 2021 event that will
[SPEAKER_00]: take place at September 29th through
October 1st at the Pasadena Convention
[SPEAKER_00]: Center in Pasadena, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're listening to this podcast
the day that it comes out, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday, July 7th, then today is the
last day that you can purchase your full
[SPEAKER_00]: conference pass at our early bird rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a $300 savings off the full price
of that ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go over to canmedevents.com right now
and get your ticket so you'll be all set
[SPEAKER_00]: to join us in Pasadena.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other news, we have officially launched
our CanMed Archive page, which includes
[SPEAKER_00]: over 100 CanMed presentation videos dating
back to our first event in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CanMed Archive is a free searchable
video library covering a range of topics
[SPEAKER_00]: related to cannabis science, medicine,
cultivation, and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to canmedevents.com and click the
banner on the homepage to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to remind everyone that the
healthcare provider study we are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Cannabis Center of Excellence is
still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a healthcare provider,
please take a few minutes to complete the
[SPEAKER_00]: survey to help us better understand
medical cannabis knowledge, attitudes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and practices among healthcare providers
in the US and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an added incentive, one lucky
participant will win a CanMed 2021
[SPEAKER_00]: practicum and full conference ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: The link to access that survey is in the
show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, this episode's guest needs no
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin McKernan of Medicinal Genomics is
back to talk about psilocybin and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms that create it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin and the team at MGC have published a
highly contiguous reference genome for
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybe cubensis, which some listeners
may know is the species of mushroom often
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as the magic mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin and the team have also sequenced
several different mushroom strains to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and better understand the genes of
interest and pathways responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new to psilocybin and mushrooms,
don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cover the basics as well as new
findings in our conversation, including
[SPEAKER_00]: potential therapeutic applications for
psilocybin, what is fueling the rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: growing interest in psilocybin,
psilocybin's path towards legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: other psychoactive compounds found in
mushrooms, how mushrooms are cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: and bred, and what that means for applying
genomics, the discovery that there is more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one way mushrooms synthesize
psilocybin, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Kevin, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, The New Scientist Magazine,
and their upcoming campaign titled,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Future of Psychedelic Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Future of Psychedelic Medicine
campaign highlights the R&D and
[SPEAKER_00]: innovations currently taking place within
the psychedelic space to raise awareness
[SPEAKER_00]: for how psychedelic medicine could
transform mental health treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The campaign also aims to highlight the
potential psychedelic medicine has to help
[SPEAKER_00]: with a range of mental health conditions,
including depression, addiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety, PTSD, abuse disorders,
OCD, and address the stigma surrounding
[SPEAKER_00]: this type of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read The Future of Psychedelic Medicine
campaign on July 22nd in The New Scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: Magazine and on healthawareness.co.uk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: McKernan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's really odd to have such an
outsider on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's funny you say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were the first guest on the podcast,
and now you are the first repeat guest on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations on making history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of making history, you recently
published a highly contiguous reference
[SPEAKER_00]: genome for the psilocybe cubensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to say that as well, but the way
I've heard people who are more familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with this space than I am is I call it
psilocybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I used to call it psilocybe as well
because psilocybin is probably what you've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the compound it makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to lay some groundwork here in
terms of terms for people who might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: as familiar here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So psilocybe is the genus of mushroom,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then psilocybe cubensis is a species
of mushroom that's typically referred to
[SPEAKER_00]: as the magic mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That produces psilocybin, which is the
psychoactive compound that makes you trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now to make things more confusing,
there's also this compound called
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can trip over that one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was going to be one of my
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say all five things fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there compounds in addition to
psilocybin that can create the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a suggested entrage effect,
if you will, that we don't know much about
[SPEAKER_01]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how psychoactive they are,
but they're certainly tryptamines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's other tryptamines in the
mushroom that are in the pathway,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like in cannabis where there is a
livitol and then you get CBG and then CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: gets folded into a variety of other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just some other thing going on in
making these tryptamines is that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: precursors to psilocybin, which is
psilocin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the pathway, there's also
these other different methylation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule, much like maybe different tails
you might have on cannabinoids that are
[SPEAKER_01]: biocystin and origination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's nor psilocin and nor
biocystin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a spectrum of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say we mostly know about psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do know the mushrooms make a
variety of these different compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't yet know which mushrooms make
how much of each of them and what the
[SPEAKER_01]: contributions are to the psychoactive
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot to learn there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that came up very recently
that people may not fully appreciate on
[SPEAKER_01]: these mushrooms is they also make
monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This changes the metabolism of these
compounds in your stomach or in your
[SPEAKER_01]: liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of rare in that when you
look at the story of other tryptamines,
[SPEAKER_01]: like DMT is quite known, in ayahuasca,
but they actually have to mix ayahuasca
[SPEAKER_01]: with some other plant that makes a
monoamine oxidase inhibitor, because DMT
[SPEAKER_01]: itself doesn't get through the gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mushrooms figured out a couple
different tricks here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's figured out how to phosphorylate
psilocin into psilocybin so that it can
[SPEAKER_01]: get through your GI.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also figured out how to make these
other monoamine oxidase inhibitors to
[SPEAKER_01]: alter your liver metabolism so that more
of these things get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot going on inside this time
of the year, but it's a tiny little
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think piqued your interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shares a lot of the same similarities
to Canvas in that one molecule was getting
[SPEAKER_01]: all the credit when there's probably more,
and it looks like it's probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be going medical soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it's recreationally approved in
several jurisdictions, including three
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to understand which mushrooms
make these other entourage effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: we wanted to just go do a huge survey and
all the mushrooms out there to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: if we could find genetics that altered the
expression of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of where it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like interest in psilocybin is at
an all-time high now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's fueling this interest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's several things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the best work on this is out of
Johns Hopkins looking at cancer-related
[SPEAKER_01]: depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, at CanMed, I kept meeting people
that have also seen some remarkable
[SPEAKER_01]: effects in cancer, like glioblastoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Bonnie Goldstein told me about one
case that responded to psilocybin for
[SPEAKER_01]: glioblastoma that was not responding to
cannabis, which is kind of fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand the pathway and why,
but they are neurogenerative, so they do
[SPEAKER_01]: have the capacity to reprogram this
default mode network in your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to have a lot of the properties
of CBD in that they're neuroplastic and
[SPEAKER_01]: they help regenerate neurons.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at this, I think,
for beyond just depression, but probably
[SPEAKER_01]: PTSD and maybe even brain injuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That work's really exciting that when you
look at the work in depression,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems to be more promising than
cannabinoids in many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Johns Hopkins, they're doing three
treatments and getting over 70% success
[SPEAKER_01]: rates, and then it's permanent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like this chronic, you must be on
CBD the rest of your life type of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: for PTSD or THC, whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you tend to see with cannabinoids is
folks tend to be using those consistently
[SPEAKER_01]: to manage the effects, whereas the data
that you're seeing with psilocybin is that
[SPEAKER_01]: three guided treatments, these are
therapies that are monitored with
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals, and they have a massive
success rate on turning around depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see that in a lot of other
antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like you're on them for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious if that's one reason why it's
not getting a whole lot of attention from
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, there was a recent article in
New England Journal of Medicine that was
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing psilocybin with, it wasn't
fluoxetine, but it was a similar SSRI,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the traditional tricyclic
antidepressants that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some drawbacks to those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my earliest work in this field at
Emory was on those compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not as serotonin selective as you
think.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come with all types of labels,
such as suicidal ideation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are a little frightening when you're
trying to treat suicidal ideation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and one of the side effects in the label
is suicidal ideation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're kind of putting the patient in a
little bit of a catch-22 there as to
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not this drug is going to work
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing that with psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, certainly, we don't have these
randomized controlled trials that might
[SPEAKER_01]: find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is certainly a lot of, I think,
human population use of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like cannabis, we have hundreds if not
thousands of years of human experience
[SPEAKER_01]: dosing with these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The toxicology on this is understood as
they're not toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I've even seen some evidence,
I'll have to find a good citation for
[SPEAKER_01]: this, but generally LSD and psilocybin are
thought to be less toxic than even the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, if you can believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just not overdoses with these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might do stupid things on them,
but they're not chemically toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about lasting effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear people who trip and they're never
the same again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a good resource on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet Johns Hopkins has better data on
what some of these chronic conditions and
[SPEAKER_01]: flashbacks and other things that you hear
about may play a role in because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly the same type of conundrum we
have looking at schizophrenia in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and looking at mental illness with these
psychedelics is that they attract a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who have a mental illness and are
seeking to treat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes, you don't know whether the
compound helped or accelerated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those need good randomized controlled
trials to really sort out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certainly that issue with the
current treatment status that we have with
[SPEAKER_01]: SSRIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a lot of these, unfortunately,
when you hear about a lot of these gun
[SPEAKER_01]: effects, in the United States where
there's kids that are running around
[SPEAKER_01]: shooting up schools, it's quite frequently
they're on SSRIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to be reckoned with here
that the current treatments we have aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: clean of those things either.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be looking at things that are
non-toxic and be giving these alternatives
[SPEAKER_01]: a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you had mentioned there
when you were talking about three
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments that could eliminate symptoms,
you mentioned guided treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the supervision of a professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could speak more on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what those are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not experienced one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably a better question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to find somebody who has more
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that more prudent in this type of
therapeutic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are such powerful compounds
that somebody who has a bad experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with them probably needs a sober person
next to them to help talk them off the
[SPEAKER_01]: ledge, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the intent there, is that the
dosages that they're using for these types
[SPEAKER_01]: of reversing depression almost permanently
are up and using one to three grams of
[SPEAKER_01]: these mushrooms, which if they're 1%
psilocybin, these things get up into,
[SPEAKER_01]: what does that put us at?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's three grams, it's 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 30 milligrams of pure compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a whole interest in mind
microdosing these things, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not putting yourself into the
point where you start to hallucinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just getting a serotonin agonist
in your system that is a bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people are reporting that they have
more productivity on these things,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're better for computer
programming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have these waves out in Silicon Valley
where there seems to be this popularity in
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing these things for almost as a
performance enhancing drug, not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily for sports, but for getting
work done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's necessarily getting
guided.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's self-guided, but I think
when you get into the stage where you
[SPEAKER_01]: start getting dissociative effects,
as a safety side of the equation,
[SPEAKER_01]: they probably won't have someone else
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole idea of microdosing,
is that psilocybin specifically or are
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these other psychoactive
compounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hearing of it with LSD and with
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it probably spans the gamut.
[SPEAKER_01]: But dipping my toe in there and just
talking to people, it seems as if
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms are quite popular for that,
just because there's some slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: different pharmacology to those in LSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: LSD is extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The receptor biology there, I probably
need a refresher on, but psilocybin is
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly hitting serotonin, it's 5-HD2A,
and LSD may tickle a few others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we've talked a bit about the
therapeutic uses for psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you mentioned that it's legalizing in
more states.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you see the legalization of
psilocybin?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the path there, and how similar is
it to what we've seen with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to proceed faster than
cannabis because it can go in the wake of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can follow the same model.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can go through and effectively utilize
the same, all right, let's get medical up
[SPEAKER_01]: first, and then perhaps there'll be a
recreational component to this later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much of the legislation for doing
dispensaries is already in place,
[SPEAKER_01]: and people know how to use that playbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've already seen Oregon go completely
recreational, I should say recreational,
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalized in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Berkeley, Oakland, Denver,
Cambridge, Somerville, and Northampton
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Massachusetts have all done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some rumblings of other
jurisdictions as well, maybe in D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: and a few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems as if it is moving at a bit of
a faster pace than cannabis originally
[SPEAKER_01]: did, where we first saw cannabis back when
the HIV epidemic just started.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the medical campaign, it took almost
a decade for more of that to spread,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas we're seeing the psilocybin motion
go rampant very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Canada is probably taking the lead
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to have moved ahead much faster
than anyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hopeful it'll move much quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, exactly how it's going to roll in the
marketplace is a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis flower is still half the market,
and you have all these other edibles and
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts, and I don't think that's going
to go away because there's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: connoisseur of people who like terpenes
and like the experience of smoking flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that we have that with
chewing these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not shiitake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not shiitake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to go more into an
extract mode or capsules or teas,
[SPEAKER_01]: who knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's certainly a different barrier
to entry as it comes to growing these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you want to get involved
growing cannabis, if it's indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's quite a setup involved there to
get lights and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a hydro and everything else
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors, perhaps you set it and forget it
outside and hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it certainly takes more like eight to
12 weeks to get something off of a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant, whereas these mushrooms
can grow in two months in a Tupperware bin
[SPEAKER_01]: in your basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: The barrier to entry is much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be more people trying to home
grow these, much like beer, than you might
[SPEAKER_01]: see with cannabis that requires lots of
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growing cannabis in your house,
if it would know, just stinks up your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very hard to deal with that if you want to
keep it discreet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the case with some of these
folks who like to cultivate these things
[SPEAKER_01]: on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there still will be a home grow
market and a dispensary-based market for
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also progress moving on
the therapeutic side through the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people are optimistic that we'll see
MDMA probably through a successful trial
[SPEAKER_01]: this year and maybe get some advancement
The FDA has designated this as a
[SPEAKER_01]: breakthrough therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means it's going to have an
accelerated path through the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think once the FDA has some approved
versions of this, that will help guide the
[SPEAKER_01]: folks in the nutraceutical side what to do
and how to apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there'll probably be some labeling
constraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet the FDA is not going to want to see
the dispensaries or the nutraceutical side
[SPEAKER_01]: making medical claims and whatever they're
selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's going to very much lead
the charge that when you start seeing the
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA versions of these things roll out,
it's going to give many of the physicians
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole lot more comfort and it's going to
give, I think, better guidance as to how
[SPEAKER_01]: these should be handled in the dispensary
side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping we could talk a bit more
about the cultivation of this because like
[SPEAKER_00]: you said, it is very different from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking from a genomic side too,
how does the difference in the cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: of these mushrooms kind of affect how
genomics could be used for breeding or any
[SPEAKER_01]: other purpose?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one reason why we set about
sequencing all these genomes is just to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out how is this market going to be
different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is so diverse that every time you
make a cross, you're playing, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gambling with a new game, which is kind of
fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get new genetics every cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the market here seems to be
propagating asexually derived spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's actually a little bit more
clonal consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we sequence the first 80 genomes
here, we did it all with spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can ship spores legally,
which is really bizarre because you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: ship cannabis seeds legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe you can do the hemp seeds now,
but in the past, you couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with spores, they're legal for
taxonomic purchase because there's no,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't detect any psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone gets caught with spores,
they ultimately test to see if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule compound and if there isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've heard from some people,
although this is an illegal opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: so don't bank on this, but I've heard from
some people that you can actually culture
[SPEAKER_01]: them with minimal mediums.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't express anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically what happens is people will
get spores from either a spore print or
[SPEAKER_01]: from a syringe where they've, they'll put
the spores in some kind of liquid media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're in a 10, 10 mil syringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll inject that into a
sterilized bag of grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things love to grow in grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to be a very, very pure,
pure injection.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any bacteria around the
bacteria, like we experienced doing all
[SPEAKER_01]: this plating and stuff with, on the
cannabis microbial detection front,
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's any bacteria around,
it doubles every like 30 minutes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: mold can take a month to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bacteria can like take over the
thing and destroy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal is to get a spawn bag that
has grown with mycelium from this thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that takes maybe a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once that's done, you immerse
that grain that's got a full mycelium
[SPEAKER_01]: grown throughout it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You dunk it in water for 24 hours to
simulate like a rain storm, pull it out
[SPEAKER_01]: and put it in a humidity chamber for in a
few weeks, you have lots of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the key, the key aspects are
making sure that there is absolutely clean
[SPEAKER_01]: spores going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing we did notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did use some of our PCR tools that we
have here to look for total aerobic count
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw many of the different spores
that were provided had high levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: tack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those tended to have, you know,
they gave us more sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how well they grow,
but I've heard from people that growing
[SPEAKER_01]: those can be complicated if there's any
bacteria around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can gauge which ones that we can
get clean genomes from just upfront by
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at how much bacterial to fungal
DNA is around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by looking at that ratio, we can say,
okay, this one's got a lot more fungal DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: than bacterial DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use that one for sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's got too much bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't sequence it or you'll get a
metagenome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was probably in like 20 to 30% of
the spores that we collected, we threw out
[SPEAKER_01]: or when we sequenced it, we realized that
they were dirty and they gave us dirtier
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So...
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, would that be like a beneficial
upfront screening tool for whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: you were going to try to grow that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine as you scale this up,
a lot of people are growing these in
[SPEAKER_01]: compartmentalized boxes for that reason,
because if they get a bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminant, they don't want it to go
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they break them up into small bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even so, how they're getting those
spores, I would imagine to scale this up,
[SPEAKER_01]: syringes probably don't scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably have to put the syringes
into some type of liquid culture and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge culture and then spread that
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you would want to monitor that large
culture to make sure that there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial contamination in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some folks who are a little
concerned about putting antibiotics in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mix too, because the antibiotics sometimes
slow down the growth of the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, they don't want it
to get absorbed into the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people start eating, you know,
gentimis and labeled mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're trying to do this without
adding any antibiotics, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means you probably have to be very
sterile in the process and maybe even
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor for bacterial load throughout the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought up an interesting point in the
genomics of this, which is this works
[SPEAKER_01]: really well in cubensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cubensis isn't the only species that
makes these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's about 200 different mushrooms that
make psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even one that infects cicadas that
makes them hypersexual and spread the
[SPEAKER_01]: spores every 16 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's called massapora, which is a
really interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It infects the cicada and then starts
making psilocybin inside the cicada so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it goes crazy and ends up getting
bisexual and hypersexual and starts
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading spores everywhere in sort of
like an orgy fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one's a really bizarre genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 600 megabases, which is much
larger than the 45 megabase genomes we see
[SPEAKER_01]: with cubensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're trying to look at by
sequencing outside of the cubensis species
[SPEAKER_01]: is to see, do they all make psilocybin in
the same way?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some great work out there by
Jason Slott's lab and Reynolds and Frick
[SPEAKER_01]: and Hofmeister.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all folks who have published in
this area that have noticed that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the psilocybin synthesis genes are all
clustered together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in this tight little 20 kb
region in the genome, and that seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: horizontally transfer to other mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also been some evidence that
they're not always clustered together in
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these other mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pathways are a little bit more
separated, and we don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're also diverged enough from a
sequencing standpoint that the primers
[SPEAKER_01]: that we use in the cubensis front probably
aren't going to work really well when you
[SPEAKER_01]: go into tamponensis or when you go into
azuricens or mexicana.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all these other types of
mushrooms that make... They're all
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybe, and there's a couple that are
even outside of psilocybe that make
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin, but they are sequent from a
sequencing standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're diverged enough that the primers
we use to target these genes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cubensis are probably not going to work on
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's different than the cannabis front.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis front, we can pretty much...
Although it's very polymorphic,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can make primers that hit THC and CBD
and these genes pretty readily once we
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good map of 40 or 50 genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can target that throughout the
population without tripping over too many
[SPEAKER_01]: of the differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the differences that we're seeing even
amongst the cubensis lines is probably a
[SPEAKER_01]: variant every 150 bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we see in the hemp front is you get
about a variant every 50 bases if you
[SPEAKER_01]: compare it to something like Jamaican
lion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably about every 100 bases when
you compare it amongst drug type cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: like all type ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more polymorphism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more repetitive in the cannabis
front, but the genes that are responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: for making cannabinoids are really
conserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas you get into the psilocybe front
and it is not just stuck into cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa that makes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this psilocybe, multiple different
species of psilocybe that actually make
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're much more diverged than what we
see in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means the genomics in many ways is
more complicated, but the propagation of
[SPEAKER_01]: it is much more simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't people doing these crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be done, but most people are just
asexually reproducing these spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when they see one particular mushroom
that produces a really large mushroom cap,
[SPEAKER_01]: they grab spores from those and try and
repeat the process because maybe there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: mutation in that one that means it
produces a lot more yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how the game is going now,
but there isn't this... I'm not seeing a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people take different mushrooms and
cross them very much to try and get new
[SPEAKER_01]: varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be probably only very few
people in the world that know how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are just hoping for mutations
inside the batch that they have and then
[SPEAKER_01]: try to propagate those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different game, but I think
genomics is going to play a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already seeing some benefits in that
we're finding variants that are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway that we think are responsible for
certain cultivars or strains, I should
[SPEAKER_01]: say.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a complicated word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a strain in the strand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain is appropriate here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain is appropriate, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Varietals, they don't think are yet
appropriate because the varietals imply
[SPEAKER_01]: you've stabilized the genetics and no
one's doing that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is interesting about them is if you
read about how people do cross them is
[SPEAKER_01]: they put different things down on plates
and grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can back up for a second here
because I'm not sure I fully understand
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain how a mushroom does reproduce
asexually first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got two life cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: One life cycle is when it makes a fruiting
body, it's making a cap, like the mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: that you see, and those are asexually
reproduced spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there is a part of the life cycle
where these things form clamps.
[SPEAKER_01]: When two mycelium grow into each other
from two genetically unique mushrooms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycelium is essentially the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have compatible mating types,
which is something that we have not yet
[SPEAKER_01]: identified, we have some hunches as to
where in the genome the mating type is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is kind of like in cannabis,
there's an X and Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fungi, they have mating types which
aren't limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be a much bigger spectrum of
gender if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get more than just A versus B mating
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some fungi have thousands of mating types.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're compatible mating types,
they'll form a clamp connection,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is two mycelium that's kind of like
a USB port coming together and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: trade a nuclei.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they do that, you end up with a new
part of the mycelium, which is dicariotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has two nuclei in it, which are now two
different genomes together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there can be a stage of its life
cycle where those things go through
[SPEAKER_01]: meiosis and they exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people aren't doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not taking two different things,
putting together and using a microscope to
[SPEAKER_01]: find if they make clamp connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they don't have compatible mating
types, they usually will grow and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be like, you can't see a visual
barrier between the colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't grow into each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mating types are usually pheromones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're compatible pheromones,
then they'll grow into each other and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll get clamps and clamp connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not, they'll kind of grow and
they'll be like a colony exclusion zone
[SPEAKER_01]: there where they don't actually- A little
DMZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little DMZ where they don't touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few people out there that know
how to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're rare, but some are even trying to
cross things across species lines because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some debate that maybe these
things will even cross between species,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike cannabis breeding, there's far more
people in the world that know how to breed
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and do crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the mycology side, at least
with slossaby, you can probably name the
[SPEAKER_01]: people on your hand that know how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people aren't resorting to it because
it's just easier to pick the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom out of a particular box and see
if you can grab those spores and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: propagating and selecting for things that
make very large fruits and have high
[SPEAKER_01]: potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where exactly- Where do the spores
actually come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: They come out of the cap of the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycelium is almost just like a network
of roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not technically correct, but it's
what it looks like on the side of some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these grain or spawn bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once you heavily soak it and wet it,
that's a trigger that, hey, we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: enough water content here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start making fruiting bodies and they pop
out mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when the cap unfolds, those gills in
the cap just dump spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that people can collect
and they can either put those into culture
[SPEAKER_01]: and solution or just collect them on a
piece of tinfoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a spore print on tinfoil and they
can store that and then inoculate
[SPEAKER_01]: something with that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we set out to do is to
see what was the diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you collect- We're not sequencing a
single spore when we do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sequencing collections of spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, we were worried that when you
did that, you might have so much genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: variation, it'd be a mess, but it turns
out you can do it and it's not too messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sequence the genomes and assemble
them and count the variants that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the spores that the cap produces,
are they clonally identical or?
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be haploid and they should be
not 100% identical in that they should
[SPEAKER_01]: represent two different copies of the
diploid parent genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a stage where the diploid genome
starts making haploid copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a good representation when you do
a spore prep of both the mother and the
[SPEAKER_01]: father, if you will, in the original
diploid dicariotic genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes to this weird stage off the point
into a video because it's unlike anything
[SPEAKER_01]: you've seen in mammalian genetics or plant
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have these two different life cycles
of asexual and meiotic reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a video that we have here we can
link to this podcast that walks people
[SPEAKER_01]: through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do sequence a whole collection of
them, you end up getting enough haploid
[SPEAKER_01]: copies from the mother, enough haploid
copies from the father, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can effectively see both versions
of the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There probably are some unique mutations
on any given spore level, but we probably
[SPEAKER_01]: can't see that level of resolution of the
mutations unless we sequence really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really deeply because we're collecting a
million spores at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get an average picture of what the
diploid genome looked like when we
[SPEAKER_01]: sequenced a collection of spores,
but we're not going to see those tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: mutations that might make each spore
itself individually unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they're so small and it would
be kind of impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just such a small number of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: In any spore prep, we might be peppering a
million of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If every one of those had one unique
mutation in them, they'd be drowned out
[SPEAKER_01]: because they'd be one in a million.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real true differences in the parental
lines that make them different,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, those are going to be 50-50 in all
the reads that we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can call those, but the actual really
rare events, we're not going to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said there's two different types of
reproduction, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's asexual as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's asexual, which is what comes out
of the spore generation from the fruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies, but there's another stage that
goes through meiosis after these things
[SPEAKER_01]: have formed a clamp junction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have two nuclei there together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, those nuclei fuse,
and then you go through a meiotic stage
[SPEAKER_01]: where they split again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you can get some of the
genetic recombination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very few people are collecting spores at
that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're collecting the ones that are
really easy to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the purposes of sequencing,
I think just based on the way the law is
[SPEAKER_01]: today, you can legally sequence the
spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't legally go sequence the other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what that does at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen some models of what it does,
but the spores are the one thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have tissue, don't express any of
the compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are legal for taxonomic
purposes, and genomics is like the
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimate taxonomic classifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good on handling the spores that
come out of the fruiting bodies,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's unclear if we're ever going to be
able to, until it legalizes more,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether we can go and investigate some of
the questions that you're asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting towards the end here, what is the
most surprising thing that has come from
[SPEAKER_00]: the work that you've done?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's stunned me about it is the
work that's coming out in the SARS-CoV-2
[SPEAKER_01]: space, where they're seeing these drugs,
not exactly psilocybin, but fluoxetine in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, is very promising for shutting
down the virus replication.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a shocker to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know about that until I read
or saw Peter McCullough's work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who run tricyclics are less likely
to get infected with SARS.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole pathway in the ACE2
receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're expressing ACE2, it
co-expresses doped decarboxylase,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is involved in the serotonin
pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giving people serotonin agonists or
serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors,
[SPEAKER_01]: which accomplish very similar ends,
is fighting off the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea these things play a role
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole focus in the field on
antidepressants, which is great,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if they're antiviral to some extent,
at least viruses that are coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: through ACE2, that's a whole other
interesting side of this story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was exciting to read about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're finding on the genomics front
is that the pathway that makes these
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds is far more complicated than
initially hypothesized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was initially thought that there's this
120 kb cassette that was horizontally
[SPEAKER_01]: transferred everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can now see, when we start sequencing
outside of kubensis, that's not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genes aren't clustered.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're scattered throughout the genomes,
and they're very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already have a really nice picture of
variants in all of these genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're now starting to see other ways these
mushrooms have figured out how to make
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an argument for convergent
evolution going on simultaneously to this
[SPEAKER_01]: horizontal gene transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be interesting because
some of the other non-kubensis species,
[SPEAKER_01]: like azuracens, reportedly make more
psilocybin than kubensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really hard to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mostly in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Paul Stamets is the person who
figured that out or found those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't sequence those very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see them much in the underground
markets for growing, although people do
[SPEAKER_01]: sell the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that they're making psilocybin in
a unique way is very interesting to us
[SPEAKER_01]: because that might help guide what
properties that those mushrooms have can
[SPEAKER_01]: we breed into the more commercial lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly people, for commercial purposes,
are growing kubensis in maybe five or six
[SPEAKER_01]: of those strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly B+, Golden Teacher, Penis Envy,
another enlightening name we have in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think cannabis strain names are bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get into the mushroom space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are probably the three, maybe the
albinos as well, or maybe four,
[SPEAKER_01]: the most commonly used because they grow
very large fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sizes and everything, sadly to use
that pun, because some of the smaller ones
[SPEAKER_01]: are more concentrated in the compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a way to intercross those
or learn what we can learn from AzureSense
[SPEAKER_01]: to get the production up on the other
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, there are some that are named
Baocystin, which I assume is because they
[SPEAKER_01]: make more of that one compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we have this pathway mapped out,
we can begin to look at the variation we
[SPEAKER_01]: see between all these different types of
mushrooms to try to custom breed them in
[SPEAKER_01]: one direction or another, or there's
already people doing work on cloning these
[SPEAKER_01]: things into yeast and getting beer to make
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be the ultimate way to make
some of the more rare versions of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like in cannabis, we're not seeing
people wanting to clone CBD into yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it as a control, but you can get
CBD really cheaply grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBDV and maybe, well, maybe Seth
Crawford has that one nailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these really rare esoteric
cannabinoids that we don't yet know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed into the plant, people will probably
be very successful brewing those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that might be the case with some
of these compounds out of Cubensis as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, that some of the rare ones get
moved, get shuttled into yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since it's fungi to fungi,
that transfer will probably happen really
[SPEAKER_01]: readily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe the more popular ones you want
to breed for mushrooms that just grow very
[SPEAKER_01]: productively, and that might beat the
yeast out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's been a really fun project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to give you actually credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Seth Crawford, their team
actually helped us get that first
[SPEAKER_01]: reference out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they played a pivotal role in getting
some of the sequencing done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, we've now tacked on
another 80 genomes against that reference
[SPEAKER_01]: using Illumina sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's giving us a really nice
perspective on every variant in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway that might be playing a role in
how these genes are behaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really an exciting time for the
field, because suddenly there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain of data to comb through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't comb through it all
ourselves, so we've been putting a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: it into NCBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see another pre-print.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first paper on the reference is out,
published, and peer-viewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're now just submitting another one
that has another 80 genomes that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: playing with to paint a picture of how
complex and complicated this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think after that we have to reach out to
the field a little bit more and find out,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, what are the real pain points?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the market actually need?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such an early market that we don't
know where to move with this data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what might be next is
understanding which variants in each of
[SPEAKER_01]: these genes are connected to the
chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do the chemotypes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to partner with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's people out there that are
really good at chemotyping these things,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want that DNA to sequence it so we can
correlate what variants we're finding that
[SPEAKER_01]: might predict what chemotype you're
getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the next phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to team up with people who do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an equivalent of a cannabis cup I
heard out in Oakland that may be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: help out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're probably going to reach out to
some of those folks and say, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you're chemotyping, if it's one
of these oddballs that makes a really
[SPEAKER_01]: different compound or makes a lot of one
particular compound, let's get it
[SPEAKER_01]: sequenced, pop it onto the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a version of Canapedia that
we're going to fork into being a
[SPEAKER_01]: phylogenetic tree or mycelium,
if you will, that will kind of display
[SPEAKER_01]: these things that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have some of the same
functionality there so that people who get
[SPEAKER_01]: their stuff sequenced with us get it
compared, get a list of variants.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can start tracking these things to
see if they're predicting the patterns
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're seeing on the chemotype
front.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of that is soon to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of work to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I let you go, is there any social
media or websites that you want to plug to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that people can keep up with
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, obviously, Modistil Geomics has a
lot of what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can follow us on either Facebook,
Instagram, Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm occasionally on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the areas that we've been
posting a lot of this content on.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of credit, obviously, going to SES
Group for helping us get the initial
[SPEAKER_01]: reference sequenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a lot of the support
providers that have been helping as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The group at Inoculate the World has been
very supportive in getting us information
[SPEAKER_01]: on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll probably see more of this
getting some attention with the high
[SPEAKER_01]: science group that's going to be coming
through here to take a look at CanMed and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the work that we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another plug for those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safe to assume that your CanMed
presentation this year will be on this
[SPEAKER_00]: talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll have some detail on this as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're going to probably go through
these 80 genomes and whatever we've
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered by September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also doing some very interesting
stuff on the cannabis front.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll probably be some virus
material there that we're working toward
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of the work we're doing with
AOAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this actually was a project that
got kickstarted because we were sequencing
[SPEAKER_01]: so many genomes for AOAC to look at these
yeast and mold tests, like what's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: growing on these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got kind of depressed because we're
constantly focused on the pathogens,
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that hurt people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's giving fungi a bad rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not always hurting people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said, why don't we throw on the same
aluminum runs some of these things that
[SPEAKER_01]: help people just so we're not always
running out there yelling, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: chicken littling the field with dangerous
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world needs to remember that actually
a lot of these fungi are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And particularly for growing cannabis,
getting the root systems like interacting
[SPEAKER_01]: with some of these things is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to spice it up a little bit,
we wanted to make sure we weren't out
[SPEAKER_01]: there being chicken little and fungi and
that there's fungi in the same runs that
[SPEAKER_01]: were quite beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these ended up being fillers for
aluminum runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll see CanMed, we will be equal
opportunity and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll show the bad ones and the good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, looking forward to seeing that
presentation out in Pasadena.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for joining us.
