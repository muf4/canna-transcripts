[SPEAKER_00]: Things are complicated and I'm delighted
that CanMed not only offers analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: help, but also tries to teach the growers
what to use, how to use it, how to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important because drugs have
to be used at a constant level.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cannot just say, I use medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean much.
[SPEAKER_00]: One has to know exactly what is being
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for different disease states,
one uses different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
