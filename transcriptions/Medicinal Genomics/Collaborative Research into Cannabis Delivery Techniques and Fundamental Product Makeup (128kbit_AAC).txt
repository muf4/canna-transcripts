[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning everyone, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a stationary microphone so I can't
walk around the stage because I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: point out that I've seen a few people with
like cannabis socks or t-shirts or jewelry
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't have any of that but I just
wanted to point out I might not have the
[SPEAKER_00]: nicest trousers but they're made out of
hemp so that's my nod to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're made in Patagonia,
by Patagonia so that's down the coastline
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting all the commercial tips here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today when I applied to this to speak
here I wanted to talk about product
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery like what do you actually consume
because in the cannabis industry you test
[SPEAKER_00]: the products but you don't really test
what ends up with the customer and I had
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea of doing skin permeability tests
and tell you how much comes through the
[SPEAKER_00]: skin and research always takes longer than
it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other aspect is inhalation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a combustion or vaporization of
compounds so you don't actually know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you consume if you just test the oil or
the the joint that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is far out point that you apply
to speak and you never know where you get
[SPEAKER_00]: with your research or what is the current
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out this is really timely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are focusing today on the current
research on vaping and it's really the
[SPEAKER_00]: research only so what is known and I try
to stay away from speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to make the point that this is timely
these were just a few cutouts and
[SPEAKER_00]: screenshots that I caught to make this
talk and then a few statistics behind it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it turns out I had to send these
slides on Friday so everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I saw yesterday we had 530 confirmed
cases and we had six deaths, no eight
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths now through the vaping problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could also be the thought maybe we
didn't know what it was and we hadn't seen
[SPEAKER_00]: it we had seen it but not realized what it
was but from the reports that I read and
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature that came out recently this
is new case or these are new symptoms so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not something overlooked but it's
something relatively new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone is trying to figure out what
it could be so as far as I'm aware there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no single course yet identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few ideas what it could be so
I put up a few molecules at the bottom so
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin E acetate is the one that is
highly discussed now particularly through
[SPEAKER_00]: the New York statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also put up MCT oil it's another
stretching agent in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and then PG and VG more from the nicotine
side because anyone who'd done some
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation in the cannabis industry will
realize they don't actually mix with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil and you will see a separation
after a few days so if you sell them quick
[SPEAKER_00]: you're good but they will separate and
then just for popular request we have
[SPEAKER_00]: popcorn lung here as well so diacetyl the
buttery flavor that is not yet seen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vaping in the cannabis industry but it's
at least in the vape or was in the vape
[SPEAKER_00]: industry around and I point out all these
compounds are grass because I heard this a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot over the last years when they talked
about vape oils ingredients and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's grass it's safe it's good so I put up
the statement by FDA and I counted this
[SPEAKER_00]: four times the word food and not a single
time the word smoking or inhalation so
[SPEAKER_00]: these compounds are done for for eating
ingestion not for for smoking thanks to
[SPEAKER_00]: some strong regulatory strong forces on
the regulatory bodies there's very little
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation on in on smoking so that's the
best we can go with right on the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: side so on the grass side I looked up on
the FDA side we are currently at 850 9
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that are on the list so grass
generally recognizes safe so what is on
[SPEAKER_00]: the list or what used to be on the list is
trans fats so the list by itself is not
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect and then secondly I went so I came
here on Sunday I came from Vancouver where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's raining and it's cold and I came here
and it's sunny and beautiful so I went
[SPEAKER_00]: surfing in Malibu and if Baywatch taught
us one thing it's not good to inhale
[SPEAKER_00]: seawater but it's a grass compound so I
think I can make the point that grass is
[SPEAKER_00]: not per se good and definitely not a good
idea for inhalation and then not grass I
[SPEAKER_00]: looked it up because so many people told
me butane extraction is good it's safe and
[SPEAKER_00]: if you inhale some butane it's grass so I
looked it up it's not there no butane no
[SPEAKER_00]: pentane no hydrocarbons it's not mentioned
so that's just the side one on extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: so but focusing on what I could find in
the literature about ingest or inhalation
[SPEAKER_00]: and by the way I will just rumble on
because my timer never started so we will
[SPEAKER_00]: just go until the afternoon on this still
not started anyway so I found one paper
[SPEAKER_00]: from a German group they were concerned
with how much THC do you inhale if you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a joint compared to a dab and I
think that's an interesting aspect to
[SPEAKER_00]: start with because so I assumed this is
CanMed so my audience is mostly doctors so
[SPEAKER_00]: we are thinking about how do we treat
patients how do we give anything to the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients how do we even recommend what
they should consume so let's start with
[SPEAKER_00]: how much cannabis or THC would you even
inhale if you recommend a different
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption method and so here are these
rigged setups and they first showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: in smoking and dabbing there's a complete
decub oxalation so even if you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: THC acid in the product in your product
you consume you will inhale THC there is
[SPEAKER_00]: no THC acid coming through and then
secondly and I that we have to point out
[SPEAKER_00]: is you do not inhale the gas or the vapor
at temperature of combustion or
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporization you inhale something around
44 degrees on average maybe up to 60
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees right no one can inhale and so for
you Americans that is 111 Fahrenheit so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can you could not inhale anything at
150 degrees Celsius that would just burn
[SPEAKER_00]: your lungs literally and side note the
boiling point of THC by the literature if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do the conversion is 425 degrees
Celsius at one atmosphere I've seen the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of a hundred fifty seven around a
lot which is correct if you do it at
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced pressure at five millimeters of
mercury but at one atmosphere it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: 450 and you definitely do not inhale
therefore any THC vapor you would actually
[SPEAKER_00]: inhale small goblets of oil that are
coming through so that's why you can't use
[SPEAKER_00]: normal cigarette filters and small and
cannabis smoking because they would catch
[SPEAKER_00]: all the oil droplets and you wouldn't get
anything and the understanding that oil
[SPEAKER_00]: droplets are inhaled is important for a
second talk that comes after the break by
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle when he talks about heavy metals
because gaseous heavy metals is not what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're inhaling either okay so next point
the other point was recovery or how much
[SPEAKER_00]: THC you actually inhale and here in the
joint they smoked they got to 27 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: of the THC that was in the joint actually
ended up in the simulated lung and for
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing you went at 75 percent recovery so
if you think about treating a patient and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're switching them from joints to dabs
you can't just take the math and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: oh that much THC used to consume now you
do a different method we just use the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount so you have to adjust there but
this study had its limitations because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a as you can see on the picture a
pretty rigged system of how you inhale
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually suck the joint through in
one go they didn't do puff by puff studies
[SPEAKER_00]: so if we look at other research puff by
puff studies this is a set of graphs or
[SPEAKER_00]: diagrams for nicotine inhalation I hope
you can read this all well so what these
[SPEAKER_00]: graphs are showing is the nicotine amount
that is in the vapor per puff in different
[SPEAKER_00]: methods so top right no sorry top left is
a is a vape cartridge so the nicotine
[SPEAKER_00]: level stays consistent because you have an
oil you have a homogeneous mixture you
[SPEAKER_00]: always get the same load every puff but if
you have these heat not burn systems
[SPEAKER_00]: that's bottom left you have a change in
nicotine concentration with every puff
[SPEAKER_00]: which is opposing to the reference
cigarette which is the bottom right where
[SPEAKER_00]: the nicotine concentration increases and
the same principle somewhat applies to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a joint so that you start off with
a low concentration of your active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient and it slowly increases so
here's a study of smoking a spliff from
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany so I had to learn what a spliff is
and in Europe they don't consume
[SPEAKER_00]: straight-up cannabis in a joint they use a
spliff so it's a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine of tobacco together with cannabis
now the reasons for that are unknown to me
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be that we have a less supply of
cannabis in Europe or that they like the
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine aspect to it but what you see is
THC CBN so that's an old joint and
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine start off at low concentration at
the first puff and then slowly increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason for that you could think about
it because the burning of the joint or
[SPEAKER_00]: spliff is at the front and it goes through
the whole system before you inhale so if
[SPEAKER_00]: anything burns and then goes through the
system as a droplet it might just be
[SPEAKER_00]: caught so while it evaporates it never
makes it to your mouth it just gets caught
[SPEAKER_00]: and therefore it's a build-up of higher
nicotine and THC concentration later on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the joint or spliff and then when you get
to that then you can inhale more so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why it's increasing but it's not only THC
nicotine and so on the compounds you
[SPEAKER_00]: measure that you actually inhale there are
a few more other compounds that happen and
[SPEAKER_00]: are produced when you vape or combust the
material so as a chemist this this slide
[SPEAKER_00]: is cool not many chemists in the audience
I guess so just be scared so let's move on
[SPEAKER_00]: so here I have a picture of a different
setup and looks way more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: than the first setup so this is now from a
third group here this is actually from a
[SPEAKER_00]: group in Portland and so they are hooking
and did you see the terpene talk with GCMS
[SPEAKER_00]: headspace analysis yesterday so that's
pretty cool that's very similar to this so
[SPEAKER_00]: this is also the GCMS headspace so to say
where they smoke a cannabis sample inhale
[SPEAKER_00]: it into the GCMS and then measure in the
MS what comes out and while I already
[SPEAKER_00]: early on mentioned there are limitations
to all studies I present in Germany they
[SPEAKER_00]: had a police officer standing there
watching the spliff while it gets smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it doesn't get lost because that
was a cannabis spliff they found of
[SPEAKER_00]: someone when they busted him here in the
US you can't get any cannabis products
[SPEAKER_00]: into a university and do some research on
it so what they did was they bought a
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram of THC in reference standard
evaporated solvent put that milligram onto
[SPEAKER_00]: a test tube or something and then smoked
that milligram and then looked at what
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds actually came out and it was not
only THC so this is pure THC being
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporized and inhaled into the GCMS and so
we see isoprene units we see formaldehyde
[SPEAKER_00]: we see other ketones we see aromatic
systems on the other scale so this already
[SPEAKER_00]: looks complex and you can point out a few
potential harmful substances coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you have a real cannabis sample and
we're jumping back to the German group
[SPEAKER_00]: here there are way more compounds in there
if you have cannabis because and I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: pointed that out on no I didn't so way
more components coming out and there you
[SPEAKER_00]: can now also see the parent THC compound
and CBN compound so let's point out a few
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds isoprene unit bottom left it's
the mother of all terpenes so they
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just while isoprene build
terpenes and then eventually cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: when you combust them or heat them they
can go back and then some car carcinogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: aromatic compounds what we have to point
out is that cannabinoids terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: similar by synthetic heritage and secondly
with the more terpenes they are the more
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile organic compounds you have so the
more stuff can happen and can be formed so
[SPEAKER_00]: if you then dig a little deeper and you
now look at a few harmful compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder how are they produced at different
consumption methods so we have a dabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: so of pure THC THC terpene mixtures that
is SND dab and then vaporization at
[SPEAKER_00]: different voltages so voltages here are
stent and basically for the temperature of
[SPEAKER_00]: the heating element the more electricity
you run through it the hotter it gets it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not the perfect system because all
batteries or heating elements are slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different but it gives you a good
indication and those numbers basically
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate the more voltage you send through
the vaporization mechanism the more of
[SPEAKER_00]: those decomposition products you get and
if you do dab you really have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those your dabs are in temperatures
considerably higher than any of your
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporization methods and then on the risk
factors you cannot try to do like a
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical calculation of how risky it is
to do a consumption method like how bad
[SPEAKER_00]: could it be this is not an absolute
measure and it's based on data that is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the best case indicative of real
consumption because these are based on
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption methods on a machine right the
GCMS we saw and as FDA no not FDA National
[SPEAKER_00]: Science National Institute of Science
pointed out there is currently no
[SPEAKER_00]: indication that cannabis smoking or vaping
actually leads to lung cancer so they are
[SPEAKER_00]: good for comparison not for absolute so
here are the numbers the HI is for non
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer risk and the ELCR is for cancer
risk and when you look at the numbers you
[SPEAKER_00]: see that smoking flower is potentially the
most harmful because you have a combustion
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant material with a lot of compounds
that you could potentially inhale and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we go down the list dabbing and then low
voltage vaping with the potentially less
[SPEAKER_00]: risk for doesn't mean that any of them are
leading to cancer or that none of them
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to cancer it's just a comparison
between the methods and then another slide
[SPEAKER_00]: I could add to this was one of the reports
I saw they talked about synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids as an agent in CBD vape
cartridges CBD is currently the craze the
[SPEAKER_00]: supply of CBD might not be as high as it
has to to cover all the the demand so
[SPEAKER_00]: people were using other cannabinoids to
stretch or synthetic cannabinoids and I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to point out as a chemist there's a
difference between synthesized THC and a
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic cannabinoid they're not the same
thing so synthetic cannabinoids you're
[SPEAKER_00]: shown on the left by basically one of the
godfathers of the thing from John Hoffman
[SPEAKER_00]: from Clemson University these were
molecules made to target the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system so they designed
molecules that would hook onto a CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor in a petri dish and shut it off
to give a perfect response right these
[SPEAKER_00]: things bind and don't leave they were
never designed to actually be consumed by
[SPEAKER_00]: humans because they are full agonists or
total or super agonists while THC or CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: shown here are partial agonists so they
actually leave your brain at some point
[SPEAKER_00]: again so I just wanted to point this out
it is often miscommunicated in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in the industry under or
misunderstood in the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: miscommunicated in the press that
synthetic cannabinoids and cannabis are
[SPEAKER_00]: like two different worlds I think spices
they refer to as spices and bath salts or
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic opioids both are available at
your local gas station so I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: point out again some of the limitations so
this research is all very early on the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of real samples to do tests
are limited I know Kyle will talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: some research he actually did on real
samples if you do a bit of a non-official
[SPEAKER_00]: university study that is possible but if
you do go through the normal routes it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets a bit more complicated and then
another problem seems like a missing
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration of different actors so
health Canada is interested in this
[SPEAKER_00]: universities are interested in this
producers are interested but somehow they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really work together so everyone
starts from scratch and builds it up
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves it would really help if people
would work together and allocate resources
[SPEAKER_00]: and potential a better so I have a few
minutes so let me plug my company so our
[SPEAKER_00]: idea is fundamental collaboration so we
are research institute or research
[SPEAKER_00]: facility that is full aware that we don't
understand everything so I'm a chemist so
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you the molecules I have no idea
what they do on a body but for that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that know that aspect and I have
friends that know how to formulate vape
[SPEAKER_00]: products or other products so we try to
collaborate as much as possible so as I
[SPEAKER_00]: said our focus is on cannabis chemistry
and to point out this collaborative aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: and the understanding that we don't know
everything my team started to compile a
[SPEAKER_00]: list of compounds that are known in the
cannabis plant and we slowly start adding
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition products like CBN that are
not naturally occurring but are found in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production so that we can then
start tracking them and then start
[SPEAKER_00]: assigning values of interest to them so in
our case we start tracking molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: weight melting point solubility in
different compound different solvents and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on so forth so we have 24 compound
categories over 700 compounds I know we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get to a thousand let's just give it
some time why we have 75 cannabinoids on
[SPEAKER_00]: our list I know professor Mary who I very
much admire has more already in his list
[SPEAKER_00]: but we slowly trying to catch up we had
400 terpenes thus yesterday we had like
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 terpenes so I have you beat on that
and then the other aspect is this database
[SPEAKER_00]: is available to collaborate so if you have
some data sets that you want to add to it
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you want to get some other data
sets that we have get out of it we are
[SPEAKER_00]: very happy to collaborate please reach out
to us I want to have this list filled as
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly as possible so that we can have
our metabolomics database of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: related compounds I know they're existing
for other research fields and with that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to thank the authors and researchers
on the on the work I presented and the
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators that helped me make sure
that these slides are all accurate and I
[SPEAKER_00]: put up one of the email addresses of the
PhD student that did a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: inhalation studies because we will have
questions that I cannot answer so please
[SPEAKER_00]: put his name email address down and reach
out to him also if you want the slides
[SPEAKER_00]: they are up on my website I upload them
all on slideshare so you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take as many pictures of those slides then
talking about pictures I don't know why
[SPEAKER_00]: they put this picture of me in there it's
not the best one at least it points out
[SPEAKER_00]: that I like to ride bikes and here these
were the people that took the pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: me and that helped me through this so this
is my current or it's actually my former
[SPEAKER_00]: co-op crop I'm faculty at UBC so I get
access to quite a lot of motivated
[SPEAKER_00]: students that come through my lab on a
four-month basis they do their one of
[SPEAKER_00]: their semesters they have to work for a
real company so I pretend to be a real
[SPEAKER_00]: company I work for me so some of them have
now changed and I have now a new set of
[SPEAKER_00]: people I'd add a statistician to the team
so that we can get our numbers run better
[SPEAKER_00]: and with that thank you very much for
listening and if there any questions I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we have time during the now break
before we all move over and listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl's talk about heavy metals and their
cartridges thank you any questions yes
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah so the question was are there more
compounds you inhale if you smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_00]: versus if you if you vape an oil I would
very much say so yes first there are more
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds initially that you could even
inhale and then using combustion always
[SPEAKER_00]: produces way more compounds down the line
than just vaporizing them so the the one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the studies I showed you was actually
on German material combusted so that would
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a plant thorough and there were
way more compounds they found their versus
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizing and I hope next year I can add
my own data to this oh beneficial compa
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't know generally if they're good
or bad the compound so I can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: answer this then come that actually comes
back more to my expertise of extraction I
[SPEAKER_00]: would say that most extraction artists
don't really know how to extract so they
[SPEAKER_00]: might leave behind a lot of compounds that
should be in the oil so generally I would
[SPEAKER_00]: say the oils you inhale that are available
on the market of lesser quality than they
[SPEAKER_00]: should be if you would in if you would
extract correctly also we all are really
[SPEAKER_00]: happy about the synergistic effect and
then we use distillate so like pick one
[SPEAKER_00]: okay what's the correct extraction so we
are veering off my just presented topic
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are getting to the stuff I really
like so my argument is you have compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: in the starting material and you want to
get all of them out and none of the others
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't want so if you have to clean up
your extract with winterization and
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation you didn't extract correctly
and if you're producing if you if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% yield on a 20% THC flower you also
didn't extract correctly because you left
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot behind or lost it during the process
so that's a short answer
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I lost my slide so yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: so nicotine can't break down into benzene
because there is no benzene moiety in the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule is that not said if there any
other compounds that that could produce
[SPEAKER_00]: benzene that is beyond the reading I've
done I don't know the exact formulations
[SPEAKER_00]: of nicotine based products interesting
aspect but I don't have any answer to that
[SPEAKER_00]: right now there were another question
[SPEAKER_00]: yes yes you have to because
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know I have to admit I don't know
so the reading I did for this presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: and the research was based on like which
compounds come through how they get then
[SPEAKER_00]: bio that goes into a direction that I'm
not really qualified to to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: there is the understanding that the
smaller droplets are faster absorbed again
[SPEAKER_00]: yes I'm hoping to nodding head I think
there was a nodding head so it's I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying I'm trying to hook up a particle
size analyzer to my vape machine right now
[SPEAKER_00]: so that I can actually start doing that
work but we're not there yet
[SPEAKER_00]: so for the study that was the GCMS study
that I showed you yes that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporization because they're putting pure
THC in a comp in a in a tube so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not putting that into a vape cartridge
they only have a milligram of it as I said
[SPEAKER_00]: there are limitations to all these studies
that are currently out there because no
[SPEAKER_00]: one yet has gone to a dispensary border
vape cartridge hooked it up to their
[SPEAKER_00]: personal battery and then put it into a
machine and check that
[SPEAKER_00]: it yeah so I don't know the answer I'm I'm
aware of the question so that that's why I
[SPEAKER_00]: said I want to hook up a particle size
analyzer to the study so ask me next year
[SPEAKER_00]: and I give you some data back
[SPEAKER_02]: did everyone hear this Monica has a loud
voice she was one of the people that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned in the slides because she knows
a lot more about vaping specifically than
[SPEAKER_00]: me I kept ignoring one follow-up question
here on the front do you still want to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: this yes so I had this slide earlier but
there was on nicotine side so heat not
[SPEAKER_00]: burn is exactly that you have flour in a
in a compartment you can either have a
[SPEAKER_00]: prong that sticks into it that's the icos
or you have a like a part like a small jar
[SPEAKER_00]: of ceramic and you put your flour in there
so yes they behave very different to
[SPEAKER_00]: normal nicotine cigarettes as I showed for
the prong size not seen any data on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis itself for that but it's
definitely interesting thing to build and
[SPEAKER_00]: it has already been built if I look in the
right direction so I'm sure packs would be
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to discuss that on their stand at
the expo one quick question on the back I
[SPEAKER_00]: live in Vancouver Canada and just happy
that I'm not in the US so no I like a
[SPEAKER_00]: private research lab will never have the
capability to of figuring out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason for an epidemic is we don't have
access access to enough samples so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't do this what will be our focus is
helping producers in the future to design
[SPEAKER_00]: their vape oils and hardware so that the
inhalation leads to or that at inhalation
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a desirable molecular profile
whatever that will be but figuring out
[SPEAKER_00]: what an epidemic is caused by it can't be
done by a private research lab if they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to send me samples and I look at it
maybe but I leave that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals I don't have a time we all
have to make it to the heavy metal talk so
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you very much again and just find me
in the corridor I'll see what's if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have further questions you
