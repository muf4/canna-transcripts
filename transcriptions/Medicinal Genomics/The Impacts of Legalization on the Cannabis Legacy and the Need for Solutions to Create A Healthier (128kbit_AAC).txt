[SPEAKER_02]: First, I want to thank all of you for
being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of people that are a part of
what we call the legacy project in the
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for supporting your teammates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get out my glasses because
I'm going to get nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we're going to discuss some of the
hurdles the Emerald Triangle legacy
[SPEAKER_02]: operators have faced, the vast collections
of genetics they hold, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions being created to empower both
the operators and the genetic diversity,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how not integrating the knowledge and
the genetics of these legacies impact the
[SPEAKER_02]: future of medicine and science around
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2014, Humboldt County claimed over
10,000 small medical cannabis farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we have less than 1,300 cannabis
licenses in Humboldt and Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_02]: These communities hold over six decades of
experience with breeding, cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: practices, and medicine making around
cannabis, and are being shut out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: new industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new industry that was legalized around
the premise that cannabis is a very
[SPEAKER_02]: diverse medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet as this industry grows and the
legacies get shut out, we are losing vast
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts of important genetics,
research, and experience that can move us
[SPEAKER_02]: all forward towards a healthier future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to introduce to you some of our
legacy project leaders in our panel today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob Golightly at the end over there is the
co-owner of Lost Coast Distribution and a
[SPEAKER_02]: 25-year medical cannabis farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel Hendricks is the co-owner and CEO
of Hendricks Farms, as well as a native of
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff Hamilton is partner at Forella,
Braun, and Martell LLP, and founder of
[SPEAKER_02]: Canopy Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Dale Hunt is senior attorney of
Plant and Planet Law Firm and founder of
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeders Best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff, why don't we just kind of all say a
few things about ourselves and our
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences, and then we'll dive into the
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff, you want to start?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can everyone hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a partner at Forella, Braun,
and Martell in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: I focus on cannabis transactional work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also the founder of a company called
Canopy Right, which is attempting to build
[SPEAKER_04]: a blockchain based botanical registry for
cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I discovered the plant as a teenager.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was sort of like an anxious,
lonely, high-strung kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden, there was this
miracle that made my life better and gave
[SPEAKER_04]: me this opportunity to find
self-confidence and sort of organize my
[SPEAKER_04]: life and really think through my problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as a lawyer, when I got the
opportunity to start working with cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: clients, I just never learned back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I'm focusing on right now is
really the issue that we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about as a group today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Daniel Hendricks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was born in my backyard in Humboldt
County to two Humboldt undergraduate
[SPEAKER_07]: students.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like, symbolically,
I've always followed the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was 1996 when the Compassionate Care
Act passed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a freshman in high school.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I knew that was something that I
really wanted to pursue.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a change in politics and the global
view of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hoped I could be part of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we founded Hendricks Farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a nursery that focuses on
preservation and delivery of powerful and
[SPEAKER_07]: endemic to Humboldt County plants,
and genetics for both home farmers and
[SPEAKER_07]: commercial licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dale?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a plant scientist, did a bachelor's
degree in botany, master's in genetics,
[SPEAKER_06]: PhD in molecular and cellular biology.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I went to law school.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been a patent attorney for 26
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Apologies to people who've heard this
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say it a lot, but it's kind of
necessary, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a patent attorney, I've always worked
with plant breeders in addition to lots of
[SPEAKER_06]: other kinds of inventors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've helped plant breeders protect
their inventions all over the world,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think something like 30 countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've done license deals in about 20
countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen firsthand how companies that
have valuable genetics can scale globally
[SPEAKER_06]: on a really big scale just by licensing
others.
[SPEAKER_06]: To grow their plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that this can be done in the
cannabis industry as world markets open
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got into cannabis about eight years ago,
in a professional sense, and have really
[SPEAKER_06]: enjoyed working with plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite things about my job is
just getting to know the independent plant
[SPEAKER_06]: breeders that have been doing it for
decades.
[SPEAKER_06]: And seeing their passion and seeing their
creative drive and the fact that they put
[SPEAKER_06]: making better plants and better medicines
and helping people way above even making a
[SPEAKER_06]: living.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are doing well and a lot of
them aren't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I started visiting breeders on
their farms, it went from being a really
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting job to being a passion and a
cause.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I started my company, Breeders
Best, in order to help cannabis breeders
[SPEAKER_06]: that couldn't afford to patent their own
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we think that there's something that
really has some potential, then the
[SPEAKER_06]: company will pay for the patenting and in
exchange receives an exclusive license.
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, the breeder always owns the
patent and the license revenues that the
[SPEAKER_06]: company generates go back to the breeder
after obviously it's shared between the
[SPEAKER_06]: breeder and the company.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a lot like a record label where the
breeder is a creative person making
[SPEAKER_06]: something great and they get to focus on
their creative work and they don't have to
[SPEAKER_06]: do all of the other things that lie
between the creation and the revenues.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the job of the company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a huge honor to have some members
of the Breeders Best team here today.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are every bit as passionate as I am
about the plant and about the potential
[SPEAKER_06]: that we have to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go on.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Rob.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: My name's Rob Golightly and I'm a lifelong
cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started collecting signatures for
Proposition 215 in 1993.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been growing cannabis and selling it
legally in California since
[SPEAKER_05]: over-the-counter sales started around
2006.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been aligned with collectives that
were licensed by the City of Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_05]: since around the same time and have
constantly grown different medical strains
[SPEAKER_05]: out of Humble and breeded legacy genetics
from different elders that have been
[SPEAKER_05]: gifted seeds throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: When people pass away and certain things
happen, genetics get passed around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also been a big nursery person too
before Prop 64 came, so I was doing a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of clones in Humble also and picking
specific varieties that would work for
[SPEAKER_05]: good for not just medical reasons,
but also for commercial cultivation so
[SPEAKER_05]: that they could grow large quantities of
it at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a distribution company legally now,
and I also have a legal 10,000 square foot
[SPEAKER_05]: farm in Honeydew, California.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of the first 100 to get
licensed in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Lilenia Dubois, or a lot of
people know me as Lele.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a second generation cannabis
cultivator and community developer in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also the founder of the Humboldt Grace
Legacy Project and CCO of Canopyright.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Humboldt Grace Legacy Project was
formed as a strategy to empower the
[SPEAKER_02]: decades of knowledge around cannabis in
the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who hold this knowledge we call
legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal was to build a pathway forward to
preserve and validate the genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity of these communities reinventing
how the market values the plant and the
[SPEAKER_02]: legacy experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today we're gonna kinda talk about what
are some of the hurdles that's going on
[SPEAKER_02]: with the legacy right now, what are some
of the solutions, and then why does it
[SPEAKER_02]: matter to people who are involved in
medicine and science?
[SPEAKER_02]: So to start you guys, why don't we talk
about what some of the hurdles we've all
[SPEAKER_02]: seen from our different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff, do you wanna start?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna sit down so I don't fall down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I'm happy to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my experience is completely different
than everyone, well, maybe not Dale,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think for me, working with cannabis
clients, you always saw two things on the
[SPEAKER_04]: jar, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the brand name and then there's
the cultivar name.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's always pretty clear to me that
the brands got paid, that made sense,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the cultivar, what is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the person who invented it get paid?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we even know who they are?
[SPEAKER_04]: Could we find out?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is a personal experience sort
of with me and a particular client,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also several clients all with the
exact same problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've got all of these cultivars,
they're really like my most valuable
[SPEAKER_04]: business asset.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't have my seed library,
I wouldn't have gotten all of this
[SPEAKER_04]: investment money, I wouldn't be able to
build my facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're sitting there, you're having
lunch with these clients and this red
[SPEAKER_04]: light goes off in your head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, do you own your cultivars?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you even own your cultivars?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I ended up in this rabbit hole,
but I guess when I'm talking about the
[SPEAKER_04]: hurdles facing the industry right now,
it's that it's really hard to document
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivars in a way that makes sense,
that allows for the people that spent
[SPEAKER_04]: decades developing those cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Including sort of the legacy community to
get paid from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just didn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess that's what I would say is
that the hurdle that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not being valued for their work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not being valued and not even not being
valued, but they're not even being a way
[SPEAKER_04]: to value it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel, anyone?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's lots of hurdles.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the legacy farmer, I would say the
biggest hurdle they have is getting their
[SPEAKER_07]: product to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are several supply chain pieces that
being removed in a remote location,
[SPEAKER_07]: up in the hills, working with
environmentally friendly practices,
[SPEAKER_07]: you have a really long supply chain visit
to get us down to LA.
[SPEAKER_07]: So because of that, they're dependent on
the distribution networks to sell their
[SPEAKER_07]: product to the farmer, to the distribution
company that's going to white label it and
[SPEAKER_07]: create something for the retail customer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to simplify their jobs, the
distribution companies focus on singular
[SPEAKER_07]: metric points.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want high THC, they want purple,
they want certain specific lead terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I see it is really challenging to
motivate yourself to preserve diversity in
[SPEAKER_07]: the cannabis gene pool right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because in order to make a living,
you're forced to kind of follow the
[SPEAKER_07]: pathways that you're given and not being
vertically integrated puts a lot of humble
[SPEAKER_07]: farmers at a disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like it puts the consumer at a
disadvantage, specifically the medical
[SPEAKER_07]: patients and actually reaching the
diversity and the different effects that
[SPEAKER_07]: they want.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do see that access point being a
really big challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see e-commerce and direct
to consumer opportunities develop for the
[SPEAKER_07]: legacy farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll just insert the word heirloom,
because there's something that I feel like
[SPEAKER_07]: legacy might not even communicate what
we're doing here, which is heirloom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you guys go to the grocery store,
you'll probably see heirloom tomatoes that
[SPEAKER_07]: cost more and maybe have a better flavor
profile, different than your commercially
[SPEAKER_07]: bought tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're at the very beginning here in
cannabis where we're trying to hold on to
[SPEAKER_07]: those heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we see the agricultural tools that are
coming in and the monocropping that's
[SPEAKER_07]: coming in is gonna create a period where
the consumer isn't gonna have access to
[SPEAKER_07]: these heirlooms unless they go and value
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with that big separation in between
the farmers that have preserved these
[SPEAKER_07]: heirlooms and the consumer that maybe
doesn't know how the different effects
[SPEAKER_07]: could be curated from these different
profiles, there's just a disconnect there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would be really nice to see the
farmers and the consumers interact again,
[SPEAKER_07]: like actually, sadly before Prop 64,
when people were kind of able to work
[SPEAKER_07]: directly with the grower to get exactly
what they want.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one of the hurdles that I see is
just reaching the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and the science, like what Dr.
Cicely's research, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone mentioned it yesterday,
how the research said that cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't really work that well,
but she didn't really have access to high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: When she came into our community,
she was like, I wish I could study it
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Sue Cicely, she's a great example
because she's so tough in her nature and
[SPEAKER_07]: refuses to follow that path of these kind
of not diluted, but whatever the DEA has
[SPEAKER_07]: in their library, which doesn't reflect
the diversity that people want to interact
[SPEAKER_07]: with when they want to interact with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So good for her for sticking to that point
and kind of refusing to do another study
[SPEAKER_07]: that's really just going to invalidate the
truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dale, Rob, do you have anything to add to
hurdles?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you do, Rob.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was pretty amazing when Sue was
in Humble and she recognized our legacy
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there with you a few years ago and
she really did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I recognize that we are sitting on better
medicine to be running tests and trials
[SPEAKER_05]: with the veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for a legacy farmer, for someone
entering the metric right now and say you
[SPEAKER_05]: were able to pay all the bills and pass
all the stipulations of the regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: process, the biggest problem for a breeder
right now is they're not allowing new
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics into the metric in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so right now the big buzzword with the
DCC was having public comments just a few
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people are upset because they
can't get their genetics into metric.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so yeah, we're pretty much locked out
right now in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also right now in California,
we've reached a point where 70% of all the
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics in the metric right now are
related to each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like Daniel was saying just a
second ago, I go to the collectives every
[SPEAKER_05]: week.
[SPEAKER_05]: We dispense to probably close to 70
collectives and the medical selections for
[SPEAKER_05]: diversity of genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is disgusting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no longer a medical, I don't consider
it medical marijuana anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's become rec marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we lose the different gene pools,
it'll just be becoming more and more rec.
[SPEAKER_05]: And speaking to the trends of it too,
we've watched this purple thing get really
[SPEAKER_05]: trendy where OG was the old trend.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're already seeing the purple trend
fade and we're seeing the OG trend is
[SPEAKER_05]: about to come back in the next few months.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just wild how the market can be
dictated by rappers and fancy commercials.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one other thing that I think has
been a problem for the last few years,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think it's still pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is just the issue of trust.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the old school communities,
I think people, and I wasn't part of them,
[SPEAKER_06]: so I can't pretend to speak for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my observation is that they knew who
they could trust.
[SPEAKER_06]: They trusted their neighbors.
[SPEAKER_06]: They trusted people in their community.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they knew not to trust the government.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they knew they didn't want to deal
with lawyers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't want to deal with big
companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And things have gotten really complicated
because, oh, and they knew not to
[SPEAKER_06]: interact.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't interact much with science and
technology companies somewhat,
[SPEAKER_06]: but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And things have really gotten shaken up
because now, I've heard plenty of stories
[SPEAKER_06]: from readers that have said, yeah,
I gave my friend this particular selection
[SPEAKER_06]: to put in his catalog and I never got
paid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen that a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen that even recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: People just not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_06]: They think they can trust somebody and
then they can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then even more distasteful,
they might have to somehow trust a lawyer
[SPEAKER_06]: or trust the government to get a patent
and to just engage parties they never
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted to engage and to start questioning.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is hard to figure out who you
can trust in this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like to use the word community,
but I think it has, as it's transitioned
[SPEAKER_06]: from community to industry, it's gotten
very confusing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that I have any great
solutions for that, but there are lawyers
[SPEAKER_06]: and companies that are trying to be
trustworthy, but you can't just,
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody tells you, oh, you should trust
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta watch them walk the walk.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can trust me when I say trust
Dale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or when we ask Dale why we shouldn't trust
him and then he answers us in front of a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to preface how I view both of these
attorneys, I think the word activist is
[SPEAKER_07]: synonymous with lawyer when I picture
their identities.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's an important component
that there's an element of activism in
[SPEAKER_07]: genetic preservation in cannabis right now
because there isn't money in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna add one more thing to the hurdles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the money in cannabis at?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is anybody in here making money?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, ask the lawyers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's in the government.
[SPEAKER_06]: They definitely got the taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna add one more thing to the hurdles
and I think that's education.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about genetics and one of
the things that I see as we're building
[SPEAKER_02]: new products and creating all these new
things out of this plant, when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about consumer loyalty and when
we're talking about healing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no L4, L5 in a torn spinal cord and
I really have to understand my medicine to
[SPEAKER_02]: be functionable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And genetics are really important in that
conversation when you're trying to heal
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody or when you're trying to make a
joint that makes people feel a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the gap in that is huge yet these
legacy communities literally have,
[SPEAKER_02]: we know people who have been working with
this plant for six generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so bringing those two together,
I think is gonna help create a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: real medicine too and push the research
forward in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So learning why all this diversity
matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about solutions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Solutions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody else start, these guys,
Jeffrey has a solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am, you know, believe business is
solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be an activist in your
business to try to create solutions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm more on the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm caught in the fight and I think what
Jeff created shows a really good
[SPEAKER_07]: perspective on potential solutions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because protecting your varieties,
you know, somebody holds something that's
[SPEAKER_07]: very special and has unique cannabinoid
profiles that they've worked on for 25
[SPEAKER_07]: generations of the plant's breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that's 25 years, maybe that's 15
years, but extensive work and it's really
[SPEAKER_07]: life's work that people pour into these
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you pour your life's work into
something and then you find yourself
[SPEAKER_07]: outside of the commercial sphere.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to ask yourself how am I going to
get this valuable medicine to somebody and
[SPEAKER_07]: how do I do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's an element of trust that
you have to have a partner that you do
[SPEAKER_07]: trust.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that people are looking for
answers because they are probably evolved
[SPEAKER_07]: now to the point where the right contract
or the right agreements probably look
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty enticing in terms of a way to get
their medicine to reach people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dale and Jeff, have both presented
solutions that, you know, I'd never
[SPEAKER_07]: considered before.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'll let you guys talk about
your agreements and your software,
[SPEAKER_07]: but really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I mean, I wouldn't be sitting
here if I wouldn't have ran into,
[SPEAKER_02]: met Dale and then you came to me because
we have all these amazing people in our
[SPEAKER_02]: community and I'm really a community
builder, but there was no way to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: folks and say, well, you're protected,
especially people like what Daniel's
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, that are shut out of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of breeders with,
I know one breeder in particular who has
[SPEAKER_02]: over 4,000 different cultivars that he's
been seed hunting for 60 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just one person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet he has no income.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jeff came and said, I think I have a
solution and it's this blockchain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and he said something that was also
unique that I want the community's help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the breeders to help me make this
so it really works for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we got started on
understanding that there was a solution
[SPEAKER_02]: that we could start building off of out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, should I start talking now?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in thinking about how cannabis genetic
diversity works, I've always thought about
[SPEAKER_04]: comparing it to music and how the music
industry works.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, when you think about what a
cannabis breeder does when they're
[SPEAKER_04]: developing strains, it's really art and
that cannabis strain is really a work of
[SPEAKER_04]: art.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we could figure out a mechanism for
cannabis breeders to get paid for the
[SPEAKER_04]: commercialization of their cultivars,
like artists get paid for their art,
[SPEAKER_04]: then maybe we could create a fairer system
that resulted in sort of a more equitable
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution of the profits from this
industry, but also gives people an
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity to protect their work.
[SPEAKER_04]: That they've spent decades building.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what we came up with was a system for
doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been working with the Humboldt
Grace Legacy Project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Calls are every Friday at 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did your plug for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyone can come.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyone can come.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the main mechanism is to define a
cannabis cultivar as, in original work,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you have something that you think that
you want to commercialize, you can take a
[SPEAKER_04]: cutting of fresh leaf material,
you can stick it in a tamper evident
[SPEAKER_04]: package with a QR code, and then you can
close the tamper evident package,
[SPEAKER_04]: take a photo of your sample, and you can
keep it in your own freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you think that somebody ripped you
off, you can open up your freezer,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can send your sample to Mike at
medicinal genomics, and you can sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: determine whether or not you got ripped
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the value of having your frozen sample
is, and the value of how we're building it
[SPEAKER_04]: through blockchain is that you can build
out a profile for your cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you want to enter into a
licensing agreement, it's pretty simple to
[SPEAKER_04]: do so.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you think about how the track and
trace system works, you have to put a
[SPEAKER_04]: little tag on every single flowering plant
in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's bad for the environment,
but it's good for inventory control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that the state is making you
do it regardless.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really presents an opportunity to take
this example of licensing cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics like music to another level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you think about a cannabis breeder
as an artist and a cannabis strain like a
[SPEAKER_04]: song, and a cannabis plant like the
equivalent of the play of a song,
[SPEAKER_04]: roughly the same functionality of music
streaming services can be applied to
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, that's what we're building.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working with the Legacy Project,
and that's my story.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Legacy Project, we released a white
paper, I guess, a couple weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're taking is all this
information to show folks how they can not
[SPEAKER_02]: just secure or protect, but how they can
also validate and authenticate their work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're gonna have an auction in
November to really educate not just on the
[SPEAKER_02]: hype, but like show I like to say we're
gonna show everybody's panties,
[SPEAKER_02]: because instead of saying that we're the
best, it's gonna be you're gonna look at
[SPEAKER_02]: this, and you're gonna tell us what you
think through the chemical profiles,
[SPEAKER_02]: through the DNA, through the stories that
the breeders give.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we can start helping folks look at
this plant a little differently and maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: empower the market to come to our
communities instead of asking for how much
[SPEAKER_02]: weed they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll ask, oh, I want a joint that gives
me this kind of experience, or I really
[SPEAKER_02]: need a strain that's high in THCV,
and because of what these communities have
[SPEAKER_02]: been doing for so many generations,
we already know this is going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have to bridge the gap in that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dale, so why does this matter to doctors?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love being here, it's so exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be a part of a science conference,
but why should they listen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should they wanna talk to folks that
are involved or that are from the legacy
[SPEAKER_02]: experience?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tempted to turn about something that
happened yesterday.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was watching my friends back there at
the middle table doing a podcast,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they dragged me onto it to participate
with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the Breeders Best folks,
Nisha Whiteley, Ethan Russo, and Mojave
[SPEAKER_06]: Richmond.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ethan would be the very best person to
answer that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mojave would also give a great answer,
and Nisha wrote a book on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll try to speak for them,
and then I might hear about it if I get it
[SPEAKER_06]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, cannabis is a rich,
rich source of biochemical diversity of
[SPEAKER_06]: different molecules that contact the most
widely distributed receptor system in the
[SPEAKER_06]: body, and it affects pretty much every
function of the body.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you think of that as the
infrastructure for signaling with
[SPEAKER_06]: medicines to get the body to fix itself or
to do something differently, then the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant makes the tools to interact with
this infrastructure and to address all
[SPEAKER_06]: kinds of problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the real beauty of that is,
to use the term that Dr. Russo,
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe, coined and is very fond of,
it is the entourage effect, which I just
[SPEAKER_06]: think of it as synergy between the
interactions of one thing touching a
[SPEAKER_06]: receptor and something else touching a
different receptor or interacting with the
[SPEAKER_06]: same receptor.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get really different and sometimes
extremely elevated activities at the
[SPEAKER_06]: receptor level because of the interaction
of more than one molecule.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's the weakness of single
molecule drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't allow for any synergy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as soon as you have a whole plant
medicine or an extract from a plant and
[SPEAKER_06]: you've got lots of different things that
can interact with that receptor system in
[SPEAKER_06]: a synergistic way, in a cooperative way,
then you've got the potential for
[SPEAKER_06]: incredibly more powerful medicines at
lower doses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's why doctors should be
interested in genetic diversity in
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis because if everything you've got
out there has the same two or three
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes and the same one or two or three
cannabinoids, then you're limiting
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like you walk into a library and
you stop at the first shelf and you pull
[SPEAKER_06]: off the first couple of books and you walk
back out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a huge underutilization of this
vast potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that the genetic diversity,
the biochemical diversity, and the
[SPEAKER_06]: potential that we have with the help of
the great legacy breeders as well as
[SPEAKER_06]: molecular technologies to develop plants
that really can provide new and extremely
[SPEAKER_06]: powerful medicines that are extremely safe
is a promise that is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: revolutionize the health of everybody on
earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ethan might be smiling under his mask.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might be frowning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the different varieties I think are
really important in evaluating your
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine based on the effects.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's something that's just totally
underutilized right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if the consumer really
responds to, okay, either I'm high or I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: not high.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very binary vision of cannabis
and that if you drink a glass of wine
[SPEAKER_07]: versus a glass of beer versus a margarita
or a shot of tequila, you're going to feel
[SPEAKER_07]: different based on those inputs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And cannabis has an even wider range of
effects that it can have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so just to touch on a few,
Ringo's gift, high CBD cultivar,
[SPEAKER_07]: nearly unmarketable in the commercial
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are mothers that say they've heard
their children say mom for the first time
[SPEAKER_07]: in three years by utilizing the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will do anything to make that person
feel better whether there's money involved
[SPEAKER_07]: or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue skunk and orange cream frost.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two cultivars, one bread for PTSD,
the blue skunk, orange cream frost bread
[SPEAKER_07]: for its beauty and its aroma.
[SPEAKER_07]: The orange cream frost will level you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will shut you down.
[SPEAKER_07]: You will stop talking.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll go inside your head and the blue
skunk will make you on a day where you're
[SPEAKER_07]: just having a bad day blow off the thing
that really doesn't matter that is
[SPEAKER_07]: stressing you out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we went to a podcast and the breeder
brought these two herbs and the order was
[SPEAKER_07]: that the podcast interviewer were going to
smoke the two strains and talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They smoked the blue skunk and they had a
great interview and then they smoked the
[SPEAKER_07]: orange cream frost and he went cantatonic.
[SPEAKER_07]: He did not say one thing until the sound
engineer just shut it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's over.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the power of those genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you choose the really purple flashy
one, you might get leveled when you really
[SPEAKER_07]: want the bright green one that's going to
make you feel really good for the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then to touch on one more and the
cannabinoids, and the minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_07]: is pink blue scottis where it is
documented as the highest THCV.
[SPEAKER_07]: So tetrahydrocannabin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I got that right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a rare cannabinoid that some labs
can't even distinguish between THC and
[SPEAKER_07]: THCV.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we might be missing the whole point
when we look at, oh, this thing's got 22%.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have 10% and 7% THCV.
[SPEAKER_07]: And 2% THCP, which there are still
undiscovered cannabinoids here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the diversity and the preservation is
super important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the doctor should be looking at the
necessity of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a data bank or a bank where all
these genetics exist.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we should be inviting the home growers
to pull all the seeds out of their
[SPEAKER_07]: forbidden closets and preserve these
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will go further to say it shouldn't
be any government entity that holds those
[SPEAKER_07]: data banks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be the community that holds
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, I know you got some stuff to add.
[SPEAKER_05]: Following up with Dan, the cannabis plant
is the only plant on earth that holds
[SPEAKER_05]: every single terpene profile on earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that there's a huge
research to do with just the variances of
[SPEAKER_05]: all the different terpenes that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And definitely we're going to find
terpenes that are might only have 100
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds left that represent that terpene
profile at somebody's house that was
[SPEAKER_05]: growing it 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And definitely locking our data into
blockchain is a way to preserve this
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that I had a friend that's
been doing NFTs for almost four years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was telling me that I should try to
find out something that can connect with
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was easily the first thing I
figured out was we could lock our DNA
[SPEAKER_05]: codes into the blockchain so that we can't
get them stolen and we can claim them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no one else can ever claim them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then second, I had the idea that if we
could create contracts just for selling
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis so that we could control
circumvention in the metric and create
[SPEAKER_05]: contracts that we could read the metric.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure enough, somebody in our group
created a smart contract before I could
[SPEAKER_05]: get a hold of my coder friend to tell him
to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a contract that can read
metric, which I think is really invaluable
[SPEAKER_05]: to small cultivators to make sure that we
can watch and track where our things are
[SPEAKER_05]: and make sure people don't steal them and
take them a ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thanks you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have any questions of anybody
on the panel up here?
Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Eric.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they can record it, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, do the mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for being down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, I was wondering if you
could actually just run through what the
[SPEAKER_03]: parts of a transaction, what that would
look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody sees a cultivar, they're
interested, a client.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you just sort of go through an
analogy of what that looks like and the
[SPEAKER_03]: different pieces, how that comes together?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how it's happening now or through
Canopy Right, what we've developed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, through your, I guess it's still in
beta, so I don't think it's operating at
[SPEAKER_03]: this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it does launch, how would that
look?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like somebody licensing, what would that
look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Canopy Right is the engine is built and
now the 2.0 design is coming out thanks to
[SPEAKER_02]: Kelsey, so it's really user friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you want to answer that,
Josh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll answer that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the way that it works isn't dissimilar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's similar to how it works now except
for one important change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the way that it works is if a grower
wants to grow a cultivar from a breeder,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have them negotiate a price on a per
plant basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once there's an agreement and there's
a mechanism for negotiation, the
[SPEAKER_04]: negotiation follows a few different paths.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one is the price per plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we invoice based on the flowering
plant tags that are on each plant when
[SPEAKER_04]: they're entered into the traction tray
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's really only one aspect of a
transaction, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're not just buying a plant,
you're also buying how you grow that
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we sort of create a space for
people to input cultivation requirements,
[SPEAKER_04]: quality standards, late fees, it's not
just what you're charging per plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's what you're charging per plant to get
the cultivar that the breeder wants to be
[SPEAKER_04]: in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once that happens, when the cultivars
flowering plants are entered into the
[SPEAKER_04]: track and trace system, we pull that data
and then we generate an invoice based on
[SPEAKER_04]: the agreed upon price per plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are tracking it periodically and then
we invoice on a monthly basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the basic mechanism, but I think it
probably helps to talk about the privacy
[SPEAKER_04]: aspects of it because I think that that's
a thing that is a problem in the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: right now is if you, there's a lot of
trust issues and also there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Rob was talking about it,
but everyone has a story of how they've
[SPEAKER_04]: been ripped off and so we want to just
create a system that is completely private
[SPEAKER_04]: if users want it to be private.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I could just, I am often asked
about the difference between Canopy Right
[SPEAKER_06]: and patents and I think it's helpful to
explain the two because I think they're
[SPEAKER_06]: really compatible and I am a big supporter
of Canopy Right even though I'm a patent
[SPEAKER_06]: attorney.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things people ask me is,
is my plant new enough to patent?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it different enough that I can get a
patent on it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the answer is if you bred it,
it is different enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll qualify for a patent, we can get you
a patent.
[SPEAKER_06]: The real question that you should be
asking instead is, is this plant worth
[SPEAKER_06]: patenting because there's no super
inexpensive way to patent it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to cost you, by the time you're
finished, it's going to cost at least
[SPEAKER_06]: $10,000 and maybe closer to $30,000 to get
it patented.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now if you've got something that's going
to take the world by storm and it'll be
[SPEAKER_06]: commercially viable for a decade or two,
then that's just a rounding error on the
[SPEAKER_06]: rounding error.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be a significant amount
of the value of that plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are a lot of things that people
want to be able to commercialize without
[SPEAKER_06]: hiring a lawyer, without spending that
kind of money, and with extremely quick,
[SPEAKER_06]: efficient transactions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what I love about Canopy Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It lets people skip the whole lawyer thing
and go straight into commercial
[SPEAKER_06]: transactions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Canopy Right notifies them that,
okay, look, as soon as you do a
[SPEAKER_06]: transaction, you are starting a patent
deadline for yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to, if you want to get a patent
on this, you need to act within a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so these are not, these are systems
that I think are very compatible and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: a great solution for people who don't want
to spend the money on a patent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then another solution for people who
don't want to spend the money on a patent
[SPEAKER_06]: is Breeders Best because we pay for the
patent work, the breeder owns it,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we have to be pretty selective.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't protect nearly as many cultivars
as Canopy Right can handle because there
[SPEAKER_06]: is so much cost associated with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's only when we think, we see
something that we think we could put all
[SPEAKER_06]: over the world and really have an impact
for a long time, that that's when we say,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, yeah, we'll commit to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll spend the money on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with confidence that it will end up
producing enough revenues that the breeder
[SPEAKER_06]: can really benefit from it and that we can
recoup our investment in it as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are different systems,
but I think they're highly compatible and
[SPEAKER_06]: it opens up a form of protection to a lot
more plant varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last thing I would say is,
just full disclosure, the registration
[SPEAKER_04]: functionality we're not charging for and
we will never charge for.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just an essential service that we
think that we're gonna be providing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna charge a royalty fee when
people enter into business transactions
[SPEAKER_04]: with each other because we wrote your
contract for you and I'm a lawyer,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are trying to offer the system of
creating a registration of a cultivar and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're trying to do it for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just the model that they're
discussing, I mean, our business has used
[SPEAKER_07]: that exact licensing model since its
inception to economically empower
[SPEAKER_07]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_07]: So things like the blueberry muffin and
other varieties were curated with these
[SPEAKER_07]: concepts at the very beginning that we
didn't want to share that without
[SPEAKER_07]: empowering the breeder.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that it's a great first step
to initiate asserting your value over your
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics is to put them into Canopyright
and say, I'm gonna take the first step to
[SPEAKER_07]: acknowledge the value here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also wanna say how cool it is that
they use the tampering proof bags,
[SPEAKER_07]: which are kind of like an evidence police
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just think the irony there is really
awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So great design.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and like Daniel kind of mentioned,
the whole licensing agreement idea isn't a
[SPEAKER_02]: new concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't very accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what Jeff has created has made it
accessible so we can build on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Evian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I believe the gentleman over here
had a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think she had a question maybe
even before, so I would make sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with them, so you could go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for being the last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that you all and the other
talks this week have done a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: job of highlighting that the medical
benefits of cannabis are probably really
[SPEAKER_00]: come from having this diversity in the
cultivars and having many terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: different profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even from the adult use perspective,
I think that's really important in
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the different effects that the
consumer might be looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, there's this huge
proliferation of synthetically derived
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids like Delta-Ade and HHC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, those are being driven from
a certain economic perspective and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that cannabis is illegal in many
places, so it's convenient to then gain
[SPEAKER_00]: access to something that will get you high
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I heard of someone yesterday,
and I've heard at many other conferences,
[SPEAKER_00]: that people think that the biosynthetic
derived from yeast or, again, these
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory-derived cannabinoids are
perhaps a huge player in the future of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they seem to be pretty threatening to
trying to maintain this diversity that is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually relevant to medicine and to
again, consumer satisfaction, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wondered what all your thoughts
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they really have a place in the future
of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they do, how does it all balance
out so that we don't lose what you are all
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to preserve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone want to take that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, my brief research into Delta-Ade
and the other cannabinoids definitely is
[SPEAKER_05]: because they're not letting THC across
state borders.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have plenty of THC to serve people
across the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have seen that there's research that
shows that it does do combinations with
[SPEAKER_05]: THC, and people do get good effects from
taking Delta-Ade with THC added.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's actually, there's brands in
the metric market in California now that
[SPEAKER_05]: have been adding Delta-Ade in the last six
months to a year that I've noticed coming
[SPEAKER_05]: out online.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's definitely being used in
California even.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from a patient's perspective,
you know, I've always said whatever works,
[SPEAKER_02]: but what I've learned over the years,
and I've watched us as we're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: closer and closer to more, I was raised by
a midwife and she was very much a
[SPEAKER_02]: naturopath in the way she took care of her
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really, I was a nurse and I really
thought science knew everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I saw, what I've seen the past
two days is that science is starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: validate what indigenous studies,
indigenous medicines and plants and plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines is known for centuries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just haven't had the tools to define
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see science defining those things,
not really changing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe this plant will help us realize
that we don't need all those chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: things and that plant medicine might have
a little more power than we've given it
[SPEAKER_02]: credit to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to just hear if you could,
if the panel could speak to the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: the Ethical Data Alliance has been doing
for the past two and a half years and how
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these projects kind of tie together
with that and the Eden protocol with the
[SPEAKER_01]: blockchain and just how it's a kind of a
gift back to the community and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: ethical gatekeeper of everything that
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just met the Ethica Data Alliance
about, I don't know, eight months ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm very familiar with Philos and all
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dale actually, Dale and I ran,
I went to a meeting that Dale was at and I
[SPEAKER_02]: was actually invited to meet Dale about
four years ago before COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh no, I can't go there
because my community won't trust me,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got invited to a small group
meeting and I was able to ask him,
[SPEAKER_02]: you seem great, I appreciate what you have
to say, but why am I told that maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: you're the big bad devil trying to steal
all our genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gave me a really good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he saw what some of us,
Daniel and I have been talking about for
[SPEAKER_02]: quite a few years, is creating this
auction and how it could tell a story and
[SPEAKER_02]: help empower these small farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, Leile, I wanna help you out
and I'm gonna be your pro bono attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, you need to go into the EDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not a technologist, I'm not a
breeder, I am a cultivator, I know the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant very well and I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I am is a community builder and I
didn't know much about blockchains and I
[SPEAKER_02]: went into the EDA and I just said,
look, you guys, I'm told that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to protect our IP, here's what I
think I'd like to do, help and really
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly, Jeff came to the table,
another gentleman, Caleb came to the
[SPEAKER_02]: table, another gentleman, Jason with
Paulscore came to the table and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: look, we have these, we think we have
solutions and the Ethica Data Alliance is
[SPEAKER_02]: really like the mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see them as the mothership helping this
entire industry preserve and protect their
[SPEAKER_02]: IP through all these technologies and
helping us through the Humboldt Grace
[SPEAKER_02]: Legacy Project, because we're really about
community and the plant ensure that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the right thing through these
technologies and through our communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're really a really great
resource, I think, for anybody in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry who is looking at innovative ways
to use blockchain and crypto technologies
[SPEAKER_02]: to empower themselves and their
communities in more ways than genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely is an amazing organization
and we would not be where we are right now
[SPEAKER_02]: and this project is like going like
wildflower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Locally, we have a lot of support and I
mean, we just would not be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not know Jeff and now I have the
pleasure of working with Jeff with
[SPEAKER_02]: Canopyright if it was not for the EDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please, if you think you have IP that
you need to preserve and protect,
[SPEAKER_02]: go to their meetings because that's what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else wanna add to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you two are on the board.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a donation button on the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a non-profit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one paid person on the EDA and he
works really hard and we need that
[SPEAKER_06]: funding.
[SPEAKER_06]: So please, any donation, large or small,
would be greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the EDA for me is the network that
has brought us all together, absolutely,
[SPEAKER_07]: that I met Dale in 2019 here at CanMed
after a really inspiring panel that he
[SPEAKER_07]: gave and I was fortunate enough to speak
as well and we connected and the EDA kept
[SPEAKER_07]: us together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ethical Data Alliance is my favorite
group of cannabis nerds that care about
[SPEAKER_07]: the good guys and the little guys and it
was formed in the wake of kind of some
[SPEAKER_07]: nefarious acts by a well-known cannabis
DNA sequence collecting company,
[SPEAKER_07]: not medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna also add another reason that we're
at this stage and here today is because of
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brendan, Kevin and Mike have been at our
Friday calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I don't think they've missed one
of our Friday calls as medicinal genomics
[SPEAKER_02]: and have been really supportive and I
wanna thank you guys for inviting us here
[SPEAKER_02]: to have this call.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you everyone for coming up for
us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
