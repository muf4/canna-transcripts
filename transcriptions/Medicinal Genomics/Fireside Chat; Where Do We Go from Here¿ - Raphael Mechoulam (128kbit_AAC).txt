[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have these microphones on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everyone hear us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay, there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love microbes.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were just chatting, and I
mentioned that the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a certain extent, particularly through
the CB2 receptor, is a protective system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things that we have
protect ourselves is tolerance of microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: to antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, our body and microbes have been
talking to each other for millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: years, and chances are that the body
attacks microbes, or at least certain
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, and microbes respond by taking
protective measures, and then the body
[SPEAKER_00]: tries to find ways to overcome the
protective measures, and it goes back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as obviously, at the moment,
one of the major problems in medicine is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do we do with this tolerance of
microbes to antibiotics?
[SPEAKER_00]: If things do not change, and seriously
change, within 10 years, we may not have
[SPEAKER_00]: any real antibiotics around a situation
which is extremely dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have the endocannabinoid system,
so we thought, let's see whether the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system is somewhat
involved in that kind of conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: between microbes and the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have something on the fireside
chat which is not immediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes somewhere, oops, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we go one back?
[SPEAKER_01]: The red one will go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the laser is the green one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we speak to each other by making
noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it talking, chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chatting, if you wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes talk to each other by releasing
chemicals, and when microbes are in
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, they start excreting chemicals,
selling other microbes, not one or two,
[SPEAKER_00]: but millions of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do something, and this is called
quorum sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why it's called quorum sensing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea, but that's what it's
called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ways they protect
themselves, they come together and form a
biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quorum sensing, as you can read,
is the ability of bacterial population to
[SPEAKER_00]: chemically communicate with each other,
and one of the ways bacteria protect
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves from stress, and antibiotics
for them, obviously, stress, they make
[SPEAKER_00]: biofilms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biofilms of millions of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The antibiotics cannot go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the biofilm, the microbes do not
develop, and if they do not develop,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the antibiotics, anyway, do not act
on them so long, and they sit there and
[SPEAKER_00]: wait until they can do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the ways microbes
protect themselves against the stress of
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way of tolerance, if you wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we thought if we have an
endocannabinoid system, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: protective system, does it do something?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my colleague, one of my colleagues,
who knows how to do these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't got the foggiest idea how to
work with these things, we gave him an
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely potent synthetic cannabinoid,
which is very potent, both on CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought, well, maybe we should take
something very potent, see whether it
[SPEAKER_00]: acts, and then we go to CBDTHC
endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endocannabinoids and so on, this is a
compound called HU210, which is about 100
[SPEAKER_00]: times more active than THC, and wanted to
see whether it affects the microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yes, we reduced the formation of
biofilms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also reduced the formation of viral
factor production by these particular
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going on, with other microbes,
we're going on in other forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: protection, but it seems that the
endocannabinoid system, at least this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the first evidence, I hope this is not the
last evidence, that the cannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: interferes with the signal transduction
used by bacteria, by the protection of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria against stress, which means that
maybe, just maybe, in a couple of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics will be administered together
with endocannabinoids, or particular
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid, to reduce the tolerance
of bacteria to antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall we be there someday?
[SPEAKER_00]: I sincerely hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways to go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find out in three years' time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just before we jump onto the next
topic, I find it interesting that there
[SPEAKER_01]: are some class of antibiotics known as
aminoglycosides that act specifically on
[SPEAKER_01]: the mitochondria, and we even have some
patients that when there's a mutation in
[SPEAKER_01]: the mitochondria, aminoglycosides can
actually induce a form of hearing loss
[SPEAKER_01]: because of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it possible that the cannabinoids
are working through a different mechanism
[SPEAKER_01]: for their quorum sensing, or dissolving of
quorum sensing, or what do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we know about its mode of action
in the microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, quite frankly, we don't know
anything at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first evidence we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to the microbiologist,
and they have never heard of
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, microbiologists don't know of
the existence of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look at me and say, oh,
really?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes sense that our body has a
defense mechanism against something that
[SPEAKER_00]: is normally occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria sense that the body is fighting
against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's a synthetic compound or
a semi-synthetic compound that we give,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's attacking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't seem to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that the body is attacking them,
and this is their reaction, making a
[SPEAKER_00]: biofilm, making other things, making a
biofilm to protect themselves against
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to learn a huge amount of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it could be cytokine-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do tend to get cytokine storms when
there's inflammation, and it seems as if
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabinoids are having some role in
dampening down that inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, I think, some talks today on PANS
and PANDAS where we see this happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: pediatric patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a lot more sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know that cannabinoids,
some cannabinoids, endocannabinoids most
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely act on cytokines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type and other type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the cytokines, we published quite
a bit on that, and most definitely they
[SPEAKER_00]: act on the cytokines.
[SPEAKER_00]: How relevant that is to what I was telling
you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't got the focus yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on the sense of bone remodeling,
our mother recently broke her leg in six
[SPEAKER_01]: places, and so we've been paying a lot of
attention to your work here in osteoclast
[SPEAKER_01]: and osteoblast development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this started from a completely
different research we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had nothing to do with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were papers and statistics that
women, after the age of 50, when there are
[SPEAKER_00]: hormonal changes, women have much less
osteoporosis in the Mediterranean region
[SPEAKER_00]: than, let's say, Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that, people said,
was olive oil, we thought, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: olive oil, and all of them use only olive
oil, so we thought, okay, let's look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the oleic acid, which is the principle of
olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing to do with cannabinoids at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at olive oil, and my friend Itai
Bab, who is a specialist in bones,
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't find anything, so we didn't throw
it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, maybe it's a metabolite of
oleic acid, so we looked at what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite these acids make, and one of
them, we thought maybe, for all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons, I wouldn't go into that,
fatty acid bound to amino acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we made oleic acid bound to serine,
an amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this now brings us closer to
endocannabinoids because the endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are compounds of that type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fatty acid bound to an amino acid or a
derivative of an amino acid, so we are now
[SPEAKER_00]: closer, all of a sudden, to
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to go away from endocannabinoids,
so we looked at this particular compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: oleic serine, or OS, and we found that it
is present in bone, and Itai Bab found
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is extremely potent against
osteoporosis, and so why did we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: oleic serine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those of you who remember your
chemistry, this is anandamide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there is
[SPEAKER_00]: oleic serine on the top, and our hedonoyl
serine, which is close to anandamide,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera, and at the end,
following this particular line of thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have oleic serine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was published five years ago in
Proceedings of National Academy of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences, and this particular compound,
oleic serine, turned out to be extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: potent in bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It enhances the activity of cells that
produce bones, and here we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see going up and down,
and it lowers the activity of the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: that destroy bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's fine, but does it work in
osteoporosis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took poor mice, we took away the
reproductive system, which essentially is
[SPEAKER_00]: what is happening in women after the age
of 50, not exactly, but more or less,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they don't have the hormones,
and these mice, after a few months,
[SPEAKER_00]: develop osteoporosis like women after the
age of 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, if you look at the red on the
slide, you'll see that the bone volume
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we started getting them
oleic serine, and lo and behold,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw, now that it stops the reaction,
it also moves it up, so the bones start
[SPEAKER_00]: being formed again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have an endocannabinoid-like
compound, which works in a direction which
[SPEAKER_00]: we couldn't even think about at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is something that we have to
take into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 150 compounds of this type
in our body, in our brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to an antibody,
which acts on the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have an additional 150 compounds,
or even more, of this type,
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid-like compounds,
and a few of those only, very few,
[SPEAKER_00]: have been looked into, so we can expect a
huge amount of things happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: of which, at the moment, I can only guess
what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: One speculation, if you wish, has to do
with psychology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to some of our psychology and asked
them, what do we know about biochemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: of individual differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I different than anybody else here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a couple hundred people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of us is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we different?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the chemistry?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we haven't got the foggiest
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, is it possible, then, I said,
that because we have 150 or maybe 200
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds of this type,
endocannabinoid-like compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: those that we have looked into seem to act
on the central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible that the relations of these
150 compounds have something to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: our personality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he said, I have nothing against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, maybe, our personality,
to a certain extent, is based genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: on the 150 to 200 anandamide-like
compounds that we have in our brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the relations between them will show
someday that they are the basis,
[SPEAKER_00]: or one of the basis, of personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complete speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody comes up and says, oh,
that is silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody tells me that I'm
hard-headed, it's because these things are
[SPEAKER_01]: affecting my brain and the bones around my
brain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like me to tell another short
story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do cannabinoids act on so many things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: One possibility is they have or at least
cannabidiol has, anandamide has,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to act through epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is epigenetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the effect on DNA without breaking
it, just modifying the activity of DNA by
[SPEAKER_00]: methylated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say a part of the DNA that's
involved in a certain reaction and causes
[SPEAKER_00]: the production of peptides or proteins
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And works overtime, and this working
overtime causes a reaction, causes a
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we block the activity, it can lower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was shown by an Italian group
that cannabidiol and anandamide can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that in a particular skin disease,
psoriasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is a general reaction,
then it may explain why cannabinoids have
[SPEAKER_00]: such a wide type of reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, just maybe, cannabinoids not only
in that particular skin reaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe in other diseases causes changes
in the DNA epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're asking me, where are we going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here are some speculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may be completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an interesting model from memory
in a model organism called aplasia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did some sequencing in this before,
because it's the largest single cell
[SPEAKER_01]: neuron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the genome copy number in this is like
100,000 throughout the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in sequencing it, there's a very
interesting connection with 5-HT,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is serotonin, and methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could actually sample different
areas of this single cell when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to form, we believe, memories and
see different patterns of methylation and
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA moving around at a single cell level,
which is really fascinating if these
[SPEAKER_01]: govern everything in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's an endocannabinoid
system in aplasia, but I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: home and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we're speaking of
endocannabinoids or not, I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: several things in my lecture just passing
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is we need clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about that for quite a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I repeat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't go ahead without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second thing is we need to look at the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published on the entourage effect 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been no research on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many other people should work on the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is not the same as cannabis with some
other compounds there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know whether THC with CBD is
better for heart disease, heart
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard from the clinicians that,
yes, we need more CBD, less CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the disease, depends on the
age, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know so very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third thing that we have,
there are many other things that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to know, but another thing that we have to
know is what are these endogenous-like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned now the possibility that they
have to do with protection against
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many other things, but let me
end on a positive note.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lysozymes, which are present in
many animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cellular organelles that have
function by digestion and recycling of
[SPEAKER_00]: macromolecules, proteins, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, somebody looked at the lysozymes in a
worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a worm called C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people that work on longevity work on
C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the worm, C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans, lives only a few months,
I think, and it's easy to work on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, working with a human being on
longevity, well, we don't have the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But working on a worm lives just a very
short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost all people that work on
longevity work on the worm, C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a very recent paper just a few
months ago, it was found that this part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell, the lysozyme, takes proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the compounds that under
certain condition it can make is an
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid-like compound called
olehylethanolamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may remember I just was speaking of
olehyl serine that has to do with bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the worm, C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans, makes olehylethanolamide,
which again is an endocannabinoid-like
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, this
endocannabinoid-like compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: through a certain mechanism that they
found, this was published in Science,
[SPEAKER_00]: activates certain genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activates the transcription of genes of
NH80, and promotes longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next idea is, well, maybe as of
tomorrow morning, each one of us should
[SPEAKER_00]: take a spoonlet of olehylethanolamide and
live to be 120 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some worms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is beyond speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just to end on a happy note.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: with all of that, we would like to turn
some time here to present Dr. Murchulam
[SPEAKER_01]: with a Lifetime Achievement Award.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our sign of appreciation for the
cascade and the avalanche that he has
[SPEAKER_01]: created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's something attached to this
award that's not very transparent or
[SPEAKER_01]: apparent from what Brendan's holding.
[SPEAKER_01]: This award is actually represents a one
trillion base pair award.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are going to offer up a trillion
bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that with a pinky by my thumb or
pinky by my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: To Dr. Murchulam to sequence whatever he
wants to sort of better expand this space
[SPEAKER_01]: and to understand whether it's gene
expression or methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you very much indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so very thrilled to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one million megabases or 1,000
gigabases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we encourage everybody to tweet or
email their ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We by no means understand all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to crowd source the best solution
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
