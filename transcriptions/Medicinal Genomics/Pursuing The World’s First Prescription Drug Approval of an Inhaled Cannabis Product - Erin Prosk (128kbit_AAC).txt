[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thanks everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that introduction as well,
which to what is my ultimate mission,
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring you all to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to recruit you, where we can do a
little bit, we have a little bit easier
[SPEAKER_00]: access to early phases of research in
cannabis-based medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here to represent my organization,
Sante Cannabis, our team of, our small
[SPEAKER_00]: team here that contributed to this work,
but our larger team back home in Montreal,
Quebec.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some disclosures I'm going to
present about what is an investigational
[SPEAKER_00]: drug, which is owned by sponsor Tetra
Biopharma, and some work that was done at
[SPEAKER_00]: a large CRO, North American CRO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've heard, we've talked a bit about
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some excitement happening,
both with the introduction of the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Act last week, which legalized cannabis
for adult use, but we have a proliferation
[SPEAKER_00]: of licensed producers and manufacturers of
products in Canada that are regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have access to the machine of
regulatory investigational processes that
[SPEAKER_00]: allow the development of cannabis-based
drugs governed by the same division that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks at other, the development of other
pharmaceutical medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have with the Cannabis Act,
a lot of opportunity for smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators, processors, manufacturers to
get into the game, as there is now an
[SPEAKER_00]: inclusive framework for different sizes of
production and facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Cannabis Act as well,
we saw a streamlining of access to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products for research purposes,
and this should make working in this field
[SPEAKER_00]: much easier moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have really a huge revolution
happening though.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of cannabis dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the hype around, you know,
how much of a change this is on the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: level isn't really founded because we've
had gray area dispensaries, hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: them operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a shift for those of us
who've been working in this field for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time to suddenly see these
dispensaries having closing out sales in
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation for what our government
suppliers to take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Ontario retailer here in
our largest province, and quotes on
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter just astounded by the interest in
their products, which we all know very
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis means medicine in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we have a lot of the same
opportunities and challenges that you see
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but importantly if we look at a lot
of the challenges over here, we decide
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can look at these access,
access to information, research,
[SPEAKER_00]: education, training, stigmatization,
and take the focus on the opportunity of
[SPEAKER_00]: developing research products and
investigational drugs to address this long
[SPEAKER_00]: list of challenges that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings us to our mission at Sante
Cannabis, where we exist in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sante, very important for you to know,
means health in French.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to translate to quite a few
Americans this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we facilitate a series of clinics
across the province where we're supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: patient access to physicians and our
nursing team for support, education,
[SPEAKER_00]: and treatment plans, but we're also
collecting a huge battery of different
[SPEAKER_00]: research outcomes and outcome measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do that, it does involve quite a few
different people, but this is a glimpse at
[SPEAKER_00]: our clinic and research model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we initiate with a referral from a
physician treating the patient in primary
[SPEAKER_00]: care, and then run that through our system
to initiate the patient into our research
[SPEAKER_00]: database.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient will be seen in person at the
clinic by a nurse who will do a complete
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment and be able to collect a huge
list of baseline data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nurse works together with the
physician to implement the treatment plan
[SPEAKER_00]: for that patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then critically, we have our core of
our team, the nurse educators who provide
[SPEAKER_00]: education, follow-up, support,
modification of dosages, and product
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all adhering to a
physician-standardized treatment plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is then we're able to
take that experiential data, observational
[SPEAKER_00]: data, which we're collecting from the
patient and take that over to pharma
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsors, small biotech companies,
experts in drug development who are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for keys to their development,
and start to initiate a process where we
[SPEAKER_00]: can develop cannabis-based drugs in
parallel with our work at the clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we know, there's a very complexity
of treatment options.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more than 100 producers in Canada,
each producing between 10 and 50 different
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this translates into a huge number of
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start to then categorize the products
that are available into different
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations of THC, CBD, and try to
collect as much data as possible about
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we make decisions around route of
administration selection, primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: between inhalation and oral, which is what
we have available in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we dig into the patient use
patterns at the clinic, we still see that
[SPEAKER_00]: we are in a transitionary phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in methods of administration,
while oil or oral administration has been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in popularity and is now our most
common method of use, we see a still a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of inhalation, which has been persistent
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more than 50% of patients are using
inhalation in some form, whether
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated with oil or on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that category of inhalation,
we still see a very persistent population
[SPEAKER_00]: that is insistent on smoking as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vaporization has been growing,
but even patients who have a vaporizer
[SPEAKER_00]: often report that smoking can be more
effective for them and are often using the
[SPEAKER_00]: two in tandem or in a kind of mixed model
of inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this drives this question, what is
going on with this smoking and why
[SPEAKER_00]: patients are still reporting such a
difference between vaporization and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking administrations?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big question of inhalation is then,
you know, is it necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all of these other methods that
are developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially here in California and other U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: states where you have topical creams,
sublingual sprays, patches, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but we still see this persistent
desire for inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if we think about specific
symptom categories such as breakthrough
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, nausea, vomiting, appetite
stimulation, and the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: substitution as well of problematic
substances of abuse, this kind of rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: onset of inhalation is thought to be very
critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we think about the onset and ongoing
development of inhalation as a method of
[SPEAKER_00]: administration, it's our goal to really go
back and look at the root of the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inhalation methods, though we have a
lot of information that has been published
[SPEAKER_00]: about their in vitro results, such as
using an artificial lung, analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: components in the smoke or the vapor,
we don't have enough information about the
[SPEAKER_00]: inhuman response to these different
methods of administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this brought us to work with the
sponsor I'm highlighting here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the product that was developed for
analysis and comparison between smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: administration and vaporized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's named as the Investigational Drug
PPP001, active pharmaceutical ingredient,
[SPEAKER_00]: both THC and CBD in a specific ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this product is standardized as a blend
of three different strains of dried
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis at a dosage of 280 milligrams of
whole plant material and standardized to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a dosage of 25 milligrams THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 5.5 milligrams of CBD per pellet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the placebo, we have zero THC and
a small fraction of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objective of this first study,
which I'll present today is to evaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: the safety and tolerability of this fixed
dose in an inhaled or smoked THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: administration over one day and then over
seven consecutive days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The methods involve a kind of clear
standard process for a phase one,
[SPEAKER_00]: double blind, placebo controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be looking at single and multiple
daily doses in both of those cohorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So importantly, this was a very popular
study and recruitment because subjects
[SPEAKER_00]: were confined for monitoring during the
entire duration of the period and for 36
[SPEAKER_00]: hours pre and post.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it involved a lot of video games and
being paid quite well for that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was approved according to standard
procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking really primarily at
safety outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vital signs ECG was done at various
time points, physical exam and a battery
[SPEAKER_00]: of clinical laboratory tests to look at
different safety outcomes, including a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard process for cognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The device that was used as an inhalation
device approved actually in Canada as a
[SPEAKER_00]: class two medical device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a titanium pipe, which can be used to
smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a standardized controlled
inhalation to try to get as close as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to a standardized dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very carefully instructed to
inhale for three seconds, hold for three
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds, exhale and repeat the process for
as many inhalations as required to
[SPEAKER_00]: complete the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first cohort, these patients
were looked at were divided into a group
[SPEAKER_00]: of groups of eight subjects and dosage was
first just once daily for one day and then
[SPEAKER_00]: moving to twice and three times a day with
the same product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that safety data would be analyzed
before proceeding to the second cohort,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would essentially progress through
that same process over a seven day period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So importantly in the demographics,
we had a pretty good range of age from 25
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to 60 years old,
primarily 60% male and primarily Caucasian
[SPEAKER_00]: average BMI and pretty standard other
measures of health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the pharmacokinetics,
this is where things start to get really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting when we look at smoked
administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had THC and CBD detectable in the first
blood draw one minute after inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most subjects, this remained for
about three hours, though many of them had
[SPEAKER_00]: almost complete elimination after one hour
post administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maximum concentration or C max was
very variable, even with the very
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized methods of inhalation that we
employed with a maximum concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 all the way to 180 nanograms per ml.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, 180 is something that's very rarely
observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's one report of such
concentration in a clinical study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we see 50 to 60 nanogram per ml as
a C max in vaporization studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the maximum time on average was five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the peak plasma level occurring
at five minutes post administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this cohort, we didn't see any
accumulation effect at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the next dose was administered,
there was complete elimination of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and the metabolite alpha 11 hydroxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also didn't see any steady state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in pharmacodynamics, we can see that
there's an impaired cognition actually
[SPEAKER_00]: after the first administration,
but that this actually resolved as we were
[SPEAKER_00]: administering further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw some development of tolerance,
though in this small population,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be difficult to make large
estimates of that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also saw some limitations that we
weren't looking for functional impairment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just a standard impairment,
small sample size, and I'm not sure yet
[SPEAKER_00]: about clinical significance until we move
to our next round of studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that's very interesting in
the data is if we look exactly at these
[SPEAKER_00]: different subjects, so this safety effect,
the safety report actually stopped the
[SPEAKER_00]: study periodically, a severe adverse
reaction in two moderate ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: which involved the subject fainting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this was a 52 year old Caucasian
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd been exposed to cannabis in the
past, so was used to the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd expect her to have a very high
concentration in her blood, but actually
[SPEAKER_00]: she was below average with just a 52
nanogram per ml.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really showing the difference
between subjects and how this response can
[SPEAKER_00]: be also very psychosomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no clinical reasons why this
subject should have fainted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think about the dosage of just
25 milligrams of THC, it's quite shocking
[SPEAKER_00]: that someone could have this effect from
that dosage considering the doses that are
[SPEAKER_00]: sold and used in dispensaries and other
clinical settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in comparison, this subject,
25 years old, Asian female, with a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: low birth rate and low breasting blood
pressure, had very mild side effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: but had the very highest concentration in
her blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So her tolerance to the 180 nanogram per
ml concentration was quite surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same cohort, same dose, but a very
inter-individual response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So importantly, and as many of you know,
working in cannabis, the start low,
[SPEAKER_00]: go slow really holds true through clinical
setting and through double blind trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we saw that a titration strategy was
necessary to progress to seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven day administration after subject
number three had such a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we introduced a slower titration to
move subjects towards the full dose as
[SPEAKER_00]: they move towards the seven day
administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started with just one inhalation
and moved up to completing the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: pellet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was done to satisfy Health Canada
to progress to the seven day
[SPEAKER_00]: administration and showed a significant
improvement in the adverse event profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, you see here that these are
normalized to the number of dosages that
[SPEAKER_00]: were administered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually when that titration was
administered, the start low, go slow
[SPEAKER_00]: process, we see that that cohort actually
had lower instance of adverse events than
[SPEAKER_00]: the placebo did in the prior cohort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really see a significance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the most common events are
somnolence, dizziness, and headache,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some euphoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, this was a very successful
seven day administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So importantly now for safety,
really this big question is can this drug
[SPEAKER_00]: be moved into phase two and three?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was clear from the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing clinically significant
in cardiovascular, no drug related changes
[SPEAKER_00]: in serum, hematology, or urine,
and everything was primarily mild that was
[SPEAKER_00]: reported, 82 and 94% in the two cohorts,
and we had no serious adverse events at
[SPEAKER_00]: all, nothing life threatening or requiring
hospitalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this product has moved into now a
couple of different trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, a phase three trial,
which is really a compassionate use focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are recruiting for this right now in
Quebec and are looking for other sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: so feel free to reach out to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, this was found to be
generally safe and well tolerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The protocol is to be repeated with a
vaporizer next month to compare the
[SPEAKER_00]: different results and to see the
differences in pharmacodynamics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting as well to look at now
why this concentration may exceed that
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've seen in vaporizer studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we verify that, it will give us a
better idea of in which populations smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis may be preferential over
vaporized, and explain a little bit of why
[SPEAKER_00]: we see the differences in the patient
reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, this maximum time of
very rapid delivery could be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: effective way to treat acute symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, a limitation that is worth a
really heavy investigation in tech is that
[SPEAKER_00]: this variability in inhalation is going to
be a huge challenge and will require some
[SPEAKER_00]: very innovative drug delivery systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested to study this drug,
please reach out to our company or to
[SPEAKER_00]: Tetra Biopharma, and it will be available
as well internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for any contacts, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, that was a great presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Caroline McCallum from Vancouver,
BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just wondering if you can elaborate a
little bit more on the neurocognitive
[SPEAKER_01]: impairment, if there was a standardized
questionnaire that was given to patients
[SPEAKER_01]: or if it was a functional examination or
how you guys classified that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a series of tests that were
performed for both short-term memory,
[SPEAKER_00]: for small motor skills, as well as the
kind of standard mini cognitive effects
[SPEAKER_00]: for cognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, we didn't study
functional impairment, which is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'll look at in future studies,
as we would be concerned about certain
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, oncology populations,
geriatric populations, to use this product
[SPEAKER_00]: without that assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. McCallum.
