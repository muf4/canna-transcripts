[SPEAKER_01]: Can you describe how fusarium affects hemp
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it infect and, you know,
what is sort of the progression?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, let's start with a fusarium is
a genus and it's a very large genus with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of species within a fusarium
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people, when they hear fusarium,
they think of fusarium wilt and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fusarium oxysperum, different special
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fusarium oxysperum or fusarium wilt is
a vascular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all born.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves its way up the vascular system
and it causes wilt because of just
[SPEAKER_00]: blocking water and nutrient uptake to the
top of the plant and necrosis of the
[SPEAKER_00]: xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium head blight is a fusarium
gruminiorum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is infecting flowers and grain
from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very different pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember earlier, I talked about
fusarium salani, a root and crown rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are three main major fusarium
species that affect hemp or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back to fusarium head blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fusarium head blight pathogens,
we have identified five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium gruminiorum is the common one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that you read so much that
affects wheat and cereal crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fusarium gruminiorum will infect
flowers and grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have found it to infect growing tips
and leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But primarily it's gonna be a flower and
grain disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different species of fusarium will kind
of attack the plant from different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to not just say fusarium, because when
we started working on fusarium head
[SPEAKER_00]: blight, the assumption was that it was the
fusarium oxysperum, the fusarium wilt
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very, very different,
even though that first name, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: that genus is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the economic impacts
of fusarium on hemp cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So fusarium head blight, as we call it,
will blight out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blight is kind of a rapid necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that kind of term means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium head blight will blight out a
flower head or a seed head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early shattering, more brittle flower
heads or flowers or grain heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can have it at very low levels as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, remember I mentioned mycotoxins
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fusarium gruminiorum produces two
different mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a mycotoxin is a toxin produced by a
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mycotoxins, there's a history of
mycotoxins in fusarium species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichothecines, for example,
that can cause vomiting, digestion issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in humans and in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in hemp, I'm sorry, in any feed,
it's highly regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even low levels of disease can cause
high levels of toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we're not
regulating here in the US, not in hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: not in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone is really interested in
looking at aflatoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some of those other toxins,
which we're not finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are finding those fusarium
mycotoxins from the head blight pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, all the fusarium out there,
but that's our focus because that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeing the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we feel is the most
important, especially as hemp as an animal
[SPEAKER_00]: feed is coming onto market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned that fusarium could be
there in low levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So might it sort of escape some visual
detection and have some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: mycotoxins present?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to spill the beans a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My graduate student just came in with some
year one data from two different fields
[SPEAKER_00]: here in central Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had fusarium head blight at about
five percent severity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that whole seed head and
about visually five percent of that head
[SPEAKER_00]: had symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very low, something that a grower would
probably overlook, something that I might
[SPEAKER_00]: have said, oh, well, and he ended up
detecting DAWN, deoxynovalinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ended up detecting DAWN at levels that
are above the threshold for human
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption in other grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, we don't have that
threshold for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that threshold, I mean, that would
have failed QC in a cereal grain market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're finding those high levels of
toxins in a year of drought and extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we had low levels of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
Thank you very much.
