[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for inviting me to this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my first conference, so thanks to the
organizers for letting me present our
[SPEAKER_00]: research at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only been in the cannabis space for
maybe six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This conference has been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday I learned a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the biotech space for all my
career, so about 35 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that in private industry for 30
years, and then I kind of came back to
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Wisconsin where I graduated
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And directed a facility that I'll show in
a few slides that does plant engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: and editing of lots of different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I'm going to talk about the work
we're doing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Texas, I'm from Wisconsin,
so we're dealing with a Type 3 version,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'll be interchangeably using hemp and
cannabis during the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so a little bit about our team at
the Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're located off campus and we're a
facility that has about 50 people working
[SPEAKER_00]: at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of almost like a small
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own production, discovery,
plant analysis teams, administration
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, so it's almost a unit outside
campus that does this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The core hemp team, myself, Sean Kepler is
the faculty director of the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shelby Ellison is an assistant professor
working on campus and she does a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis breeding and feral hemp work
on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my team, Cindy, Lucas,
and Jane, they're all working in the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the transformation and gene editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bird's eye view of the center
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be an old Monsanto facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Monsanto donated this facility about
seven years ago to the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: I directed the facility for about five
years and then I stepped back and came
[SPEAKER_00]: back to work on hemp two days a week just
because we had a grant for hemp and I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it was just a fascinating plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really the first time I was
introduced to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility does transformation of many
different species, corn, soybean,
[SPEAKER_00]: different species for both public and
private industries so they can pay a fee
[SPEAKER_00]: for service.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put your favorite gene or knock out
your favorite gene in any of these species
[SPEAKER_00]: and hand you back T1 seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's no strings attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yours to do whatever you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also do collaborations on research
agreements as well if they're longer term.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the first, I think, in the world
to stably engineer heritable cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: that was in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: We filed a patent for our procedure and it
was granted already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we have a dedicated team
of those folks working on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably seen this slide a million
times but some people call this a trillion
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar plant but not only for medical uses
but industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of uses for industrial
hemp as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm bill legalized hemp in 18 so that
gave us freedom to really take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: it because there's really very little
research done in the last 80 years on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, you know, the rec use
and the medicinal use has even increased
[SPEAKER_00]: the value of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think really this is a disruptive
time for cannabis, the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put this slide up just to show that kind
of the history of putting genes into
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, first functional genes in plants
was back in 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working with a group on this as well
as some Monsanto employees and others in
[SPEAKER_00]: universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just an old southern blot showing
T1 inheritance of a gene in a plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in 96, it was kind of a pivotal year
as well where Roundup Ready was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the first, I'll call it GMO plant that was
widely commercialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was of course the flavor saver
tomato before that but it was kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Roundup Ready ushered in this
commercialization of GMO crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: brought in lots of no-till farming,
glyphosate resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our group back in before 96 worked on what
you see up there is the gene gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we invented that at a private company
that I worked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an electronic device that was used
actually to make that Roundup Ready event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before Monsanto purchased that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2018, this is just a picture
of our first transgenic event.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a T1 picture showing a red
fluorescent protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just a proof of concept to show
that we could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progeny and the red plants in that picture
are expressing a red fluorescent protein
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas the green ones don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about genetic
transformation in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of labs have published and can do
transformation in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get actual transformation to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key thing is most of them aren't
able to make it heritable or stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get it in callus formation,
in roots, different parts of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not able to get a stable
transformed event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very recalcitrant to tissue culture
and when I say tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a callus form of the hemp
plant, very hard to actually get a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow out of that callus to
differentiate into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things we've done since the
80s at this facility is we focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: Maristem X plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't deal with callus or
organogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a mature seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We imbibe that seed overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we isolate the Maristem stems
with the primary leaves on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture of what our starting
material is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's your root radical, your primary
leaves there and then there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: Maristematic region there that we're
targeting for transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been able to use both agrobacterium
transformation and the gun transformation
[SPEAKER_00]: for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We choose agrobacterium just because it's
much more efficient and straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know anything about
agrobacterium transformation, if you go
[SPEAKER_00]: for a walk in the woods or in the town,
you see plants with crown galls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's these massive formations on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically a soil bacteria that's
infecting these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally, it infects these plants and it
has some oncogenic genes that form this
[SPEAKER_00]: crown gall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost a cancerous growth on these
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And scientists over the years have
hijacked this bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take out the genes that form that
crown gall, the cancerous genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can put in whatever gene you
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's a yield gene, an
insect-resistant gene, hop-latent mRNA
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that plant will infect the cannabis
plant and deliver its genes to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll express that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start out, this is an agrobacterium
plasmid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start out with a plasmid that's located
inside the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the bacteria is going to
deliver to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where you put your whatever
gene you want the plants to express.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just showing you the proof of
concept vector that we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proof of concept vector we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned it had a red fluorescent
protein in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be this TD tomato gene,
it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has a gus gene in it, which is a
gene that if you give it a substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll show a color of blue if the gene is
present in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just visual markers that
allow us to track, you know, did the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: get transformed or edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those embryos I showed before,
those go through an antibiotic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use spectinomycin as the antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get put on media plates for about
three or four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some bleaching here occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the plant is done and doesn't have
the spectinomycin gene, that spectinomycin
[SPEAKER_00]: will start to bleach the plant and
eventually kill the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's greening shows that that
plant may have the spec gene in it and has
[SPEAKER_00]: probably transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with the spec gene comes your gene
of interest, TD tomato, gus, a yield gene
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually this process takes about six to
eight months going from transformation or
[SPEAKER_00]: co-culture of the agrobacterium to getting
T1 seeds out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our first T0 transgenic event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned it had the blue, this blue gus
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did some staining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this expression of blue
within the germline tissue of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this as a pre-test to see if it
was transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed it had blue in the germline
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were pretty positive that it was a
germline transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few statistics on our transformation
procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our frequencies are in the single digits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if you take 100 of those embryo X
plants, we may see one to five plants come
[SPEAKER_00]: out that are transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally for soybean or corn, we see that
in the 20 to 30% range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got work to do to increase that
frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had success with multiple cannabis
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again we're from Wisconsin so I'm
using CBD varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this particular procedure is
going to be genotype dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can do marijuana, fiber,
hemp, whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made over 200 independent events for
private companies and internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's again very repeatable with
whatever we're trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also done gene edits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm going to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next few slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then since we're starting out with an
embryo X plant, we're not starting out
[SPEAKER_00]: with a single cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do get chimeric events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere between 10 and 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a chimeric event is just an event
that's not fully transformed in every
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a germline transformation
normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take that plant out to T1
status, it may not segregate three to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll be able to find your true
germline transformation and then take it
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and it won't be chimeric.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's again a picture of our T1 progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other examples of our T1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the TD tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a gene called Ruby in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruby is a set of three genes that make
beets red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you eat beets, that's the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put that into hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get a plant that's totally red
compared to the null.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an overexpression of that
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've made knockouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made overexpressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've made some other plants for
private companies where they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved CBD synthase or THC synthases to
see if they can change ratios in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably didn't need this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But normally we're dealing with a variety
we call badger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some cherry wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some chardonnay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some elector in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are dioecious plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to feminize them or masculinize
them to make feminized seed in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the gene to be homozygous in the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned our frequencies are in the
low signal digits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing a lot to try to increase
our transformation frequencies at the
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying different selection ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we use spectenomycin right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using different agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using different agrobacterium
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying liquid culture rather than a
solid media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the biggest thing to try for us
right now, as well as a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: species that people are trying,
are these morphogenic genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these genes elicit embryogenic
responses in plants that are recalcitrant
[SPEAKER_00]: to transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like baby boom, wishel,
lectin, these are all genes that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the big ag companies have looked at and
are getting really good results especially
[SPEAKER_00]: with monocots and now recently with dicots
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be looking at this as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday they talked a lot about LED
lights in culture, I mean in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at LED lights also tissue
culture, so pre-cultivation, and whether
[SPEAKER_00]: we can elicit better growth or different
responses directly in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Media and hormone components are always
played with for probably the last 40
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always look at those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other target tissues other than
the immature embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So targeting, so after our proof of
concept was done, we thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting different enzymes or genes in
the cannabis plant and some of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the obvious ones were the
cannabinoid pathway genes, the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway genes to look and see if we could
actually go and knock some of these out to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if we knock these out in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got similar results that they have done
in yeast or bacteria where they've knocked
[SPEAKER_00]: these genes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the questions, and it was a
controversial question for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: but why do CBDA type 3 plants make THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: And medicinal genomics did a lot of work
on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hemp plants that we use,
the type 3, they don't have an active THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CBD synthase makes actually a
little bit of the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get your .3 or .4 or whatever
percent THC you're getting, it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: active CBD synthase that's actually making
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a promiscuous enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very homologous to THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we targeted in order to try
to knock out CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we went after this was back
in 18 or 17 when the farmers were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: their first fields of hemp in Wisconsin,
about 25% of the fields went hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to destroy their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were saying, we need a THC-free line
in the states that get hit for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some CBGA lines, which is the
grandmother cannabinoid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few lines out there in 18,
but not too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics of those lines are a little
bit questionable based on some data that
[SPEAKER_00]: was done at the University of Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also, not in 18, but recently
GTR made a low THC line that was high in
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went after that CBDA synthase to
knock out, and we used this CRISPR-Cas
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which they use routinely in other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what you end up doing is you
design a guide RNA that targets whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence you want to knock out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guide RNA sits down on the sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cas9 comes in and makes a cut at that
guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plant itself, once it's cut,
it re-ligates itself, just a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-homologous end-joining re-ligation
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully when that re-ligation
happens, you've either dropped out a base
[SPEAKER_00]: or added a base, somehow you've disrupted
that gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how gene editing works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we targeted the CBDA synthase in our
Badger line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just showing a couple examples of what
we got out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first plant we sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had actually two guide RNAs that we sat
down to try to increase our chances of it
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first guide RNA did cut, and we added
a single nucleotide to this sequence,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would knock it out and make it
non-functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also had an insertion, also,
at the other guide site of about 177
[SPEAKER_00]: bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this came from the plasma that was
introduced into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the first event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second event, the two guide RNAs cut
perfectly where they were supposed to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in between those two guide RNAs,
the whole sequence just dropped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we lost the whole sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sequence came back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we have a non-functional CBDA
synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're successful with this,
we shouldn't make any CBDA in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since the CBDA is responsible for the
THCA, we should not have any THC in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we looked at HPLC results.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done on, I think, a 5.5,
five and a half week flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild type plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the CBDA is high in these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a little bit of THC as
well, which, you know, that's what this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant would normally make.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heterozygous edit, and I failed to
mention, but when you make an edit,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you'll only edit one allele in
the plant, not both alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to edit both alleles in order
for that gene to be knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went through a round of selfing of
that plant in order to get a homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: lines for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had heterozygous lines, which just
had one allele knocked out, homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, which had both alleles knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the heterozygous look very
similar to wild type results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the homozygous edit completely drops
out the CBD and the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the precursor, which is CBG,
elevates levels because there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling at it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a high CBG line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these were only a five point five
weeks taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally this badger line is somewhere in
the teens for, for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we expect when we test this,
you know, at later stages, we should be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the teens for, for CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: This line also we, we applied to USDA for
non-regulated status and got that approved
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can freely, this is an edited
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can freely plant it out in the fields
without regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we call it badger G, just for,
we're the badger state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next step for this badger G line,
we want to fully genome sequence it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bulking up feminized seed right now
so that we can get larger quantities for
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are, that may be interested in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is just a high CBG line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are other CBG lines out there we
realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in 18, this is, this is what we
were after.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's companies, Hypercan is a company
that's interested in this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to have a blank slate to start
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a high CBG line would be optimal for
them to put in their engineered CBDA
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase genes so they can play around
with ratios of THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Penn State's interested in this for animal
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since it doesn't have any THC
whatsoever, this, it gets past some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation that some states have for
animal feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're crossing this line since,
since our line is kind of an unknown,
[SPEAKER_00]: this badger line, this line's unknown,
it's a cherry wine based background.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're crossing this line with better known
CBD varieties like ACDC and some others to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into a, hopefully a more well-known
cultivar to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing we're going to do
with this line is take a look since we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of CBG available.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBC is another minor cannabinoid that
we've heard a lot of people are interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in having a very high CBC line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think by using this line and
introducing either mutations to the CBC or
[SPEAKER_00]: over expressing the CBC synthase in this,
in this line, we should be able to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% plus CBC line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other ongoing research is that we're
doing besides cannabinoids, increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: flour and trichrome production to try to
just increase overall cannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomass and yield, which is, is with any
crop valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavonoids, we're looking at the flavonoid
pathway to see if we can increase maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: Canflavin A, Canflavin B that can be used
in medicinal studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiber properties, so industrial hemp is up
and coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are asking,
you know, what can we do for, for fiber in
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we make more uniform fibers,
longer fibers, reduce certain lignans in
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll look at fibers and then seed and
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we do anything with seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you know, I, I, I find this very
similar to what they were looking at in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 80s back for row crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, think about any trait you want
to put into hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's, if you don't think you can do it
by breeding or molecular breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's going to take too long,
this is a, has potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got sandwiched in between two
hoplatin talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, that's all I hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a lot at this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hoplatin is another target that we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been shown to, you know, the RNAi
technology has been shown in other species
[SPEAKER_00]: to work for other viruses and virides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to try to attack that as
well as powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are, again, other species like
wheat and others that people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: successful at getting powdery mildew
resistance in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to try to do that in hemp
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpene profiles are another area that
people are interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increasing levels of various terpenes
that are desirable, increasing trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: density, and maybe knocking out certain
terpenes that people don't want to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can customize your smells or
flavors or whatnot with different
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbicide resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have larger companies asking,
that are looking at hemp for paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They claim wheat is a problem in their
large fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they ask about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just a few slides on
collaborations that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were just press releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I put them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zcal was a customer that came out and put
their photo seed trait in hemp and they
[SPEAKER_00]: got an increase in biomass oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Hypercan, and this should say
actually 2023, but Hypercan put their
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolve CBD synthases, which are supposedly
very active and produce more CBD in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant into hemp as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they saw an increase in cannabinoid
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Hypercan uses a lot of x-ray
crystallography.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know this enzyme inside and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what mutations can change the
CBD synthase to make different ratios of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD to THC so they can customize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the last one on Hypercanons,
this was just their data from their press
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So showing an increase in leaves and
immature flowers in different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, mainly the CBD and the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going through these pretty fast
because I'm running out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also looking again at the
CBC because there seems to be a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we make a CBC line that is 10%
plus, 15% plus for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was kind of hot off the press as
I thought I'd throw in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this result last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just on young leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we targeted also on the OAC enzyme,
which is olivatolic acid cyclase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's olivatolic acid and GPP are the two
precursors to CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you knock out one of them,
the plant ideally shouldn't make any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're seeing in this early
data for leaf data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our control line makes some CBG,
CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our OAC knockout basically doesn't
make, we're still looking at these bars
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of right at the limit of
detection for HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know if they're real or not,
but it's basically dropped out the CBG out
[SPEAKER_00]: of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came to this conference looking,
trying to open minds and trying to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about what traits are out there that
people are very interested in,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for collaborations, partners,
anybody interested in putting their
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite trait or knocking out their trait
in hemp can come talk to me after the
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you happen to have any pictures with
you of the early transfer and early
[SPEAKER_01]: regeneration process once you transform
these meristems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than the ones I've shown?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just how it looks like when they come back
from, regenerate from that little
[SPEAKER_01]: meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure I could dig up some for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there's a couple different
answers, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to knock out multiple genes,
just design your guide RNAs to knock out
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever gene you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally binary plasmids in agro,
normally you can make probably up to a 30
[SPEAKER_00]: kb vector and have it stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been playing around and have had
success with a new, I showed it up there
[SPEAKER_00]: on one of the slides, it's a vector called
gantry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't use a binary vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put the genes right in the backbone of
the agro and deliver it through the
[SPEAKER_00]: backbone of the agro and we're able to
make easily over 40 kb size plasmids to
[SPEAKER_00]: put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to do overexpressed,
say a multisostronic pathway or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could do it using that gantry vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, efficiently normally I would say
goes down just in general in all species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you hit say 15 or 20 kb, delivering
that tdna size, that's where it just
[SPEAKER_00]: starts dropping off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still deliver over a 30 kb thing,
but your efficiency of delivering that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing is going to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice part of the system is,
you know, you put your selectable marker
[SPEAKER_00]: on the left border, right, so you're sure
that the whole thing is going to go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: read through the whole thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned that you're working with
different oxytrophic strains of
[SPEAKER_02]: agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen any significant differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's kind of early work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some LBA 4404 thymidine minus
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason we're doing that is just
agro overgrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're trying to control the
overgrowth in the agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use timetan, we use carb, we use cep,
but every once in a while we'll get this
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping of agro overgrowth that tends to
lower efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thymidine minus, I think it's still
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they're as efficient as other
vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen certain cases where certain
oxytrophic vectors don't perform as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as in delivering tdnas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're working with LBA as opposed to
like GV3101 or?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work we're doing here, and I
mentioned LBA because that's kind of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the oxytroph we have right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work we're doing in cannabis right
now, we've done GV3101 is the one vector
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done, but we mainly use a strain
called 18R12V.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a K599 based ORI type vector that
was disarmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use that mainly because it gives us
a little bit better quality of an insert,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we get potentially fewer copies going
in with that particular thing because it
[SPEAKER_00]: uses an ORI origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
