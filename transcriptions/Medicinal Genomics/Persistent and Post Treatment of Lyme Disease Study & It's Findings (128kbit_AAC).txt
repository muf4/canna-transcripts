[SPEAKER_00]: So your study looked particularly at
persistent and post treatment Lyme
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call it that because in the from our
so a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is I didn't want to allude to the fact
that one should treat acute acute case
[SPEAKER_01]: with just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also in the data set, these are people
that are are, you know, filling out forms
[SPEAKER_01]: saying I have Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what stage they're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so it's that seem like a large enough
grouping is kind of safe to assume that
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're either treating persistent
cases or post treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no reason that some of them
couldn't have been acute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just unlikely if they're just in
that short treatment window of two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: on doxycycline that they would enter this
world of treating it with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The symptoms that we're tracking like
anxiety, inflammatory pain, sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: those kinds of things are common in the
later stages of Lyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, if you're treating it with
cannabis, you've probably already been
[SPEAKER_01]: through this standard route.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are those are assumptions,
but we can't interview these these
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really just looking at they say
they have Lyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're treating X symptom and and the
tool helps them rate it on different
[SPEAKER_01]: scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's interesting, though,
is as ubiquitous as Lyme is, as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is being looked at, nobody had
ever looked at these two together before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you which is really surprising,
because if you do just a simple Google
[SPEAKER_01]: search, there's a lot where every
dispensary is telling you should treat
[SPEAKER_01]: your Lyme disease with cannabis and lots
of lots of doctors websites have blog
[SPEAKER_01]: posts about using cannabis to help with
Lyme disease and lots of Lyme blogs and
[SPEAKER_01]: Lyme information websites tell you CBD and
cannabis are good symptomatic treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But absolutely nobody has done any
academic or formal look at it until now,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're doing a retrospective
sort of naturalistic study and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: continuing to examine more symptoms and
kind of parse out the data because it
[SPEAKER_01]: really is effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting that it affects
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the things that Lyme people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Lyme disease is often a root cause of
things like rheumatoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ALS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be mistaken for Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: If for lupus fibromyalgia, these are all
things people commonly use cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very so and they're not always caused
by Lyme, but Lyme is one of the potential
[SPEAKER_01]: causes of these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was very interesting to me,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we found, though, is that
people who use it for arthritic,
[SPEAKER_01]: for inflammatory pain, if they have Lyme
respond differently than people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: using it for inflammatory pain who don't
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: How so?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like higher THC formulations were found
more relieving for anxiety than mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: In people with Lyme, whereas when we look
at overall on the other end, it's usually
[SPEAKER_01]: the other way around, like a one to one or
a higher CBD ratio formula will be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better for Lyme?
[SPEAKER_01]: For anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the THC is more helpful for Lyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's better relieving
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when we talk about the data,
there's a lot I can say about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, first of all, where are you
getting this data?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's it coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great app and website called
StrainPrint.ca.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Canadian company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also track a fair amount of
American products as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really great use tracking tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I suggest to people, regardless,
because it's helpful because you might say
[SPEAKER_01]: you use and you find, oh, my pain's
really, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also then will ask you,
are you feeling tired?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you feeling a little irritable or
upset stomach?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it helps you note side effects as well
and help dial in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of help dial in your dosing
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it asks people to identify their
disease or diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it will give a list of symptoms
commonly associated with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you can also choose your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tracks up to like 70 different
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you rate it, how you're feeling
on a scale one to 10 before you put in
[SPEAKER_01]: what you took and then rate after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's got for if you're in Canada,
for example, all the products and
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries are loaded into that app.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tracks all the testing data and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also useful for producers and
looking and studies to say, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of a ratio might be good for
this and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it's interesting that we were
able to track a lot of different ratios of
[SPEAKER_01]: products that people used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this one, we know is that down to
like the batch level, too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a company that's regularly
submitting their stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's useful in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the we looked at a combined of inhaled
and edible products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of put it all in one,
but it would be interesting to parse that
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at a range of cannabinoid
ratios, including THC only, CBD only,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then naturalistic ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might in the data, you might see
like a 25 to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's a very high THC cannabis,
but it's still a naturalistic ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got some measurable amount of THC
or CBD and other cannabinoids in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're really just looking at THC and
CBD as well, which is something I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: often not enough, but it's more often than
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the one to one and on the other
end of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found in this data set was
there was an overwhelming preference for
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, very, very strong preference and very
high in the THC only.
[SPEAKER_01]: I note that to a product availability,
what's what's pushed in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a higher margin in distillate and
in some ways sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the convenience factor there as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's also primarily what's in
edibles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They use distillate in edibles as well,
because then they can have an even measure
[SPEAKER_01]: of dosage, even though it may not be the
best delivery method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while that was used the most often,
not in every case was it the most
[SPEAKER_01]: preferred, but it always scored very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at other ones,
what often scored equally high and or
[SPEAKER_01]: better with less dosages was naturalistic
ratios or a one to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD only often also didn't perform very
well in general.
I think that's part of it.
