[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing, who will be part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the CanMed 2020 conference in Pasadena,
California, this September 20th through
[SPEAKER_00]: 22nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we get the chance to talk
with our first representative from the
[SPEAKER_00]: safety focus area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iniya Fia is the scientific director at
Canisaf Labs, one of the largest cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: testing labs in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you aren't familiar with what exactly
goes on at a cannabis testing lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're likely in the majority.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned in my conversation with
Iniya, the cannabis testing labs are sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of like the unsung heroes of the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They serve a very important role in
ensuring consumer and patient safety,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they rarely get recognized for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, Iniya and I
discussed the types of tests labs perform
[SPEAKER_00]: in California, what challenges they face
being in a regulated market, and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: balance keeping customers happy with also
keeping consumers safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the end of this episode,
you will hopefully have a much better
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciation for cannabis testing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also get into the testing Iniya has
performed on the ingredients in vaporizer
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridges in the wake of last year's
vaping crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited to have Iniya as a CanMed
presenter this year, and we are also
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunate to have him as a member of our
advisory board.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, along with the other advisors,
review all the abstracts that were
[SPEAKER_00]: submitted and select the very best to be
oral and poster presentations at the
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first round of abstract presenters,
along with the preliminary schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: will be announced June 3rd, which is just
one week from when this podcast goes live.

[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with any,
I want to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: CannaSafe Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: CannaSafe is proud to be the first fully
ISO 17025 accredited cannabis testing lab
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a full-service testing lab dedicated
to relentlessly championing the safe
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hemp movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more about CannaSafe at csalabs.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Iney
[SPEAKER_00]: Afiyah of CannaSafe Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Iney, thanks for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to have a conversation
with you today because you come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing side of the cannabis industry and
we deal a lot with the testing labs here
[SPEAKER_00]: on the medicinal genomic side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you don't mind me saying,
but I really feel like the testing labs
[SPEAKER_00]: are sort of the unsung heroes of the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just telling a colleague earlier
that to use a football analogy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you guys are like the
offensive line of the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: which unfortunately means that if you're
doing everything right, we don't hear
[SPEAKER_00]: about you guys a lot, but fortunately when
things go wrong, that's when we hear about
[SPEAKER_00]: the testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which I think is really unfortunate
because you guys do a lot of great work
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a lot of great contributions to
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you feel like my analogy is apt?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's easy to pick at the
negatives when things do go wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: but forget all the positive and year long
hard work that we put in to ensure
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some context, Eni is of course the
scientific director at CannaSafe Labs out
[SPEAKER_00]: there in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of cannabis labs out
there in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was reading an article that said
there's about 33 licensed labs in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like a pretty competitive
market out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you guys navigate that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a lot more now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, CannaSafe isn't a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just began yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been the business for quite some
time now, although it was a smaller lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being the first lab to be ISO 17-025
accredited in cannabis sort of set us
[SPEAKER_01]: apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we simply took off from there and
continued down that path of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: being the go-to lab in the space or being
the industry pioneers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the name, the branding itself is sort
of, I guess you could say set us apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you think of going to the
store, you can think of Target,
[SPEAKER_01]: Walgreens, although there are many other
drug stores you could go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But apart from that, we've upheld the
scientific excellence in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been on the forefront of every
breaking news and whatnot and new method
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's allowed us to essentially
be able to keep the market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned you were the first ISO
certified lab in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, back in about 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we were the ISO 17-025, first ISO
17-025 accredited lab in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, calling up the accrediting body
and saying, hey, we want to get accredited
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis wasn't an easy feat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they just kind of laughed like,
really?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this illegal stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, given that I wasn't with CannaSafe
at the time, but just being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually get that accreditation kind of
paved the way for even that industry to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize, hey, there's another sort of
niche here that we could tackle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of it helped legitimize the whole
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask what that conversation
was like being the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, from what I've heard,
they pretty much laughed at the call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wait, you want us to accredite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Accredited cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at that point it was mostly
potency and a couple of contaminant
[SPEAKER_01]: assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CannaSafe in Marietta, California was
owned by, you know, well-respected
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wanted to help legitimize the
business industry from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually the accrediting body called us
back and decided to give it a shot after
[SPEAKER_01]: some convincing that the lab is a
legitimate lab and not just you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: another cannabis storefront or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a typical day like at CannaSafe
labs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, you know, you come in and hit
the ground running.
[SPEAKER_01]: CannaSafe lab being, you know,
the number one market shareholder in the
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a variety of staff groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, from our marketing to account
executives to the samplers.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a fleet of cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, the lab staff,
there's the admin staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We employ over 150 people in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're constantly going around making
sure that this machine, this well-oiled
[SPEAKER_01]: machine is running smoothly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that's not always the case with
any business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've put people in strategic position
to make sure that everything's being
[SPEAKER_01]: communicated effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, our customers come first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a huge customer service team
that we are constantly in contact with to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure they are getting their needs
met.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sort of, you know, bounce in between
all those areas to make sure that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, wherever I'm needed,
I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many samples do you guys manage to
process with 150 people working?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I imagine is probably around the
clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're pretty much working around the
clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, of all of those 150 people,
probably about half of them are actual
[SPEAKER_01]: analytical lab staff and the rest are
sales and other antilayer positions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, without giving up the exact
number, it's quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anywhere from 100 to 200 samples a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you mentioned when you guys first
started that it was mostly potency in a
[SPEAKER_00]: few contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that the regulations in
California have gotten quite more
[SPEAKER_00]: stringent since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is sort of the battery of tests
that an average sample needs to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, back in early 2000s,
yeah, it was really no regulations up
[SPEAKER_01]: until about two or three years ago when
the real regs hit with the creation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: DCC and MacRESA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking about potency,
pesticides, terpenes, if appropriate,
[SPEAKER_01]: the contaminant assays such as heavy
metals, microbial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we're talking about microbial,
we're talking about the aspergillus
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shiga toxin producing E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and pathogenic salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's water activity tests and also
moisture on flower residual solvents as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a typical flower would have to go
through essentially those complete battery
[SPEAKER_01]: of tests and have to pass the stringent
limit to be able to be put on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what percentage, give or take,
do you think actually gets through?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it gets to the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many samples are you are failing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's funny because we've
been doing some trending data,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we'll be putting out shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already put some out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're looking back at the can of sale
as it exists today in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: when it was opened back in the beginning
of January of 2018 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, about a quarter of the
product that we're coming through or more
[SPEAKER_01]: were failing for pesticides and and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a learning period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a learning period for people who
had to now come into the light and learn
[SPEAKER_01]: to deal with this regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to learn which pesticides not to
use and how to grow without them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So products were failing about a quarter
to a third.
[SPEAKER_01]: But recently, you know, not an exact
figure, but there's about 10 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: failure rate for the various assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the manufacturers have really learned
and up their game to be able to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: cleanly without pesticides or pathogenic
organisms and also without introducing
[SPEAKER_01]: things like heavy metals, which generally
vape carts would fail for mostly because
[SPEAKER_01]: of hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are trending in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manufacturers are getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the manufacturers are definitely
getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've been leading that effort
in education, making sure that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, instead of just failing
somebody, we're helping educate the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: community, we're educating our clients how
to better produce clean products and avoid
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the pitfalls we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned education,
because if anyone follows CannaSafe on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media, you'll see that you guys are
very dedicated to educating the market on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whether it be testing or just
the science behind cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really a great follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not following CannaSafe,
definitely, definitely do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you guys are putting out some
great content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've been making sure that our
community, we have a very big social media
[SPEAKER_01]: presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're making sure that community is
well informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: After all, the regulations do not work if
people are not following them or people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what to look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making sure you're educated about,
you know, asking about certificate of
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis and what sort of contaminants
should you be looking for in your cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: product, you know, especially for people
with certain conditions who should not be
[SPEAKER_01]: ingesting certain contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just making sure that you're a
well-informed consumer, not just a
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer, but the manufacturers like I
spoke on before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a very important aspect of
this community in that in order to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in order for all boats to rise
in the tide and come into the light,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to be well informed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's so right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as educating the consumer,
I mean, we have to remember that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these consumers aren't just consumers,
they're patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you alluded to, there's certain
considerations they need to take,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they're immunocompromised or have
some other vulnerabilities that they need
[SPEAKER_00]: to really be aware of what's in their
product and make sure that it's tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't performing in the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is something I
strongly believe in, in that all labs in
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry, all cannabis labs should be
joining efforts to make sure the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: is protected, to make sure that we are all
on the up and up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important, like you mentioned,
for immunocompromised individuals who are
[SPEAKER_01]: using this for cancer therapy or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you ingest cannabis,
there's different routes of
[SPEAKER_01]: administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while some of these contaminants may be
higher level in other food products,
[SPEAKER_01]: chances are you're inhaling certain
chemicals and, you know, not enough has
[SPEAKER_01]: been studied about it to be able to speak
on whether that route of administration is
[SPEAKER_01]: more detrimental or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing we know for a fact is if
it's not going through the digestive
[SPEAKER_01]: system, chances are it is more detrimental
than not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important that people are aware of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, especially when so much of the
narrative that's out there about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is how safe it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you're really looking at,
you know, THC or CBD and how there's never
[SPEAKER_00]: really been an overdose of these
compounds, you assume that, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, there are these
additional contaminants that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: present that you really need to be aware
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why labs like yours are so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that was recently in
the news was the whole issue with the vape
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis or the vape situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you and the folks at
Cannasafe were doing some research into
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping that you could share what you
found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, when the vape crisis
broke, we jumped on it because it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: big consumer concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were coming to us, hey,
what do you suggest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can we go?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we jumped right on it to continue to
instill that consumer confidence in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and make sure that the whole
industry is not taken down by a few bad
[SPEAKER_01]: actors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we went into the quote
unquote black market and purchased
[SPEAKER_01]: products and started doing the testing
ourselves before the CDC was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: verify that it was vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I quickly jumped on instruments
and developed the assay to look for
[SPEAKER_01]: vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite surprising, quickly finding out in
our first set of assays, our first set of
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, that there were huge levels of
vitamin E acetate in this product,
[SPEAKER_01]: over 50% in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people were just unscrupulously cutting
the product with this thickening agent or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, but there were high
levels of several pesticides along with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not actually meeting labeled THC
claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these products were labeled 80 to
90% THC, but you only found that they
[SPEAKER_01]: contain about 10 to 20% while the majority
of it was vitamin E acetate and other
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting agents and contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's certainly scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was really unfortunate
after that first set of assays,
[SPEAKER_01]: we really decided to dig a little deeper
and go into what else may we be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: find in these illicit products and
actually compare them to legal product as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at things like some other
cutting agents or, you know, what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of temperatures and flavors and
even other contaminants such as metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Running more of full scan type of study
onto what other, what you would refer to
[SPEAKER_01]: as harmful or potentially harmful
contaminants such as carbonyls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did a lot of work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've seen the paper out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did get a chance to review it
before we, before we jumped on the call
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I guess it's, it shouldn't be
a huge surprise that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market product's not going to be
as safe as things that are going through
[SPEAKER_00]: your lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, especially with the,
with the vape cartridges, it being sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a newer form of a newer delivery system
for the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly introducing a lot more
variables, a lot more dangerous
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean you're completely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be a surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I do not believe that the
characters that were putting this product
[SPEAKER_01]: out there had ill intent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was lack of information,
lack of research, lack of, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific study, because people will be
thinking, oh, it's vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, this is useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a necessary nutrient and people use
it all the time topically ingesting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody thought about the fact that,
hey, what about inhaling this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What could it possibly do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, these people were finding
good ways to cut corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, they were putting humans lives
at risk by using pesticide laden product,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the vitamin E acetate,
I do not believe that that was ill intent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely the pesticides and other
contaminants that were in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be seen as such.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and another thing it did was it
really highlighted what another thing what
[SPEAKER_00]: we probably all know is that the black
market is still out there and still
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what what do we do to
sort of try to reduce that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard because it's more of grayish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is the black black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quote, unquote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is the other market,
which are just, let's say, the non-legal
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are people who've been in the
industry, have been doing things right and
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't acquired a license yet and have to
continue making a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're making great products and
putting it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't have a BCC license or
whatnot that are probably in the process
[SPEAKER_01]: of getting that license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there's those folks that
just want to do whatever they can to make
[SPEAKER_01]: quick buck in their kitchen and cut with
whatever they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, definitely getting
people a license as quickly as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: for those that are trying to get licensed
is key for the state to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's done as efficiently as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then really going after the bad actors
that are, you know, not in the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get a license or not interested
in it, that are just cooking whatever in
[SPEAKER_01]: the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those bad actors have to be
removed from the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tough to tackle that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sort of see who to go after.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe that if the state does their
best to get people who are applying for
[SPEAKER_01]: license as quickly as possible so that
they can come into the light and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're branded well, the products
are tested, accompanied with a COA,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would really help the whole industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's, you know, like I'm
saying, I think it's more than just a
[SPEAKER_01]: simple black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of great areas, different shades
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is getting a license in California
particularly difficult?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe it's difficult,
but I think there may be some lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency in the process in terms of how
quickly people are able to get licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: and even education on what you need to do
to get a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people we found are still not
educated on the licensing process,
[SPEAKER_01]: which steps you need to take, how,
you know, what municipalities are
[SPEAKER_01]: accepting licenses or there is a lot of
lack of education out there for people
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to acquire licenses quickly and
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that has to be tackled first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, while we're kind of on the topic of,
you know, the regulated market,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, your business being a testing lab
is definitely dependent on different
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mentioned before, that California
recently came out with regulations with
[SPEAKER_00]: the BCC a few years ago, where before
there weren't many.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are your feelings on sort of what
you're required to test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's overly scrupulous?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I thoroughly believe that
regulations make the world go around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people may may whine at speed
limits, but you know, speed limits are
[SPEAKER_01]: there for a reason and they make us all
safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, interestingly, I joined cannabis in
directly in a highly regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I joined cannabis back in about 2013,
2014 in Nevada when they just introduced a
[SPEAKER_01]: set of regulations that are pretty much
all states have followed on afterwards,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, set of regulations encompassing
pretty much what California has.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know any worse than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so for me, I thoroughly believe
in the current regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, of course, certain things that
California did a little differently that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't necessarily enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So California says you have to test
product in its final packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's great to keep people in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, what they don't realize is we're
looking at things like vape cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to acquire about 0.35% of a
certain amount of vape card based on
[SPEAKER_01]: batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's just an estimate,
but generally hundreds of cards based on
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever batch the manufacturers produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, if I go to pick up a
sample and the manufacturers produce,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, thousands of vape cards,
I may have to pick up hundreds of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cards and I have to come into the lab and
open all of those, you know, these are
[SPEAKER_01]: fused together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're metal pieces that you have to
crack open.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in their packaging in their
cardboard boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all contain lithium batteries or
nickel batteries or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a whole lot of waste that
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have to worry about recycling
the batteries from the vape cards,
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling the metals, throwing away the
cardboard boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we're caring about the
environment here, this is not really the
[SPEAKER_01]: way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we produce a ton of waste in the lab
just because we're sampling final product
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one piece of legislation I
wish could be redone in a way that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you have the track and trace
system, use it well so that we can sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making vape cards, you have
gallons of oil, the lab can go and sample
[SPEAKER_01]: that finished product at that point and do
the testing and then the manufacturer can
[SPEAKER_01]: fill afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having them fill and then having the
lab spend all this effort and introducing
[SPEAKER_01]: all this waste, you know, it's unlike
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm surprised at that piece of
legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's got to be a huge risk for the
manufacturer as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to basically go through the entire
production process of packaging everything
[SPEAKER_00]: with the reality that it can potentially
fail and you'd have to scrap all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be... Oh, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happened quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they've gone through a testing and
actually failed and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: now they're having to sort of recollect
their product from those packages,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, tear boxes, open up vape cards
and recollect the product and maybe try to
[SPEAKER_01]: remediate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why we try to educate our
clients in R&D testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, get it tested immediately so that you
know what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your hardware tested because what has
happened is you can sample that finished
[SPEAKER_01]: product and it's clean and then you stick
it into some bad hardware and metals are
[SPEAKER_01]: leaching into your final product now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you found out that, hey,
after a package 10,000 vape cards,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're now all failing for lead because
you put it into untested carts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, part of education is working
with our clients on making sure every
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of in-process material is tested so
they can get to a final clean product
[SPEAKER_01]: without any surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suppose that's sort of a vote for
testing that final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said that, you know, once you
introduce it into packaging or you put the
[SPEAKER_00]: oil into the vape cart, you could be
introducing some new contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be important for the manufacturer
to kind of be testing multiple times
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire process so they can
kind of really zero in on where the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential failure point could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most importantly, it is important that,
you know, some manufacturers may say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, why would I spend all this money,
you know, doing all this in-process
[SPEAKER_01]: testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you think about what kind of money
will you be wasting to remediate or the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of losses you'd be taking if you do
fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in everybody's best interest to
make sure that you test in-process
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you mentioned that you got into the
cannabis space in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you doing before cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your pre-cannabis life like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-cannabis life?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working at a few pharmaceutical
companies, including Merck and Abbott Labs
[SPEAKER_01]: and Life Technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right before cannabis, I was actually
in nutraceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a vitamin manufacturing company in
Las Vegas, Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I've always been in this trend of
I don't know what you want to call it,
[SPEAKER_01]: wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the next natural jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I love to take vitamins to stay
healthy, but I also recognize the benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always been in that sort of
industry and the QC testing part of those
[SPEAKER_01]: industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So jumping from nutraceutical testing,
QC testing for consumer safety to QC
[SPEAKER_01]: testing cannabis for consumer safety was
right up my wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the safety testing in QC
differ in a nutraceutical or vitamin
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario as opposed to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do they have third party testing
labs that need to test the product before
[SPEAKER_00]: it hits the shelves in that space as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a nutraceutical or vitamin face
sort of a similar problem that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: some cannabis is now facing in that they
had, or let's just say before there were
[SPEAKER_01]: rules in cannabis, nutraceuticals were
sort of a free for all before they became
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated by FDA and other bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people could, you know, make vitamin C
in their living room, have a label printer
[SPEAKER_01]: and stick it on and sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But luckily the company I was working in
Las Vegas had an in-house testing lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is where I was working at,
but they also send out products for third
[SPEAKER_01]: party testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were doing potency and other
contaminant testing, both in incoming raw
[SPEAKER_01]: material and finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it worked similarly testing for the
efficacy, the potency, microbials and
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals, not necessarily pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, but it's sort of
interesting to see how cannabis has
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved past what, you know, industries
like nutraceuticals, which have been
[SPEAKER_01]: around for quite some time, where they're
at now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference is the FDA does audit
nutraceutical companies, but they do not
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously because cannabis isn't federally
legal yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you see the kind of testing
landscape change changing if and when that
[SPEAKER_00]: finally does happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I believe it will be the same
set of rules, maybe different action
[SPEAKER_01]: limits for different analytes,
but it'll become federally regulated by
[SPEAKER_01]: the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll now have the FDA coming into audit
your processes, not just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're following your own SOPs,
but making sure everything from top to
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom your consumer complaints and
whatnot, that your marketing practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they audit everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see it being a little more stringent
in that sense, but as far as what assays
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually being done, they will most
likely remain the same or similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you feel like there's anything
that labs should be testing for that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just not testing for now,
whether it be because it's not mandated or
[SPEAKER_00]: the customer doesn't want it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it depends which side you're
looking at, because we know that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: contains so many other nutrients,
phytonutrients, vitamins, and
[SPEAKER_01]: antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice to start to quantify
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other end of maybe contaminant
assays, I think it's well covered as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as the contaminant assays, but perhaps
expand the pesticide scope to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: open-ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are hundreds, I think over
800 pesticides out there, and you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: California testing, 60 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, there are no rules for
applications of any pesticides on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, at least in California,
but I would like to see that expanded,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I guess if I were a grower,
you're telling me, hey, there is residue
[SPEAKER_01]: limits for this, 66, well, there's
hundreds more other pesticides with maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: similar functionality out there that I
could use that the labs would not be
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, at the end of the day, in an effort to
ensure consumer safety, it would be better
[SPEAKER_01]: to expand that scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sort of reminds me of that
documentary, what was it, Icarus,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they were testing for
performance-enhancing drugs, that as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as you identify one, you come up with an
assay, and you start testing for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the cheaters are just going to choose
something else to keep the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm sure it's a cat and mouse game,
very similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, and I understand some people
may not agree with that statement,
[SPEAKER_01]: my statement of expanding the scope,
but you have to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're all about wellness and consumer
safety, it should not be a problem to
[SPEAKER_01]: expand that scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only people who would be really
worried about this are maybe people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing some unscrupulous things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also mentioned maybe expanding the
different abinoids or terpenes that the
[SPEAKER_00]: labs are reporting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any in particular that pique
your interest that you think could be the
[SPEAKER_00]: next big compound that these cultivators
or manufacturers are going to try to be
[SPEAKER_00]: developing products around?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know there was a recent
discovery of CHCP or so, but it's such
[SPEAKER_01]: residual levels of it, it's hard to say
because there are a lot more cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: available in the plant, but they're at
such minute levels, it's almost
[SPEAKER_01]: inconsequential testing for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until their efficacy is proven at a
certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see maybe more testing around other
phytonutrients, you know, vitamin K,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, or Cersertin and camphorol,
some of those antioxidants, some
[SPEAKER_01]: anthocyanins, which are definitely
available, especially in some of your more
[SPEAKER_01]: colorful varieties cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those would be useful and finding ways
that we can preserve those or different
[SPEAKER_01]: routes of extracting those, whether it be
fresh flower or whatnot, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a lot of nutrients that are
being missed by just sticking to a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: either extraction or a certain mode of use
as an inhaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely I think that plant has a lot
more benefits to offer as a fresh plant
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, to bring it all back to
CanMed, that's why, you know, that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: we're so happy with the model that we have
here, because we're bringing together
[SPEAKER_00]: people from all different sides of the
industry, where we have sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: research scientists who are trying to
discover these lesser cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds to see what sort of medical
efficacy they could have, bringing that
[SPEAKER_00]: information to the physicians or the
healthcare professionals who are treating
[SPEAKER_00]: the patients, but also bringing it to the
cultivators who may want to try to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: some new novel strains that are going to
be producing these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then folks like yourself who are going
to have to be developing the methods to
[SPEAKER_00]: either test for those, or if you're more
on the extraction manufacturer side,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we extract those compounds out of
the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like to think that we're bringing in
all the people necessary so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get the most out of this plant so we can
benefit the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, last year at CanMed,
I was really impressed with what was
[SPEAKER_01]: happening with, I forget who the main
owner of the company is, but I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: Rafael Machulam is a partner in that with
their new discovery of sort of a
[SPEAKER_01]: methylated cannabinoid that was found to
be highly more efficient or useful or
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailable, I should say, than the
actual cannabinoid by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see things like that happening simply
adding a methyl group, a methyl group to
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabinoid allows it to penetrate the
cell better or have more bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are really exciting works that
make this industry exciting for me and
[SPEAKER_01]: make me glad to be in this every day and
see how people are introducing this novel
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that are only gonna set us further
apart as a legitimate industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly an exciting thing to be a
part of when you realize that we're only
[SPEAKER_00]: really scratching the surface of what this
plant can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even, I mean, to even look beyond
pharmaceutical or ingesting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when you think about hemp and all the
possibilities that has for producing
[SPEAKER_00]: textiles or different things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, it's a really exciting thing
to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're excited to have you,
Iny, be a part of CanMed this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're serving on the advisory
board and we're really excited to have you
[SPEAKER_00]: out there in Pasadena this September.
