[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon and thank you for joining
us here today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to take a moment, though,
to thank CanMed and their entire team for
[SPEAKER_09]: putting this conference on and also the
time for our panelists that they're
[SPEAKER_09]: spending with us today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the moderator today.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Michael Stramaitis.
[SPEAKER_09]: My friends call me Big Mike.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm the CEO and founder of Advanced
Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: We manufacture a complete cannabis growing
system consisting of fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_09]: additives that optimize every stage of the
plant's growth from seed to some essence.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So today's panel is going to be about the
role that nutrients play in yield,
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoid output and plant vigor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, before we get started, I'd like the
panelists to introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm Carlo Rave.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a PhD in plant molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I worked on plant nutrition for more
than 15 years, specifically focusing on
[SPEAKER_03]: iron, metal nutrition, iron and copper
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Iney Afia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the chief science officer at
Canisave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been in the cannabis industry since about
2013 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been instrumental in setting up a
couple of labs across the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently at Canisave, pretty much was a
growth leader in the space in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been able to do that
successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also co-owner of a consulting company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Allison Justice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am a plant scientist.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll probably hear it in my accent,
but I'm from South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_07]: After graduation at Clemson University,
I went out to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_07]: For some, I've been back in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: In SoCal, that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I worked for a vertically integrated
company in San Diego where we grew
[SPEAKER_07]: indoors, outdoors, greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: But currently, and for the last four
years, I am back in South Carolina where I
[SPEAKER_07]: have a hemp company that's vertically
integrated and also a research company
[SPEAKER_07]: that we can get into more later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to talk about the research
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the meantime, Hope Jones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my PhD at the University of Arizona,
plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my minor for my PhD.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my major as an undergraduate.
[SPEAKER_04]: My PhD work was actually in molecular
cellular biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was doing cancer research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also worked at NASA researching how
to grow plants in space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I took a period of time off from
the hard sciences for a while until the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry came calling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now I'm back full circle,
actually, which is very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is where I'm the happiest,
is where I actually get to work with
[SPEAKER_04]: people and work with plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get both of my two favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's really about, to me, I see it as
a playground for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I cannot do it without the knowledge
of the people like you, Big Mike,
[SPEAKER_04]: and other like my partners I work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I did not come from the industry
from the black market days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's so much to understand about
this plant that it's one of the reasons,
[SPEAKER_04]: actually, why I come to conferences all
the time is to help me be better at what I
[SPEAKER_04]: do by learning about these strains and
these genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just been a long road for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Been a long road for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first question I got for the panelists
are, what are some of the commonly held
[SPEAKER_09]: misconceptions that you found out about
cannabis in your research?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a great topic.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what misconceptions about cannabis in
your research that you found?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's a misconception.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's at least a mislabeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about micronutrients,
usually people think they're not essential
[SPEAKER_03]: or not as essential.
[SPEAKER_03]: As nitrate, phosphate, and in fact,
they are as essential as any other
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are characterized as micronutrients
because they accumulate only at a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: level, a few ppm in the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are more than essential.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I can take iron as an example,
because I worked a lot on this nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Iron is utilized in directly or indirectly
any region.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two main reactions involving iron that
are critical are respiration and
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: These two processes are just the energy
plant in a cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And without these, basically, there is no
development.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to capture one molecule of light,
one quantum of light, and to transform it
[SPEAKER_03]: into a molecule that is useful for the
plant, the photosystem, which is a complex
[SPEAKER_03]: that captures this light, and transform it
in chemical energy, require more than 20
[SPEAKER_03]: atoms of iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: And any missing iron atom in this complex
will completely disrupt the light energy
[SPEAKER_03]: capture.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the respiration, the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the plant doesn't have enough iron,
the respiration will be compromised.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plant development will be
dramatically affected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think one of the misconceptions is
that micronutrients are not as important
[SPEAKER_03]: as micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: But micronutrients have a macro function.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, iron is a very example for
that because life could not have evolved
[SPEAKER_03]: without iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Iron is utilized in all the organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nature hasn't found any ways to supplement
iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few tiny examples where copper
or other metals could replace iron in one
[SPEAKER_03]: protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: But life is sustained based on iron
biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's more than a critical nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really here on the analytical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this great wealth of knowledge,
experts that are sitting here more in
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the ones that I've heard is the
correlation between your cultivar or your
[SPEAKER_00]: strain color with the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think this really comes from
the seasoned growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is more of a layman's general
public thinking, perhaps, when you get
[SPEAKER_00]: those vibrant purples, hues, all those
colors, that generally it's higher
[SPEAKER_00]: potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, being in the analytical
lab, I get to usually prove them wrong all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, I've been seeing the
reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of hypotheses about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've sort of been talking to some
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, what's the case around certain
colors when you have your harvested plant
[SPEAKER_00]: having certain colors and having lower
potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, my hypothesis was that it has
to do with sort of the ability to you're
[SPEAKER_00]: driving your potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're driving the plant to produce
more anti-cyan and it's usually
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other things that could be
responsible for that flavonoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But chances are you're pushing the plant
to focus on another part of its energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: something else rather than making high
potency THC or increase in trichome size
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to hear this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, when we get that in the
lab, you see that the lower potency ones
[SPEAKER_00]: are also colorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Alison here will be able to
tell you a little bit more later about why
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just an interesting misconception
that I hear out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would say my biggest surprise being
in the cannabis industry is the
[SPEAKER_07]: application of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so going back to grad school,
reading by the book, yes, phosphorus is
[SPEAKER_07]: needed for flower production.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're thinking of other plants,
[SPEAKER_07]: of course, they need phosphorus as one of
the essential nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: But thinking back in grad school,
we applied 8%, 10% with, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_07]: parts per million, with 20 parts per
million being kind of that top leveled
[SPEAKER_07]: out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the extreme.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when I got to San Diego 2016,
the company I was working with,
[SPEAKER_07]: they already had a cannabis nutrient
company that they were using, not yours.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll change that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the label seemed vague.
[SPEAKER_07]: And me being used to actually taking
individual salts and making my own
[SPEAKER_07]: fertilizers, I said, OK, well,
I have to figure out what's in here,
[SPEAKER_07]: see what's very different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were applying 100, up to 200
parts per million phosphorus in flour,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is just mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you think of field crops,
what's our biggest pollutant?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so even though the mines sit in
cannabis is be efficient, be sustainable,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's actually a lot of pollution
happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: That extra phosphorus that you're applying
is going right down the drain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian Whipker at NC State has done some
great work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And nutrition is for him.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've got to play on both sides.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's got some excellent papers out
there showing, well, if you get over 15
[SPEAKER_07]: parts per million phosphorus, you're not
doing any good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not getting more yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not getting more potency.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just wasting money and polluting
the planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess my takeaway is a lot of the
misconceptions of, well, yes, phosphorus
[SPEAKER_07]: is needed for flowering.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's pump the phosphorus in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of backwards.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as you know, there's lockout.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's all sorts of other problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: You start applying more phosphorus,
well, you're going to block the uptake of
[SPEAKER_07]: certain things, specifically zinc.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is that causing as a problem down
the road?
[SPEAKER_07]: So know your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, as far as misconception,
I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the first presentations I gave
about six years ago, I was talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I showed a picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I walked into it at the grow that
I was running.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was walking down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I'm giving this talk,
the thing that shocked me was nobody
[SPEAKER_04]: believed that cannabis could get virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And still to this day, I might hear that
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it shocked me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was actually even more concerning
was with our own staff.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I found it, walking down the row in
this particular facility, the moms were in
[SPEAKER_04]: the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one large bay in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the moms were in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: The clones were on each side of the mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the veg plants and the teens and
the early veg were over off to the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm walking down the rows.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just was stopped.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said to the guys, I said,
well, what do you think's happening here?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get that answer a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a Cal Mag problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then that's when we engage some of our
troubleshooting mental checklists.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so if it's Cal Mag, the other answer I
got from the other kid that was there,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he was in charge of watering,
he's like, oh, it's a pH issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, it could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: But do you measure your inputs and
outputs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mental troubleshooting checklist question
number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it is a certain nutrient deficiency or
toxicity or cation competition,
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the plants in this row or in this
room are being watered and fed the same,
[SPEAKER_04]: would you expect only to see it randomly
in these three plants in different rows?
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're close together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those kinds of misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody goes right to the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the response is, when it came to
disease, that I think that's one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: reasons, again, this is my two cents in
theory, that the disease status is so bad
[SPEAKER_04]: because we're so good at as an industry at
sharing everything or wanting to have
[SPEAKER_04]: everything that is just killer and killing
it at the cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't quite understand our
nutrients and then the troubleshooting
[SPEAKER_04]: behind that, that things get away from us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now it's a problem that we have
to deal with at a national or
[SPEAKER_04]: international level from a disease status.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was just going to add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real life experience is we had a client
bring his plant to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was sick, and they thought it
was nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, we run HLVD and some other
beet curly top virode on it, sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: having low experience around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, it was HLVD that was
infecting his plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was pretty bad, even on the
dried, cured flower generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you don't test for with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was evident that it was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really wasn't a nutrient situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go right to the newts.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, Hope did a really great paper
for us on HLV.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can find it at advancednutrients
.com forward slash HLV.
[SPEAKER_09]: Carl, I have a follow up question for you
about iron.
[SPEAKER_09]: What forms of iron can translocate and
which forms of iron cannot in the plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Iron exists in two forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ferric iron, which is an oxidized
iron, FA3 plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a reduced form, which is called
ferrous iron two, two plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is basically the source
of its use in biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because once you have a protein that bind
iron, this protein now have the capacity
[SPEAKER_03]: to take an electron from another molecule
and to transfer it to another molecule by
[SPEAKER_03]: changing its balance between iron two and
iron three.
[SPEAKER_03]: So iron lose an electron to give it to a
molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is how all the oxidoreductions
reaction works in living organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's so important, in fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it also exists in the soil in these
two forms, iron two and iron three.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much more as iron three, because iron is
easily oxidized by oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is plenty of iron on the earth
crust.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very abundant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, it's all oxidized
because of oxygen from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like basically rust.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is very unavailable to plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants like cannabis, because there
are different type of strategies depending
[SPEAKER_03]: on the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But plants like cannabis used to take it
up as iron two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it has to be in its reduced form,
which is basically very poorly available
[SPEAKER_03]: in soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a very low amount of ferrous
iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the plant have developed some system in
order to acidify the root area in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: basically transform this iron three into
iron two, making it soluble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a very specific transporter kind
of channel on the root cells can take up
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically this iron two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, cannabis has also a secondary system
that can take up iron three, but iron
[SPEAKER_03]: three needs to be related to different
molecules, organic molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a complex iron three plus organic
molecules, this can be taken up by the
[SPEAKER_03]: roots by a different transporter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once it gets inside the plant,
iron is so reactive by changing electron,
[SPEAKER_03]: taking electron from other molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a very dangerous element to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it has always to be chelated into the
cells in order to be less reactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is basically transforming across the
plant and translocated to the shoot in the
[SPEAKER_03]: form of iron three citrate, iron three
nicosiganamine, which are all organic
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds that allow to transport the iron
three into a soluble form.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the different parts of a plant and to
prevent its reactivity, its uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_03]: reactivity with other molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it gets to the shoot,
if this iron needs to get to the shoot to
[SPEAKER_03]: work in photosynthesis, once it's in place
in the protein, then it's safer and it
[SPEAKER_03]: will work on in that context and it's not
as reactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But transporting iron from the roots to
the sink part is a very, very challenging
[SPEAKER_03]: trip for iron and for the cells.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also I'd like to add about phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_09]: Phosphorus carries a lot of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_09]: So not only are you polluting the planet
and throwing your money away, you're also
[SPEAKER_09]: not thinking about the best interest of
your patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are some of the differences that
you've found in the different cultivars
[SPEAKER_09]: that you've worked with?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can go as far as analytically,
really the differences have been their
[SPEAKER_00]: affinity, speaking of metals, their
affinity for metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that depending on your cultivar,
you can feed a whole, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow with different cultivars,
the same nutrients over time, same
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, but at the end end up with
different residues of those levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: residues of those compounds in the
finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took a while to sort of figure out why
this is, but really it's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cultivar dependent, as we know this
plant is, you know, everybody knows it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bioaccumulator, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it generally holds onto these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I guess a rate at which they also
release is different and due to the just
[SPEAKER_00]: general vascular nature of the plant and
whatnot, I'm sure you guys are aware,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found that even through flushing,
you cannot get rid of them at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: rate through your different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've seen in situations,
something like cadmium, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain grower feeds the same nutrients,
everything's equal generally, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow one particular cultivar ends up
failing all the time for cadmium and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, scratching our head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's really no clear reason
apart from the fact that it just holds
[SPEAKER_00]: onto that a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's much more that can be
done to find that out, but that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really noticed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anyone tissue cultured it to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're getting that done now
after we've gone through exactly why that
[SPEAKER_00]: really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at the lab, we can only offer so
much analytical help and we'll help you
[SPEAKER_00]: figure that out, but you're going to have
to go through a tissue culture to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to that data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's very interesting because
cadmium usually accumulates when iron is
[SPEAKER_03]: deprived in the media, because when the
plant feels a lack of iron, the genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: programming of a plant is changing in
order to synthesize much more of a
[SPEAKER_03]: transporter to get this iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the roots are expanding and then there
are a lot of transporters to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: capture any atom of iron available.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there is no iron, you know,
the roots are still seeking for it,
[SPEAKER_03]: making a lot of transporters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the transporter is not
specific enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you have a lot of iron transporter
in the root system, but no iron to be
[SPEAKER_03]: captured, it will take up cadmium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the main effects of iron
deficiency is often a cadmium toxicity
[SPEAKER_03]: because the system is sucking cadmium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have cadmium contaminant in your
soil, in your substrate, then obviously if
[SPEAKER_03]: you have imbalance of iron, you will have
cadmium loading into the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So rather this is something to investigate
because perhaps it's related to that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we're learning up here.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess for me, the most evident nutrient
deficiency is I've been able to see
[SPEAKER_07]: between cultivars, you know, very evident,
very quantifiable is nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_07]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we have hundreds of different
phenotypes in our greenhouses and,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, we feed them one recipe.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it works for the majority of
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a couple of varieties that,
you know, it will very evidently show it's
[SPEAKER_07]: still hungry and it's got the classic
signs, of course, of nitrogen and others
[SPEAKER_07]: with magnesium.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, for us to make life
easy, because we want life easy as
[SPEAKER_07]: growers, you know, we'll take those
specific varieties and just do a top
[SPEAKER_07]: dress.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it gives it that little bit extra
boost.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as the whole greenhouse,
you know, we're able to just have,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, our certain stock tanks of just
a very easy one feed.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a, with your work on calcium,
could you talk about that foliar feeding,
[SPEAKER_09]: the different types of calcium and when to
apply it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: So calcium is one that we feed every
single week.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the amount that we feed it seems
crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like it could be toxic.
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of that work comes back from
research that my old major professor has
[SPEAKER_07]: done on certain things like petunias and
geraniums.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what he's been able to show is,
you know, with a certain foliar
[SPEAKER_07]: application of calcium, you know,
what we're doing is building cells,
[SPEAKER_07]: building a plant that's tough.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so whether that's, you know,
the infection of fungi, whether that's
[SPEAKER_07]: insects, you know, what we're doing is
building those cell walls.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, calcium in many forms,
if applied foliarly, thank goodness,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not toxic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we've shown in petunias and
what we're seeing now in cannabis is that
[SPEAKER_07]: you can apply rates every single week of
500 parts per million, which is a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think of what you might apply
through the roots, you know, it's 50.
[SPEAKER_07]: So significantly less.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to get toxicity.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just going to get uptake and really
build that plant's natural defense.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the one thing that is extremely
important to understand is that calcium is
[SPEAKER_07]: not just calcium.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's attached to something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the common forms are calcium
nitrate, and so nitrate, nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_07]: and calcium chloride, basically what you
put down when it's snowing to make you not
[SPEAKER_07]: slip.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it's getting more and more
popular for people to talk about crop
[SPEAKER_07]: steering, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a huge thing that people have known
for forever in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, certain nutrients, certain
things will make a plant steer more
[SPEAKER_07]: vegetative, and certain ones will make
them steer reproductive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, I guess the takeaway
here is if you're growing a vegetative
[SPEAKER_07]: plant, and whether this is in propagation
or as mother stock, you know, you want to
[SPEAKER_07]: apply calcium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_07]: This encourages that vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: This applies nitrogen that maybe you're
lacking from bottom feeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is the formula you want to apply.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we think about when switching to flour,
if you continue with that calcium nitrate
[SPEAKER_07]: for their application, your buds will be
funky.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll stretch out the plants thinking
I'm trying to flour, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: this nutrition regime is making me think
that I'm wanting to stay in the vegetative
[SPEAKER_07]: state.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the takeaway here is, you know,
go from calcium nitrate into flowering
[SPEAKER_07]: where you're at calcium chloride.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing, you know, up to 500 parts per
million calcium.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so far, it works very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, when it's going into flower and you
see those colas starting to stretch,
[SPEAKER_04]: is that similar to the monkey tailing,
which we know is more of a light stress
[SPEAKER_04]: signal?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how different is this from that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I've always called it fox tailing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like monkey though.
[SPEAKER_07]: In my experience, what I've seen with that
is it's kind of just the tip of the flower
[SPEAKER_07]: that's making this, you know, weird curl
and elongation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas when we see, when we apply calcium
nitrate, the whole flower is just kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: expanding.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even though in our research we see
higher yield, that's great if you're just
[SPEAKER_07]: going for extraction, but if you're going
for aesthetic, you're not going to sell
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very ugly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think it's a little bit different,
but same concept, which is a whole other
[SPEAKER_07]: rabbit hole we could jump down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Specifically, the CRC is, Cannabis
Research Coalition is going through
[SPEAKER_07]: lighting work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, what we're seeing,
everybody knows the two-week stretch.
[SPEAKER_07]: You flipped a short day, and there's a
stretch.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're seeing is that that stretch is
based off of cultivar-dependent,
[SPEAKER_07]: but also based off of how many hours is
your short day?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've switched directly from,
you know, 18 or 24 into eight hours,
[SPEAKER_07]: it doesn't expand as much.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't stretch as much.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go straight to 12 hours,
you know, you're going an extra third of
[SPEAKER_07]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, still tons to figure out,
but that's kind of what we're seeing on
[SPEAKER_07]: that side.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's dramatic, like from a yield
perspective, too, wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things, a common theme I've
heard here, I hear growers say,
[SPEAKER_09]: fertilizer is fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, it's not.
[SPEAKER_09]: The inputs and the forms of those inputs,
EDTA, DBTA, or EDDHA, let's say for iron,
[SPEAKER_09]: matters how the plant is going to uptake
it and use it calcium nitrate versus
[SPEAKER_09]: calcium chloride in flowering.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, would you agree with that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something interesting is now with the
knowledge we have about regarding,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, how genes are used in these
different nutritional status.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we know, for instance,
during iron deficiency, what genes are on
[SPEAKER_03]: in order to sanitize protein to take more
iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think with all this transcriptomic
analysis, we can have a diagnostic,
[SPEAKER_03]: basically, on the nutrient status of a
plant, for calcium, for iron, for any,
[SPEAKER_03]: for nitrate, for any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, now we have the access not only to
look at the plant or look at the final
[SPEAKER_03]: yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can, basically, in real time,
pretty much, a couple of hours,
[SPEAKER_03]: know exactly what the status is in
different developmental stage in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: optimize, basically, the whole nutrient
program during the whole development of a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think now we have very powerful
tools to improve our formulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're talking about looking at the
molecular level?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, what in research or anything that's
developed in cannabis gets you guys really
[SPEAKER_09]: excited?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited about the capabilities that we
have today to transfer some known
[SPEAKER_03]: mutations that could potentially make a
cultivar much more nutrient efficient just
[SPEAKER_03]: by taking mutations that are known in
different plants or in a specific cultivar
[SPEAKER_03]: that you don't have access to,
or you like these attributes, but you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't like all the other attributes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, to be able to take that specific gene
variant and to copy it in your own
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar of interest that you want to
improve.
[SPEAKER_03]: And using genome editing, which is a brand
new technique to make some genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: modification without being called a GMO,
is a very powerful technique that is
[SPEAKER_03]: opening a lot of avenues in order to
develop elite varieties that will use
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients in a much more efficient way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analytically, I'm really excited to move
away from THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take that the wrong way,
but the focus on THC is huge issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant provides so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you were in the medical
practicum or any of these talks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you keep hearing about whole plant
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how all these other components of the
plant help weather in just passage into
[SPEAKER_00]: the bloodstream and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm excited to refocus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really actually right now focusing on
flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's much more to be learned
about flavonoids, but in the nutritional
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, flavonoids have been known.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can buy vitamins that are
strictly flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're anti-inflammatory responses or
activity and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's plenty of them in the cannabis
plants, including cannabis-specific ones
[SPEAKER_00]: like Canflavin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I'm really doing a lot
of work on currently to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that nutrients and the
environment have an effect on those
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as much as nutrients have a huge impact
on your THC output and the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, so along with the other
components that are medically useful as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we really overlooked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've found is that those flavonoids
actually differ quite a bit from cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: to cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from seeing Canflavin at high residues
in some high THC components, separation
[SPEAKER_00]: between the A and B form and 17 other
flavonoids that I've seen so far is really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited for the industry to at
some point, hopefully in the near future,
[SPEAKER_00]: start to refocus on the whole plant
medicine rather than just high THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for me, it's photoperiodic response.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now, being in South Carolina,
I'm outdoors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not as easy as 18 hours,
12 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to understand at my latitude,
when will these plants initiate flower?
[SPEAKER_07]: When will they finish?
[SPEAKER_07]: When do I have to get my regulatory test
where I don't get charged for a federal
[SPEAKER_07]: crime for 1% THC?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to understand this backwards and
forwards.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what I'm seeing with the varieties
I deal with is that maybe not all auto
[SPEAKER_07]: flowers are actually truly not
photosensitive.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm seeing is, well, if you take that
auto flower and you put it at 18,
[SPEAKER_07]: 19, 20 hours, it's going to stay
vegetative.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that means it's not truly an auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with a plant like that, it's
special.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we understand the photoperiod and
we understand how to work that plant,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's special.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just for example sake, you have a
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: You take clones from it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep it vegetative.
[SPEAKER_07]: You plant it in your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't afford light depth.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to pull black cloth because
it's terribly annoying.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you raise the humidity and all sorts
of other problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, instead, you grow a, I'm coining
this term, I don't know, semi-auto.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trade market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is photoperiodic, but very different
than what we're used to.
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead, you're able to take clones
from this plant because you kept the mom
[SPEAKER_07]: at 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: You plant a greenhouse full of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All you have to do is put up, you know,
very inexpensive LED string lights all
[SPEAKER_07]: year round because nowhere in the US gets
over 18 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep those plants vegetative.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get them as big as you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: You turn those plants off and they flower
year round, back to back to back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's just, you know, understanding
how light affects those different
[SPEAKER_07]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we can really take advantage of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really save, you know, for the grower,
save time, save effort, and do what we
[SPEAKER_07]: need to do, but easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, I think one of the pleasures
has been seeing more and more scientists
[SPEAKER_04]: enter this industry and working with the
people who provided this industry to us,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're all here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of everybody before us,
and there's nothing more amusing to me to
[SPEAKER_04]: see somebody who's been in the industry
growing for 30 years start talking,
[SPEAKER_04]: already talking like a scientist,
but not getting the credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting to get more credit and still
talking the talk, and then more scientists
[SPEAKER_04]: talking like bros.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually been, it's been wild because
it's this merging of these worlds that
[SPEAKER_04]: should have always been together that we
now are able to start doing the research
[SPEAKER_04]: that we should have been doing for decades
and decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can start understanding regional
differences in our genetics, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: something that has been very hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know with doing hemp production and
selling clones or seeds nationwide,
[SPEAKER_04]: how is any one company going to have all
that data to be able to speak to you in
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington versus somebody or even really
truly understand the genetics and have the
[SPEAKER_04]: confidence behind the genetics to talk
about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the things that actually has
been nice to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what gets me excited about the
future of cannabis is marrying three
[SPEAKER_09]: technologies together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is number one, genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the growing environment and the
fertigation program.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is technologies out there with crop
steering that are more and more coming out
[SPEAKER_09]: all the time that will actually give the
grower godlike control in an indoor
[SPEAKER_09]: environment over the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that keeps me up at night and gets me
excited because once you put those three
[SPEAKER_09]: together, you can truly optimize that
plant to its true genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I add one more?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to add one more that I just,
because Justin and I were talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: this earlier before our panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think probably what motivates us as
a business, and I am kind of speaking for
[SPEAKER_04]: you here, but you said it too,
so that's why I'm making sure to dish out
[SPEAKER_04]: the credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's something that has always been a
part of my model and do currently with
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody, but we don't talk about it
enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually working with breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a tissue culture company,
yes, we can get into the idea of doing
[SPEAKER_04]: that biotech kind of breeding and the
hybridization and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But okay, we'll do that, but why would I
waste all my time only doing that and not
[SPEAKER_04]: actually working with these breeders that
have these amazing strains?
[SPEAKER_04]: And why would you want to work with us?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my argument for that is because
when you put your brand out, it needs to
[SPEAKER_04]: represent your brand and that plant or
that cultivar and its best possibilities,
[SPEAKER_04]: its full genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now when people are buying
clones from nurseries and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: diseased, is that representing your brand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, why not work with groups
like us where we can actually,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's your brand, it's just we're producing
those clean stock plants for your brand,
[SPEAKER_04]: through your brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do everything through licensing
royalties, MTAs, everything should be on
[SPEAKER_04]: the table and be an option.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that to me is going to be the most
exciting next two years for me personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going into a new lab in Arizona being able
to do that because no one group is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to have all the flavors of the rainbow.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many, so many good strains out
there and breeders who are not getting
[SPEAKER_04]: recognized because they may not be the big
10 seed packet going for a grand,
[SPEAKER_04]: but Danwell should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we can get more of that vegetative
material out with working with our groups.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's kind of a conflict between what's
called the legacy growers and what's
[SPEAKER_09]: happening now in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of them aren't coming out of the
woodwork and they absolutely should.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have absolutely, this killer strains,
some of these things going 42% THC,
[SPEAKER_09]: who knows what minor cannabinoids they
could have in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're right, there should be
licensing deals between companies and
[SPEAKER_09]: growers and they shouldn't be weary and
afraid of, as they call them, the suits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do think that there's not been any
favors done by previous mistakes out in
[SPEAKER_04]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the best that we can do is just
say, look, this is something that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can be transparent.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But damn, get out there, get your brand in
the market and let's represent it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: best possible way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a win-win for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's doing you justice to your work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not trying to be stolen from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for pointing that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what growers specific advice do you
have for the audience?
[SPEAKER_09]: Growers specific advice for the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if we talk about nutrition on the
nutrient formulation you are using,
[SPEAKER_03]: either you are using a commercial
formulation and you just have to follow
[SPEAKER_03]: the label.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you start playing with nutrient,
it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would warn you that as soon as you
change one nutrient quantity, perhaps in
[SPEAKER_03]: order to find the optimal dosage for high
run, let's say with one basic formulation,
[SPEAKER_03]: you identify 100 micromolar to be the
optimal concentration of iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you start then to change nitrate and
phosphate in the original formulation,
[SPEAKER_03]: now the optimal amount of iron will be
completely different because all the
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients or most of the nutrients are
interacting together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't actually today understand
exactly how they interact together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying to trick formulation on your own
is a very careful approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would definitely advise you to not
do that or just to do it scientifically
[SPEAKER_03]: with the proper approach, but not just
gamble on your crop by just changing one
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient because just 1.5 more iron as you
should, you kill your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying to optimize nutrient formulation
is a professional job, I would say,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have to have the capability and
many experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do it in your basement,
then obviously you might have had your
[SPEAKER_03]: prizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be my advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't play with nutrients as you wish.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going off of that, it's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the laboratory, we generally have
growers who want analysis of their
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, either what they've premixed or
what the soil around the plant or the
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, we end up missing the
whole picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to do a mass balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to, OK, what was your input?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's left around the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in the vascular part of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can take a root and we analyze
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's being flushed out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a sample of that and analyze that and
sort of see that mass balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, also making sure that your lab is
even testing for the right analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you say, the iron, the various iron
oxides and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure you're testing for the right
analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just test iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, which iron?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need all that information in
order to make an informed decision,
[SPEAKER_00]: as he was saying, to change a certain
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the full picture,
you go ahead and change something that
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps could be very detrimental to your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps you, especially when flushing as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're using a premix or you're
doing your own ratios, you need to know
[SPEAKER_00]: and get that whole picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that when you do ask your lab
for nutrient analysis that you're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: it from several different areas to get a
whole picture and do like a mass balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can make a better informed
decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say I appreciate these guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So 2016, which is and is not a long time
ago, I'm growing plants legally.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to take tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I spend days and hours on the phone
trying to find someone to take it and give
[SPEAKER_07]: me data.
[SPEAKER_07]: And no, cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what do I do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I dry it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I grind it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I send it off and say that it's
tomato.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I could do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they send me results back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, all right, this is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, usually when you get a report back,
they compare it to something.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they compared it to tomato.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, sure, it's a great starting point.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's some differences.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they're going to need something a
little different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so for years, all I had to go off of,
well, is this plant looks good.
[SPEAKER_07]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: I want my nutrients to match this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then you get into, well,
there's a million different varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's tough.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess my point is, you know,
I'm very grateful for him being involved
[SPEAKER_07]: has done a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's universities getting
involved that are testing thousands of
[SPEAKER_07]: plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're able to give you that bell
curve of, well, this is deficient.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is toxic.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the range you want to be in.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might not be perfect for your variety,
but it's at least a range we can work
[SPEAKER_07]: with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so not to brag on them again,
but Brian Whipker at NC State,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think just a month or two ago has put
out new standards of what we should,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, at least a rough range where we
should attempt to be in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, having analytical
testing, you know, all over the place now
[SPEAKER_07]: is amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I guess my advice would be use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, so I'm in the same boat in having
previously been CSO for analytical lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, first of all, and I'm going to
explain why, but dump your IPA,
[SPEAKER_04]: stop using IPA within your cultivation
facility, and I'll explain why in a
[SPEAKER_04]: second.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then second of all, get to know your
lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get to know your lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I had this guy, Francis,
call every morning, and he's a chef over
[SPEAKER_04]: in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he literally has turned himself into
an analytical chemist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because at 10 a.m., Aaron,
who's running the lab, he'd be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's Francis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would stop and he would take the
phone because Francis would ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's going to, this stuff isn't
intuitive for anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially when you're trying to dial
in, you want to be able to make a phone
[SPEAKER_04]: call and talk with your lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now that we can be out in the open
about what we are testing, I think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: important to know your lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that I learned by
knowing my lab is the substrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been having trouble with substrates,
Soilis, PCOR, and, you know, it's
[SPEAKER_04]: variation in what the starter charge is
going to be, which, I mean, the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: thing is really important, especially for
a tissue culture company, because I use a
[SPEAKER_04]: diluted nutrient solution on my hardening
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if I am, you know, transplanting my
cultures into a substrate that has
[SPEAKER_04]: terrible quality control or has
aspergillus is the biggest problem that I
[SPEAKER_04]: have seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aspergillus is that organism that has the,
that produces the aflatoxins that we have
[SPEAKER_04]: to test for from a compliant perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my advice is to test your substrates,
know your substrates, know your labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have never known that the
companies were having problems until I
[SPEAKER_04]: spent like 20 minutes in the lab when I
was dropping samples off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I happened to mention in passing,
and they said, we've been noticing the
[SPEAKER_04]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our farmers and the growers over in Yuma
are saying the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they actually called up the vendor or
some of their vendors and was asking,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was the cannabis industry that's
putting, you know, at the time,
[SPEAKER_04]: this was probably about four years ago,
was putting a stress on the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were having to source from
different areas and they didn't have time
[SPEAKER_04]: to keep up with everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have never known some of that
behind the curtain aspect if I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have known my lab and talked with my lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then does aspergillus, will IPA kill
aspergillus?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, will IPA kill virus?
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it kill aspergillus when you're in
your grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it does not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by putting your tools into IPA,
you're doing nothing to mitigate the
[SPEAKER_04]: spread of your viral loads, much less
you're doing very little to kill really
[SPEAKER_04]: what's plaguing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And aspergillus is a problem because I
would pasteurize my substrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I went straight on to sterilization
of my substrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the reason why, I totally understand
now in a different way than I did before.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why we test for aflatoxins,
most of the states, is because aspergillus
[SPEAKER_04]: can survive high heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can survive a lot of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not actually breaking that
cellular wall, you're not killing that
[SPEAKER_04]: microorganism.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will survive sterilization.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it survives sterilization and then
you moisten it, and in my lab I put it in
[SPEAKER_04]: a bin with a lid over it, well,
now there's no competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whew, aspergillus is, I mean, you could
see it through the bin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So test your substrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Know your labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're seeing that in cocoa and peat?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Both, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're failing consistently for
aflatoxin, look at your substrates.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to make growers aware that there
is a shift between micro and secondary
[SPEAKER_09]: nutrients between the growth and the
flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's quite dramatic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will affect your yields if you do
not get it correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's open it up for questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing a Q&A.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a few minutes left.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the panelists for a really
fascinating discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So question to the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: What approaches are you seeing,
if any, that use beneficial bacteria or
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi to influence plant nutrient uptake
and bioavailability?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's to the panel and to you as
well, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: You understand the question?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just where I heard you right, what bios
are used to help with nutrient uptake?
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything using bacteria or fungi to
affect how the plant takes up nutrients?
[SPEAKER_07]: So in my experience, you know,
we do a bit of contract research for,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, large-scale hemp production.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in hemp, you know, the prices are...
So we have to be very careful about what
[SPEAKER_07]: our inputs are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so two specific companies,
New Leaf, which is a bacteria,
[SPEAKER_07]: and Promix, which is a mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we did with them this past season
was, you know, you couldn't... You cannot
[SPEAKER_07]: take these products and apply them to 20
acres at a time, you know, every week.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would make no money.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what does make sense is taking your
clones and doing a significant drench
[SPEAKER_07]: prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's a one-time application.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we went through the steps,
you know, elemental analysis, yield,
[SPEAKER_07]: potency, dah, dah, dah, dah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we saw with these two specific
products, you know, there's many others
[SPEAKER_07]: out there, but with these two,
and it was consistent with the two,
[SPEAKER_07]: is that it did not increase potency,
it did not increase yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: But being in the Southeast, where it's hot
and crazy humid, and it doesn't get cold
[SPEAKER_07]: enough to kill most of the pathogens off
in the native soil, you know, we have
[SPEAKER_07]: terrible pathogen problem pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so... But what it did do is it
significantly reduced disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so for us, that was a huge win.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't just, well, you took up
nutrients X amount more.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, well, you basically saved the life
of this plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of the takeaway we
learned.
[SPEAKER_07]: In actuality, it did increase a few minor
nutrients, but that didn't equate to what
[SPEAKER_07]: the farmer wants being money, you know,
yield potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I may add one more thing to that,
just as you use that, be certain,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on your state or your
regulations, that it may lead to a
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial failure if they're looking for
total aerobic organisms and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, it wouldn't, because
they're looking specifically for pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: such as aspergillus and E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware that it doesn't get onto
your final end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to commend you for acknowledging
the role of legacy breeders and the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of integrating them into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to that end, since we have a fairly
big audience here, I just want to announce
[SPEAKER_01]: that tomorrow, last thing in the small
room, right before you go off and party
[SPEAKER_01]: for Cinco de Mayo, the impacts of
legalization on the cannabis legacy and
[SPEAKER_01]: the need for solutions to create a
healthier industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope some people will attend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just also put in a shameless plug
for my company Breeders Best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with Ethan Russo and Rob Clark,
and we're doing exactly what you talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about, bringing in genetics from legacy
breeders that have been doing this for
[SPEAKER_01]: decades and trying to find markets for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look us up, give us a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to put some genetics out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good plug.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there a preferred pH to the foliar
application that you were talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: with the CalMag?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I would imagine there are
extremes that would be detrimental to
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in my experience, in the broad range
of exceptions, there's been no difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to rely on you on that question
at the extremes of foliar nutrition and
[SPEAKER_07]: pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, obviously, I will confirm that the
two extremes are bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, for metals, you prefer rather
acidic, quite acidic, which is not good
[SPEAKER_03]: for other micronutrients like nitrate,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a thin balance between having a
good equilibrium for uptake of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather than optimizing for one,
but basically, you will deprive your plant
[SPEAKER_03]: of nitrate if you optimize only for metal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think plants have evolved to grow in
the kind of soil pHs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, there is some genetic
diversity depending on the type of soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants have been able to evolve within a
narrow window.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think obviously in the extreme,
below four, higher than eight,
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps it's more difficult for cannabis
to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the observation of the
semi-autos, would this be a symptom of the
[SPEAKER_05]: ruderalis autoflower blending in with
photoperiod plants, reducing the effect of
[SPEAKER_05]: the actual production of the hormone based
on overshadowing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is this technically a attribute that is
coming out as its individual statement?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the varieties I've worked with,
you know, it wasn't an intentional cross
[SPEAKER_07]: of ruderalis and photoperiodic variety.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a genetics question.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not necessarily my specialty.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would imagine so, but I'm unsure.
[SPEAKER_05]: In our personal garden, we've actually
been able to extend based on light
[SPEAKER_05]: intensity with autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: After a conversation, realizing that the
ruderalis started out as an undercrop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, as its competitors grew
taller, the overshadowing would hormonally
[SPEAKER_05]: trigger blooming.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just one of the reasons I was
asking if it's a cross between the two and
[SPEAKER_05]: attributes, because I know a lot of us in
the breeding culture to have taken the
[SPEAKER_05]: original landraces that breed in elongated
sectional timings, such as the indica is
[SPEAKER_05]: going 10 to 15 weeks and sativa is going
15 to 21 weeks or 25 in some regions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically shortening those by breeding
in ruderalis plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just interested to basically see if
that's a linkage in the instability we're
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing with hermaphroditic tendencies laid
in bloom, or if that's something that's
[SPEAKER_05]: just promoting based on our current
practices and being away from nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't hear every word.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit hard to hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, what I'm asking is,
are we creating instability by breeding in
[SPEAKER_05]: these two far reaches?
[SPEAKER_05]: And are we seeing that as an attribute to
the hermaphroditic tendencies in some
[SPEAKER_05]: plants that occur late in bloom?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not been able to correlate
hermaphrodism with, I guess, photoperiodic
[SPEAKER_07]: response.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're hybridizing just about
everything, whether it's photoperiodic
[SPEAKER_07]: response, purple color, whatever it may
be.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it really goes back to
homogenizing your genetic line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because sure, one cross of very extremes,
you're going to get a lot of different
[SPEAKER_07]: types of children.
[SPEAKER_07]: But picking that one you like and then
breeding to support those genetic traits
[SPEAKER_07]: you're looking for, I think that's what's
going to stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Until then, it's going to be up in the air
of what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that answer it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name's Ali.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm with Cannabis Talk 101.
[SPEAKER_08]: This question is primarily for Mike and
Iny, but I'd love to hear from all of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: How important is standardizing nutrients
to getting standardized medicine?
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you think there will ever be a day
that we will be able to get such
[SPEAKER_08]: consistency that we're almost at par with
pharmaceuticals?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've tested directly every competitor out
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've looked at the cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can manipulate cannabinoids by
macros, secondaries, and micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I talked earlier about marrying
genetics and crop steering and
[SPEAKER_09]: fertigation.
[SPEAKER_09]: That will give you what you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_09]: As well as lighting and environmental
controls and all the sensors will be
[SPEAKER_09]: involved.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll be able to steer that plant in many
different directions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's quite a bit of research that
has to be done.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just cracking the tip of the iceberg
when we think about cannabis and all of
[SPEAKER_09]: the different effects that would be the
possibilities when you look at the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was once in a production environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was pressing rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a bunch of new techs there
that he had to teach how to press the
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin out and do that whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really good at what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said that he couldn't really teach
that because the temperature, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to feel the pressure that you
press that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, OK, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not how it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be able to set a certain
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be able to set a certain PSI
of pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are what SOPs are necessary for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as we get legalization or
federally regulated, things have to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't just, I get it with the
master growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing it for years and they
know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the great challenge is to get that
written down in a strict, direct manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's essentially what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm creating a lab or setting up a
lab, I couldn't just put everything there
[SPEAKER_00]: and expect to do it all myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, why hire people?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to run all the essays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't even sit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to create SOPs for people to
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has to be the same thing that we
have to head towards in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're willing to or if you're going to
be able to produce consistent medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: with consistent THC levels, other
constituents, flavonoids, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: that growing process has to be
standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always situations where there's
disease and whatnot that could throw a
[SPEAKER_00]: wrench into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about shoot the corn we eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very standardized process of
growing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just shooting at the hip about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that I think saves our
ass when it comes to competing with the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical industry is the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if we're going to do something that
is plant-based and we want to mimic
[SPEAKER_04]: anything like what we have within those
trichomes, you can't do it by only
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetics, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's so much more research to
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do stand a chance in the industry,
in my mind, to be able to compete with
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody if we're willing to put the
investment and training behind proper
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities and HVAC is one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the biggest mistake that I've seen in
almost every facility that I go in is just
[SPEAKER_04]: a crappy job of HVAC or dealing with what
they have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it comes down to tracking the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need a baseline of genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the problems that I see with so
much of even the current literature that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're dealing with is until we have
markers and we know a strain is what it
[SPEAKER_04]: says it is, we have no baseline as an
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we have years of anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you work with your plants,
regardless of what its name is,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know its growing habit.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you replicate that on a commercial
scale?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then to be a commercial scale,
every commercial scale industry deals with
[SPEAKER_04]: new genetics coming in on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are so tied to our genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have clients that will never not,
will not get rid of a diseased plant
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's the last one that they have
and it's irreplaceable.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is terrible way to go about business.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we care about our genetics like
they're our children and our pets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's okay, but then we need to learn
to maintain them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have healthy plants and children,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's nothing wrong with our way.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need to melt some of additional
ways and finances into how to do that on a
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial scale and we can compete with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we've come to the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank our panelists today and
our audience as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
Thank you.
