[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to start by expressing my
appreciation for you, Stacey, for asking
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinarily relevant questions,
getting answers, driving this field
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are doing great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as my appreciation for all of you
here to learn and I'm sure take this
[SPEAKER_00]: message and spread it and to CanMed for
organizing this and having me back today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Dustin Sulak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an osteopathic general practitioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been practicing cannabis medicine in
Maine for the last 10 years and it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: an incredible gift to myself and my
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, we've got the slides up here,
but I don't see them down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll just dig right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm talking about cannabis and
its role in integrative medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: health promotion, and disease prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to begin with, well, here's an
overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrative medicine principles we'll just
go through as a roadmap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think probably a lot of you aren't
aware of these principles, which are a
[SPEAKER_00]: great solution to some of the biggest
challenges we have in healthcare today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And demonstrate a really nice example of
how cannabis is not just helping patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also helping change medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also touch on psychoactive adverse
effects and psychoactive benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural acidic cannabinoids, they're
bioavailability dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have time, a bit of their use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to use cannabis to prevent
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start off with a little
attention to a very big problem that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have here in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are doing a terrible job taking care of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our healthcare system per capita spent
10,000, we spent over $10,000 per person
[SPEAKER_00]: per year on healthcare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost 18% of our gross domestic
product totaling 3.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: $3 trillion spent in this country on
healthcare.
[SPEAKER_00]: But despite spending more on healthcare
than any other country, we fail miserably.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rank last or near last on dimensions of
healthy lives, access to healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency, and healthcare equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually in 2013, the Institute of
Medicine reported that we have worse
[SPEAKER_00]: health and premature death rates than any
other country at every age group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every income level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are clearly spending a lot of money and
doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the solution to this problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well they're actually, let me start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the contributing factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many, but I believe that one is
this over reliance on monomolecular
[SPEAKER_00]: therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that we are complex systems with
multiple redundant pathways and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes for each disease state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea of using a single molecule to
influence that system in a direction
[SPEAKER_00]: towards health, it works sometimes,
but it doesn't work a lot of the times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really overuse that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to manage chronic disease instead
of prevent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole healthcare infrastructure
and the economics of healthcare really
[SPEAKER_00]: promote a benefit to the system when
people are sick and their disease is
[SPEAKER_00]: managed, not when it's cured or prevented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the incentives are all backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many other contributing
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you'll see many times in this
presentation, I give a nod to one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: beloved mentors and friends, Andrew Weil,
who has, I just respect him so deeply for
[SPEAKER_00]: profoundly changing the direction and
trajectory of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I believe what he said 20 years
ago, at some point integrative medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: will simply be called good medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're starting to see that become
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are eight principles that have
been identified by a consortium of
[SPEAKER_00]: integrative medicine establishments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to walk through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is a partnership between patient
and practitioner in the healing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: A partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's kind of new to
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be this kind of top down,
I'm the doctor, I'm going to tell you what
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not work with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's so many different forms,
as Stacey pointed out, so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of cannabis, delivery methods,
individual response to the need for dose
[SPEAKER_00]: titration to find someone's optimal dose,
an optimal regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of back and forth between
patient and practitioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real partnership in the healing
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is essential in getting great results
with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients become empowered to feel like
they have the reins on their own health
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It improves their self-care because now
they're making those decisions,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're administering the cannabis to
themselves, they're taking notes,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in my practice, and building
self-awareness, which leads to
[SPEAKER_00]: self-efficacy, a can-do attitude,
a feeling like they can get better and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can participate in their healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the therapeutic
horticulture, which is an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of cannabis that's often not
mentioned, but when a patient can take a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed or a cutting and put it in their
backyard and watch the plant grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrate its growth and look at the
beauty of this plant and then heart and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest it and produce a medicine in their
home that's cost-effective that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: use for the whole year and take care of
themselves, that is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is empowerment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for everyone in here that's involved
in the cannabis industry, if you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: influence in politics and lobbying,
please, there's many states right now
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's still not legal for patients to
grow and produce their own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it helps or hurts your bottom
line, as a community, we all have to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote that availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture from my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second principle is the appropriate
use of conventional and alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: methods to facilitate the body's innate
healing response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that medicine often
overlooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focused on the disease, not on the
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: The founder of osteopathy said anyone can
find that disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The job of the physician is to find the
health in the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're talking about innate healing
response, the question is what can we do
[SPEAKER_00]: to support that innate healing response
and what can we do to remove obstructions
[SPEAKER_00]: from that innate healing response?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone have an idea of a system that might
be a good target for doing just that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, the endocannabinoid system involved
in every disease and every symptom known
[SPEAKER_00]: to man, widely distributed throughout our
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, CB1 and CB2 receptors
addressing the endocannabinoid system to
[SPEAKER_00]: help treat disease and promote health via
enhancing our innate healing response
[SPEAKER_00]: makes perfect sense, and we've got a great
tool to be able to target this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in our backyards, if that's possible,
and it's available more and more now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't necessarily need fancy
pharmaceutical drugs to target this
[SPEAKER_00]: system, even though there's a place for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third principle is the consideration
of all factors that influence health,
[SPEAKER_00]: wellness, and disease, including mind,
spirit, and community, in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to focus on mind, spirit,
and community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the psychoactive adverse effects versus
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the adverse effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Impaired memory, confusion, anxiety,
paranoia, discoordination, dizziness,
[SPEAKER_00]: being tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things I see as side effects in
my practice, typically related to
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive doses of THC and also related to
factors in set and setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is someone's internal mindset?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they expecting out of cannabis,
and what are their goals and intentions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's their external setting?
[SPEAKER_00]: That influences a person's response to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are usually mild and self-limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will complain of residual
effects the following day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are the psychoactive benefits of
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to begin with, this euphoria,
which has been described as a side effect
[SPEAKER_00]: in many papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, this is a gift to patients
that are suffering if we can help them
[SPEAKER_00]: feel positive mood, relaxation,
laughter, socializing, time distortion,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows them to come into the present
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the intensification of ordinary
experiences, which can be leveraged for a
[SPEAKER_00]: practice of mindfulness called savoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Savoring is a direct antidote to
anhedonia, which is a major culprit in
[SPEAKER_00]: depression and especially opioid use
disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people are no longer able to
experience pleasure, from the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: things in their life that should give them
pleasure, then they go seeking something
[SPEAKER_00]: that temporarily gives them a stronger
pleasure signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a downward spiral into just
having to use a drug or a substance to
[SPEAKER_00]: feel normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis can absolutely break that cycle,
especially THC, when used intentionally to
[SPEAKER_00]: support a process of savoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can restore the natural pleasure
they get from these healthy activities in
[SPEAKER_00]: their lives, including eating,
listening to music, having sex,
[SPEAKER_00]: just connecting, taking a walk,
smelling the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's also something I've seen over
and over again in my patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: this unbundling of symptoms and suffering,
where they first come in and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: this ball of suffering and they feel like
they need to escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after experiencing the psychoactive
effects of THC dominant cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced THC CBD cannabis, they're able to
tease this apart and they realize there's
[SPEAKER_00]: this sensation that's more neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the past, they felt like that
sensation was a really bad thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now they're not judging it as much
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not suffering as much from it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less anxiety about continuing to have that
sensation that's now more neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then less of the pain behavior
associated with that, which impacts their
[SPEAKER_00]: whole family and their whole community.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unbundling is an essential gift of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this return to normality.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the cannabis clinicians and
caretakers and dispensary agents,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room, I wonder how many times
you've heard someone say, this plant has
[SPEAKER_00]: given me my life back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I see a show of hands?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I thought it was like a planted
phrase that patients were told to tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: because it just happened so many times
again and again, I've gotten my life back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is really what people say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was described in a qualitative
study that came out of Israel and they
[SPEAKER_00]: called it restored self, a return to
normality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel like they've lost their lives
and cannabis gives them their lives back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting is people report
this even when their symptoms don't
[SPEAKER_00]: improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their pain, their anxiety, all their
symptoms could be the same, but they still
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like cannabis has given them their
life back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, that's, I went backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are patients reporting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased self-awareness, a sense of
connection to God and nature and the
[SPEAKER_00]: universe, viewing oneself from a different
vantage point.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all really profound things that
no pharmaceutical medication will just
[SPEAKER_00]: give to someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes on and on, feeling of
acceptance of their place in life and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding creative solutions to their
problems and this mental, emotional and
[SPEAKER_00]: physical capacity to change, which is
likely correlated with enhanced
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroplasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people experience this during the
acute effects of THC, but these gifts
[SPEAKER_00]: persist after the THC wears off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take this with them the next day and
the next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a change in their relationship
with themselves and with the world around
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is profound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to get this without the psychoactive
effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's community, the cannabis
community, which we are all here together
[SPEAKER_00]: in this cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that all of you that are new to
the community continue to have this
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of, wow, the cannabis community
is really something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: People care.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are altruistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're willing to help to lift each other
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot less greed, a lot less
selfishness and more giving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the spirit of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that any of you have a chance
to experience this and that all of you can
[SPEAKER_00]: become a part of that and contribute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you let cannabis in and let it
teach you how to live, it teaches this
[SPEAKER_00]: community, which is really essential,
not just for fixing our health care
[SPEAKER_00]: system, but for healing our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to get into all the
big problems in the world, but community
[SPEAKER_00]: is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So principles number four and five,
a philosophy that neither rejects
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional medicine nor accepts
alternative therapies uncritically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the recognition that good medicine
should be based in good science,
[SPEAKER_00]: be inquiry driven, and be open to new
paradigms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, we have some pretty good
data, nicely summarized by the 2017
[SPEAKER_00]: National Academy's report, and there's
conclusive evidence that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for chronic pain,
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple sclerosis spasticity,
at least subjective symptoms, and moderate
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids
associated with improvements in sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes out of big clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a start, but this is a very early
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need new paradigms of thought,
including what Dr. Gruber has been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she's, you know how I feel about
her work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to mention that this doesn't
all have to be limited to artisanal and
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concepts that we're learning here in
cannabis medicine using the herb can be
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to the pharmaceutical industry,
to drug research and drug development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a perfect template for that,
something called network pharmacology,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a newish approach to drug
discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it involves network analysis to
determine a whole set of proteins critical
[SPEAKER_00]: in any disease, and then chemical biology
to identify molecules capable of targeting
[SPEAKER_00]: that set of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually a multifactorial treatment
that involves multiple compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one example of a Chinese medicine,
Qi Shen Yi Qi, which treats heart attack
[SPEAKER_00]: and other heart disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here all the different
pathways, the different genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted, and the different molecules
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the type of systems biology we
need to take pharmaceutical drug
[SPEAKER_00]: development to the next level and stop
looking for a single molecule and hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to solve all our problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't worked, and I don't think it's
going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Principle number six is the use of
natural, effective, and less invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: interventions whenever possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has cannabis demonstrated any of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to begin with, when I was 19 years
old, I read through this report from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after it came out, I was involved in
cannabis activism, and I was so happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: get this quote on my flyers when I was
tabling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for the harms associated with
smoking, the adverse effects of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: use are within the range tolerated for
other medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: No fatal overdose, no organ damage,
no permanent cognitive deficits in adult
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy users, and actually improved neural
cognition in medical users.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very low risk for abuse, especially with
medical preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is less invasive and less dangerous
than narcotics and opiates, anxiolytics,
[SPEAKER_00]: antidepressants, non-steroidals,
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the drugs that people are using
cannabis to substitute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much safer for the population,
a great example of integrative medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to principle number seven,
use of the broader concepts of promotion
[SPEAKER_00]: of health and prevention of illness as
well as the treatment of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about promoting health and
preventing illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can look at some of the leading
causes of death, and we'll just start with
[SPEAKER_00]: heart disease since that's high up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this conversation around cannabis
applies to cancer, accidents, strokes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and perhaps lower respiratory disease as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's an interesting study where two
micrograms per kilogram of body weight of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC was administered by injection to mice
two hours before giving them a heart
[SPEAKER_00]: attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this tiny, tiny dose of THC,
which most of you would expect to do
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing, which I would expect to do
nothing, ended up protecting the heart
[SPEAKER_00]: from the heart attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improved fractional shortening,
decreased the release of troponin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an enzyme that shows us that
heart cells are in trouble, decreased the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the dead cells in the heart,
and decreased the inflammation and
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation of neutrophils to the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two micrograms per kilogram I can't
emphasize enough how tiny of a dose that
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this dose has been shown in two other
animal studies to have effects both on
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting the brain and protecting the
liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you that know my work know I'm
extraordinarily interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ultra-low dosing range of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something special happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does this work out in humans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do people walking around with tiny bits of
THC in their system actually have better
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes after heart attack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on this observational data of over a
million people comparing those who
[SPEAKER_00]: self-reported using cannabis to those who
didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that after having a heart
attack, those who were cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: self-reporters were less likely to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were less likely to have invasive
interventions like intra-arterial balloon
[SPEAKER_00]: pump and percutaneous interventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were more likely to be put on a
ventilator, likely because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis smokers and had some impairment
in their respiratory function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do we know direction of causality
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an association between
self-reported cannabis use and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: better after a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a good lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: The preclinical data supports it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about preventing the steps that
lead up to a heart attack, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, it's not just enough to
protect someone when they have a heart
[SPEAKER_00]: attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually want to prevent that from
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to look at atherosclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Atherosclerosis, it turns out that a
fairly low dose of THC in rodents can
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent the development or at least slow
down the development of atherosclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a CB2-dependent process,
so THC could help with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beta-karyophylline could help with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, in general, an anti-inflammatory
and tissue protective activity that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening inside the blood vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving from heart disease to brain injury,
some more human observational data,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at people who come into the
hospital with a traumatic brain injury and
[SPEAKER_00]: dividing them into those that have THC in
their system and those that don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those without THC, 11.5% of them died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those with THC, only 2.4% died.
[SPEAKER_00]: What might be causing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have a little bit of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard Dr. Mishulam speaking about it
yesterday that the cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotective agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that most of us in this room
that really recognize this have kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plan that we've told our significant
others about, hey, if this ever happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to get some of these
cannabinoids in my system ASAP because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's likely that they're protective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we could just keep low levels in our
systems anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another observational study
looking at brain bleeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see that in the
cannabis negative group, only 3% had no
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: 19% in the cannabis group survived that
brain bleed with no symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that whole cannabis group
on the top is shifted over to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a neuroprotective effect that is
showing up in human patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about obesity and diabetes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these a big deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this worth talking about with disease
prevention and health promotion?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what's happening on the map
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at what's happened to our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've become a country of obese and
diabetic individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical cost of diabetes and obesity
is looking like over $300 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was several years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's probably $400 or $500
billion now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to help put that into perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2008, the UN estimated the cost for
feeding every hungry person in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: for eliminating hunger in the world,
$30 billion per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we would all get together as a
global community and spend $30 billion a
[SPEAKER_00]: year for 10 years in a row, there would be
a sustainable infrastructure to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: starvation and hunger ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing instead?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're overfeeding ourselves with a bunch
of crap and then spending hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: billions of dollars on the sequelae.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also do like to put that into
perspective compared to our US annual
[SPEAKER_00]: defense budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what if our defense strategy was to
eliminate poverty and to eliminate hunger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that would make us safer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that might help end war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's the new mission someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cannabis use is associated with a
lower incidence of obesity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see from two large data sets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also associated with a lower incidence of
diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just in the last year,
we've had a lot more data come out showing
[SPEAKER_00]: this is from the Pittsburgh Youth Study,
which followed people over more than 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years and found that greater cannabis use
was associated with improvements in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these cardio metabolic risk factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This beats the pants off of a statin drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, no direction of causality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an association.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the data comes up again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it is just that cannabis users are
more likely to go exercise and be runners
[SPEAKER_00]: and make healthier choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's a direct physiologic cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it's some combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the cannabis is actually helping
people wake up and realize that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful and they are lovable and they're
worth taking care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes sense to make the right
choices to support a healthy and happy
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is there a preclinical basis for a
causal effect of cannabis preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: obesity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take mice and give them an
obesogenic diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's given in the presence of
THC, they do not become obese.
[SPEAKER_00]: They maintain their normal weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that maybe we're starting,
you know, this isn't a cure-all,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think that cannabis is likely to
help most people with their metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: function and their metabolic physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started my practice as a cannabis
clinician, I was very scared that my
[SPEAKER_00]: overweight patients were going to get more
overweight, that they'd get the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the major potential
side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have not seen that in a decade of
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people's weight normalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that are overweight lose weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that are underweight gain weight,
cannabis is this great homeostatic
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's doing that at this level as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to use cannabis for health?
[SPEAKER_00]: How to use cannabis for health promotion
and disease prevention?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a metaphor that I use with a
lot of my patients, so I'll walk you
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis can be a crutch, and cannabis can
be a tonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when someone breaks their leg,
if they want to still move about,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do need to get the weight off of that
fracture, because if they don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they use a crutch for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now able to walk around and let
that leg heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they never stop using the crutch,
the leg will not finish its healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because it's the force vectors
going through the bone and the connective
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue that actually stimulate those final
stages of knitting together and healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, they have to put down
the crutch and start bearing weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have to do that with cannabis as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our sickest patients can use cannabis in a
way that helps them manage and helps get
[SPEAKER_00]: through their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as they start to heal,
they tend to shift their cannabis use
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns and need less of it and use it in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, they're feeling so good,
it's no longer a crutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis becomes a tonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a tonic or an adaptogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: A tonic is a compound or a substance or
perhaps a practice that improves our
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience to stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in an incredibly toxic
environment, chemically toxic,
[SPEAKER_00]: socially and psychologically toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many challenges to being
healthy nowadays that I think a lot of us
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize we need to rely on botanical
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to support our health and to stay
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does it look like when cannabis is
used as a tonic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, I recommend strongly
using the lowest effective dose because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're building tolerance to THC,
then you're likely building tolerance to
[SPEAKER_00]: your endocannabinoids and you're
undermining the efficacy of your primary
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostatic modulatory system,
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't build tolerance to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the lowest effective dose and many of
you would be surprised how low that dose
[SPEAKER_00]: can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two is use cannabis to promote
restorative sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my primary goal in any of my
patients that aren't sleeping well.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC works so well for sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use cannabis to reduce stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use cannabis to enhance health promoting
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is not to be used as a
pharmaceutical medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can act that way but it's even more
powerful as an adjunct to other
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments, an adjunct to lifestyle change
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis with exercise, cannabis with
meditation and with the savoring practice
[SPEAKER_00]: I described earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incorporate the psychoactive benefits into
your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a lot of my patients that come in
and say, I don't want to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never want to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you sleeping terribly?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start using a little THC
right before bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come back three months later.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sleeping beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is, okay, once or twice a
week when you don't have much going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the evening, take that THC dose from
bedtime and bump it up to dinnertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like let me know how you feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come back, oh, that was so
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like I thought it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was some like psychedelic
hallucinatory thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it just felt good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it way better than two glasses of
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people come back and tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then avoid or limit combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that avoiding combustion in my
mind means avoiding so-called vape pens or
[SPEAKER_00]: combustion pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't need to say any more about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're having a toke once or twice
a day or once or twice a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's really hurting your
lungs very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the dry flour, the herbal vaporizers
are probably the best way to inhale
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis if inhalation is a desired route.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I want to end up with
raw cannabis, which I think from an
[SPEAKER_00]: ethnobotanical standpoint and based on my
own experience in myself and in my
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, it's the raw cannabis that is
the best form of cannabis as a tonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use cannabis to stay
healthy and to prevent disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some of the first
pharmacokinetic data of oral absorption of
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA and CBDA in just nine people with
medication overuse headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they took like a type two variety of
cannabis, had some THC, some CBD in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: made into a decoction, which is like a
tea, except it's covered and simmered for
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit in water or in oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see these are the
pharmacokinetic data showing the
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might notice one peak that really
stands out there in orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left, we have the decoction,
and on the right, we have the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That orange peak is THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA is being absorbed far more than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this one, CBDA,
look at the bioavailability of CBDA
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top of the slide here, you can see
what the actual composition of the oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: the decoction look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did the math for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the areas under the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the decoction, THCA was absorbed 50
times better than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA was absorbed five times better than
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the oil, THCA was absorbed 32 times
better than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the oil, CBDA was absorbed 11 times
better than CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: High bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we use cannabis to promote health
and prevent disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these pictures aren't actually that
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stop taking pictures of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a little bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, it's a type 2 variety that has
some CBDA and THCA in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in your mug, and you pour the
hot water on top of it, or the hot coffee,
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever tea, however you like your hot
beverage in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Include a little nugget in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're done drinking it,
if you're willing, take that thing and eat
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By little bud, I mean something about the
size of a pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't need much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what my patients tell me is when they
start doing this, they don't notice much
[SPEAKER_00]: until about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then their arthritis starts feeling
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their resilience to stress starts
improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not as fast acting as the
decarboxylated cannabinoids, but
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinarily powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage you to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try incorporating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a place for stabilized
acidic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trust me, if you've got some of these
buds in your cabinet or in your fridge,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can absolutely take those and start
using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using them right now without waiting
for a pharmaceutical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right there at home, the acidic
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I'd like to end up with
principle number eight, training of
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioners to be models of health and
healing, committed to the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: self-exploration and self-development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that as a cannabis expert,
a physician, an educator, and a steward of
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant, that I am walking my talk and
living this principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
