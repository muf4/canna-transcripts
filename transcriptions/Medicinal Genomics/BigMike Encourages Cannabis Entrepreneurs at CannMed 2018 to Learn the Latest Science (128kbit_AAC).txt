[SPEAKER_00]: How is Big Ag and Big Pharma going to
alter the marketplace for young
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs who want to get in the
cannabis business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Ag and Big Pharma are already here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tremendous amount of opportunity
as our industry grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of small businesses that are
going to be acquired by Big Ag and Big
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get into the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a good company with some solid
management and a great vision and go to
[SPEAKER_00]: work for them because the odds of them
getting acquired are really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to probably be a minimum
of a core million to half a million jobs,
[SPEAKER_00]: new jobs, that will be created here in
America over the next several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be where I am today if it
wasn't for hard studying, and reading a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of books, and finding great scientists
to talk to and share different ideas with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to encourage all the young
entrepreneurs and business owners who want
[SPEAKER_00]: to get into the cannabis space to pursue
the science aspect of cannabis just like I
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where I made the biggest gains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I had science behind me,
advanced nutrients, Big Mike's blends,
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to grow at a faster, better rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science has always been the answer to
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, that's what I like about
CanMed because the best cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers in the world are going to be
right here in Los Angeles at UCLA October
[SPEAKER_00]: 22nd through 24th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be on one of the panels
there speaking, and I'm really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing new ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of all, I love to talk about the
future of cannabis because it isn't what a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will see you October 22nd through 24th
at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
Thank you.
Thank you.
