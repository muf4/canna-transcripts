[SPEAKER_02]: Hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming to my talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna be talking about cannabis
medicine for children.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you guys all know my background so
I'm not gonna spend any time on that but I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to do something a little bit
different today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just even for my own entertainment
to mix it up a little bit because I talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about a lot of the same things over and
over and I'm sorry to those who were here
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday for the practicum there will be a
little overlap but I do try to go into
[SPEAKER_02]: more detail since I have a little more
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to start with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing this now about 14 years
and I've been a physician for 30 plus
[SPEAKER_02]: years and I just want to share with you
all a few things I've learned working with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and working with sick people
including very sick children.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is like my favorite part of my
show right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we all do what we do and thank
you to all the researchers to medical
[SPEAKER_02]: genomics for putting on this conference
for all the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: For everybody here who does their part in
cannabis I know we're all like-minded and
[SPEAKER_02]: these are the most vulnerable patients and
some of these kids have cancer,
[SPEAKER_02]: some have epilepsy, some have autism,
some have you know irreversible brain
[SPEAKER_02]: damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we all should be doing what
we're doing and I know we all have our
[SPEAKER_02]: stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our mother was sick or our best
friend or our brother but really this is
[SPEAKER_02]: what drives me to try to make it better,
to try to get better products,
[SPEAKER_02]: to try to get more research and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to tell you about a few
things I've learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry about that other thing shouldn't
be there but I guess I screwed up on my
[SPEAKER_02]: animations but what have I learned?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is good medicine right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you could say it's great medicine but
I say good medicine I'm talking about you
[SPEAKER_02]: know when you say oh that that's a good
person or she's good people this is good
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it good medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we routinely witness improvements
in symptoms and quality of life even when
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't even know what you're doing with
it right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go in and buy some cannabis and
walk out and you say oh you know I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know what I was doing I slept great and I
was nicer to my husband the next day and I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't yell at the kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people are able to lower doses or
discontinue other medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many here know somebody whether it's a
family member yourself or somebody you've
[SPEAKER_02]: helped raise your hand if you know
somebody has been able to stop or lower
[SPEAKER_02]: dose of other medication right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just about everybody who's worked with
patients or just even talking to people
[SPEAKER_02]: and then also patient satisfaction is
exceptionally high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to say this anecdotally but
there was a study back in 2014 86% I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know of any other drug where you get an
86% patient satisfaction and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: because even if you miss your dose of
cannabis probably likely nothing bad is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to happen if you overdose on it
likely nothing bad is going to happen so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a very easy medicine to work with and
I'm still kind of I think I said this on
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday I'm kind of over it already trying
to convince people this we have enough
[SPEAKER_02]: data and enough research to show that
patients want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a study out of Stacey Gruber's
group with I think it's how you say cigar
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 months of medical cannabis resulted in
significant improvements on measures of
[SPEAKER_02]: executive function and clinical state
including sleep pain and quality of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are people who were measured and
tested and Stacey talks about them being
[SPEAKER_02]: the most studied group of patients on the
planet before they start medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and then she measured it at three months
six months and here's her 12 months study
[SPEAKER_02]: that came out last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clinical improvement was associated with
higher CBD use cognitive improvements were
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with clinical improvement and
what they concluded was medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: patients may exhibit enhanced rather than
impaired executive function over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see this over and over I see this in my
pediatric patients they take mega high
[SPEAKER_02]: doses of cannabis and guess what they can
finally get back to school and learning
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the exact opposite of what we have
been taught and what we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: propagandized over all these years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second thing I've learned medical cannabis
is safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you could argue with me about
problematic use or misuse that's fine but
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about medical cannabis someone
who is using it specifically to treat
[SPEAKER_02]: medical condition and so I wanted to show
you kind of world we live in so when you
[SPEAKER_02]: think about medical cannabis and people
get really I still get from people really
[SPEAKER_02]: oh is it safe I don't know the world we
live in has drugs that are so scary look
[SPEAKER_02]: at this a new anti epileptic medication is
linked to turning you blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something called blue person
syndrome okay now luckily this came this
[SPEAKER_02]: was taken off the market but how this got
through our regulatory institutions is
[SPEAKER_02]: beyond me I mean I guess it's okay if you
want to be blue but I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this one painful erections while
being treated for OCD I don't know you
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about trading one condition for
another yes this is a great one warning
[SPEAKER_02]: this Parkinson's drug can make you
addicted to gambling sex or food so I read
[SPEAKER_02]: this article and this poor elderly woman
who's struggling with Parkinson's turns
[SPEAKER_02]: into a gambling addict.
[SPEAKER_02]: She lost two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars at the local casino on the slots
[SPEAKER_02]: and when they discontinued the drug guess
what she never gambled again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet this is acceptable and I find that
fascinating and then here's my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody loss of fingerprints okay and
this is with a cancer drug and luckily
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully none of you ever have to take
this but I don't know you know pick your
[SPEAKER_02]: poison right cannabis doesn't do any of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help with the slides am I doing something
wrong it's stuck how do I unstuck it oh
[SPEAKER_02]: there we go okay so I just pulled out a
few articles in any anybody who sits and
[SPEAKER_02]: read the reads this medical cannabis
literature you're going to see these words
[SPEAKER_02]: over and over and over again safe and
efficacious well-tolerated mild side
[SPEAKER_02]: effects we really don't see blue person or
loss of fingerprints or gambling
[SPEAKER_02]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a study that showed 27 over 2,700
elderly patients safe and efficacious and
[SPEAKER_02]: look what it says cannabis use may
decrease the use of other prescription
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines including opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another one 2,900 cancer patients
cannabis just for palliation well
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerated effective and safe but 95.9
reported improvement in their condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another one this is 367
fibromyalgia patients medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: appears to be safe and effective and
here's another one yeah for autism that
[SPEAKER_02]: just came out this year review of cannabis
for autism cannabinoid therapy for autism
[SPEAKER_02]: is associated with low adverse side
effects and reduction in concomitant
[SPEAKER_02]: medication and if you read through the
literature and even if you just sat for an
[SPEAKER_02]: hour looking you're going to see these
same words over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this idea that cannabis medicine is
fringe that it is should be last resort
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's just a bunch of nonsense this
medicine is safe and well tolerated
[SPEAKER_02]: especially under medical supervision and
even without medical supervision it's
[SPEAKER_02]: usually very safe and well tolerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we keep it safe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright so see somebody who does a medical
history so they know what drugs you're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking they know what treatments you tried
they do a physical exam a review of all
[SPEAKER_02]: your medications and lifestyle prior to
onset so you can get the best result
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only use tested products that have a
transparent COA if you don't know what's
[SPEAKER_02]: in it and you can't reproduce that it's
unlikely to be sustainable medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a patient who a pediatric patient
who has seizures in fact his pictures one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the pictures on my initial slide and
his mother was afraid to tell me this but
[SPEAKER_02]: she eventually told me that she was taking
the oils like I had recommended and then a
[SPEAKER_02]: cousin handed her a little bit of RSO oil
and she just decided to give it to him and
[SPEAKER_02]: he had a significant reductions in
seizures had she told me about it we could
[SPEAKER_02]: have gotten it tested and figured out what
it was she used it up told me about it six
[SPEAKER_02]: months later and I was like well that's
really not medicine because you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: it anymore so it's very important that
we're using products that we know what's
[SPEAKER_02]: in it we know that it's reproducible and
consistent over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start low and go slow hydration prevents
THC dosing errors this is important in
[SPEAKER_02]: pediatrics and elderly patients and really
anybody who is still a little skeptical
[SPEAKER_02]: just this past Thanksgiving I have friends
who I've told them never give a gummy to
[SPEAKER_02]: an elderly person without cutting it into
pieces but they didn't listen they gave a
[SPEAKER_02]: night before Thanksgiving he gave his
mother with sleep problems and anxiety and
[SPEAKER_02]: depression a 10 milligram gummy and she
basically had a terrible reaction
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanksgiving was canceled the next day and
they just kind of babysat her but now
[SPEAKER_02]: she's turned off to it so remember start
low and go slow especially in those
[SPEAKER_02]: patients who are cannabis naive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Side effects are very rare with
non-impairing cannabinoids like CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG, CBDA and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also side effects are easily mitigated
everybody's heard me say this change the
[SPEAKER_02]: dose change the timing change the product
you can mitigate you don't have to have
[SPEAKER_02]: side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: First time you're trying something new or
someone you know is trying something new
[SPEAKER_02]: they should be at home they shouldn't have
like a test in two hours right or you know
[SPEAKER_02]: you're meeting the in-laws for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to try it at home first see how
you feel even something that you know may
[SPEAKER_02]: be non-impairing you may you may be
sensitive to it so it's important to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: it safe that way and then get help if you
don't know where to start or you haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: found relief there's so many health care
practitioners here today there's so many
[SPEAKER_02]: nurses and nurse practitioners so many
people to ask for help so please ask for
[SPEAKER_02]: help if you're not sure what you're doing
or if you think you're doing it right and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not getting relief it's helpful to
bounce it off someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright everybody knows this one treat the
patient not the diagnosis we do like to
[SPEAKER_02]: have an understanding of if you have this
condition or that condition that maybe you
[SPEAKER_02]: should go in this direction or that
direction is dictated by clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: experience or by the latest scientific
information but in general we know
[SPEAKER_02]: personalized individual regimens based on
a patient's response is the way to go with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and one size does not fit all and
I'm just going to show you this slide here
[SPEAKER_02]: this is I'm going to be talking about this
this comes from my autism research and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see the patients age 6 to 12 kind of
listed and what sex they are in their
[SPEAKER_02]: dosages per day but if you look at the
cannabinoid content these are all children
[SPEAKER_02]: with autism we these are none of these
children have epilepsy because we that was
[SPEAKER_02]: an exclusion criteria in our in our group
but you can see they're all on different
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid regimens how did that happen
well we followed my rule it in or rule it
[SPEAKER_02]: out you start with one thing you titrate
up you look if there's any benefit what
[SPEAKER_02]: dose is that at can I do better than that
now often with most patients you hit a
[SPEAKER_02]: point at which you start to have side
effects and then we know that you're at
[SPEAKER_02]: the ceiling dose CBD can have a ceiling
for some patients I have patients that get
[SPEAKER_02]: GI upset if you go past a certain dose or
they get very sedated if you go past
[SPEAKER_02]: that's their ceiling dose we're going to
stay below that let's say that only helps
[SPEAKER_02]: them 75% but they're only 75% improved
well there's room for improvement then we
[SPEAKER_02]: add a second cannabinoid or we might try a
different product within the same category
[SPEAKER_02]: all of these patients were on cannabis for
at least a year and during that year was
[SPEAKER_02]: as or even if it was longer than that we
worked on ruling it in ruling it out
[SPEAKER_02]: dialing in on the products so always don't
ever think that just because somebody has
[SPEAKER_02]: one diagnosis this is what they should be
on in the cannabis world it really should
[SPEAKER_02]: be dialed in and certainly there's what's
happened now is that when I first started
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this it was really just THC on the
market and then around 2013 there was some
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD available and then we started to see
the other compounds come out now there's
[SPEAKER_02]: so many to choose from so it makes it a
little more difficult but pick one start
[SPEAKER_02]: there and then go through and that's why I
always say it is worthwhile if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with a significant medical
condition to have at least one
[SPEAKER_02]: consultation with a doctor nurse
practitioner somebody that knows about
[SPEAKER_02]: this that can at least give you the lay of
the land where does the research stand and
[SPEAKER_02]: what should I be looking at so just to get
some signaling on that all right my next
[SPEAKER_02]: is take care of your gut and you will have
a happy endocannabinoid system they are
[SPEAKER_02]: intimately related and is very important
you cannot say oh I'm using cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not helping me while you're eating a
cheeseburger and french fries from the
[SPEAKER_02]: greasiest place in town it's you have to
help your gut to move forward so that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can have a healthy endocannabinoid system
and so there's a article that came out
[SPEAKER_02]: last year that here's a quote the
endocannabinoid system encompasses a key
[SPEAKER_02]: interface between the gut microbiota the
immune system and homeostasis of the human
[SPEAKER_02]: host very important for your gut to be
part of this endocannabinoids and phyto
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids modulate gut inflammation the
microbiota stabilizing the blood-brain
[SPEAKER_02]: barrier pathway and reducing neuro
inflammation we think about inflammation
[SPEAKER_02]: we are kind of I once had a doctor
oncologist tell me that we live in a
[SPEAKER_02]: cesspool of chemicals right now by the
time you leave your house in the morning
[SPEAKER_02]: you've probably been exposed to 300
chemicals you might not be able to control
[SPEAKER_02]: some of that but you can control what you
put as my friend says in your pie hole so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's important to understand that you want
to take care of your gut and here's a just
[SPEAKER_02]: a nice graphic of this was a article that
looked at how HIV affects the immune
[SPEAKER_02]: system the gut and ultimately the brain
but as you can see what's at the center of
[SPEAKER_02]: all of it the endocannabinoid system and
if you're using cannabinoids and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not finding benefits think about taking
better care of your gut it's important
[SPEAKER_02]: because between those two things you can
often mitigate illness all right and then
[SPEAKER_02]: there's two very nice articles so dr.
Rousseau's beyond cannabis plants in the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system excellent talking
about this very thing and then also an
[SPEAKER_02]: article that's a little bit older but I
find it to be a really great article the
[SPEAKER_02]: care and feeding of the endocannabinoid
system so two very nice articles that are
[SPEAKER_02]: help you understand the interplay between
the various systems in your body and your
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system and then oh let me
go back one here so my number five and
[SPEAKER_02]: before I get on to the kids is respect
your receptors so I've been joking around
[SPEAKER_02]: about this for years respect your
receptors so what this slide shows I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know let's see is there a pointer I don't
know if you can see I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: working but anyway what you can see here
is the cell and on the cell wall are
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid receptors that you can see
they kind of look they're the like little
[SPEAKER_02]: neon yellow and then JWH 0108 is a
synthetic THC like compound so it binds to
[SPEAKER_02]: the type 1 receptor so what you can see on
there is that with this is showing acute
[SPEAKER_02]: administration in a cannabis naive rat if
you give them this compound all of the JWH
[SPEAKER_02]: goes ahead and sticks on to the
cannabinoid receptors and then what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens is with chronic use look what's
happening here so we went from a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of receptors on the cell wall to
just a few a lot of the compound ligand is
[SPEAKER_02]: still floating around looking for a place
to bind and if you'll notice the little
[SPEAKER_02]: neon cannabinoid receptors are now
internalized inside the cell and this
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from what this is the concept of
tolerance okay sometimes down regulating
[SPEAKER_02]: your receptors can be helpful but for the
most part if you want a good medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: effect you want to try to maintain a
decent amount of cannabinoid receptors
[SPEAKER_02]: that are not down regulated and so up in
the medical world I don't see too much
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerance but here and there I do
especially those patients who happen to be
[SPEAKER_02]: THC responders there are people out there
that do very well with THC I always try to
[SPEAKER_02]: include some CBD in there because it does
seem to help mitigate some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerance I always hate to do it what we
call it a tolerance break especially let's
[SPEAKER_02]: say in a child who's getting very good
results with either epilepsy or autism
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you take away their medicine
what happens is event they end up back at
[SPEAKER_02]: their baseline prior to cannabis use and
so parents will say to me oh there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: way I'm doing a tolerance break because I
can't do 48 hours of horrific behaviors
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've now lived three months
without that it's like it's causing them
[SPEAKER_02]: more trauma so what we do is we do try to
use other tools to changing chemo bars or
[SPEAKER_02]: adding in non THC cannabinoids to try to
help do some of the heavy lifting to try
[SPEAKER_02]: to help maintain the receptors and then
when I often talk with teenagers so we get
[SPEAKER_02]: teenagers that come in who as I said the
other day they know more than me about
[SPEAKER_02]: their endocannabinoid system so they just
think all THC all the time and what ends
[SPEAKER_02]: up happening I actually had a child who
ended up suicidal he was home I put him on
[SPEAKER_02]: I said you can use your vape pen to go to
sleep that's fine but you have to take
[SPEAKER_02]: your CBD in the morning he had terrible
anxiety depression and it had one suicide
[SPEAKER_02]: attempt years prior and was just reluctant
to take any more pharmaceuticals and he
[SPEAKER_02]: was okay with using CBD added in and after
about a month he decided I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: take the CBD anymore and he's a 17 year
old boy so good luck getting him to take
[SPEAKER_02]: it and the parents weren't really paying
attention and next phone call I got about
[SPEAKER_02]: a month later was he was being held on a
you know 51 50 hold for suicidal but what
[SPEAKER_02]: he had done was totally escalated his THC
use dabbing and whatnot that the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of that month so you know I feel very
strongly about this and I joke around for
[SPEAKER_02]: years that I was going to make a t-shirt
and there's your t-shirt respect your
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors people so okay let's get on with
the talk for children and I just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: point out this is one of my patients a
teenager with epilepsy and autism drew
[SPEAKER_02]: this picture to tell me just how much
cannabis impacted his life so how nice is
[SPEAKER_02]: that isn't a beautiful photo or a
beautiful picture that he drew so the most
[SPEAKER_02]: common conditions we see in pediatrics by
far intractable epilepsy and autism they
[SPEAKER_02]: often run together also cancer either for
side effects or to treat a child who has
[SPEAKER_02]: been given a very poor prognosis GI
disorders attention deficit and Tourette
[SPEAKER_02]: also anxiety depression chronic pain
genetic conditions and certainly end of
[SPEAKER_02]: life I'm going to focus on epilepsy and
autism that's where we have the most data
[SPEAKER_02]: a 2000 study done by quantum Brody showed
only 64% of epilepsy patients respond to
[SPEAKER_02]: medications and then they repeated the
study in 2018 to see since there were many
[SPEAKER_02]: new anti epileptic drugs on the market and
they found the same thing overall outcomes
[SPEAKER_02]: in newly diagnosed epilepsy have not
improved and more than one-third of
[SPEAKER_02]: patients experience epilepsy that remains
uncontrolled and this is where we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: think out of the box I have many patients
that are up for getting brain surgery or
[SPEAKER_02]: device implanted in their chest and I
always say why not try the benign plant
[SPEAKER_02]: first before you do anything invasive have
one child who has has had three brain
[SPEAKER_02]: surgeries and she was good for one week
after the brain surgery and then the sir
[SPEAKER_02]: seizures came back with a vengeance I'm
not sure how they go back two and three
[SPEAKER_02]: times because this is certainly not
reversible cannabis has been somewhat
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful for her condition this is just a
graph that I made looking at the number of
[SPEAKER_02]: publications if you just Google
cannabidiol and epilepsy or go to PubMed
[SPEAKER_02]: and you look at the research look at you
know kind of where it course correlates
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can see 2013 is when CNN aired the
weed documentary with dr. Sanjay Gupta and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was kind of that kind of opened the
floodgates a bit as he gave the stamp of
[SPEAKER_02]: mainstream approval there and as you can
see the scientific and medical community
[SPEAKER_02]: has responded with research so bravo to us
all of us who participated in that and now
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly clinical research supports the
use of CBD to treat refractory refractory
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepsy this is now considered to be a
very viable anti epileptic drug and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: just going to go through some of the
latest studies from the past couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: years that summarize what we have learned
over the last decade of watching and
[SPEAKER_02]: listening and researching CBD and other
cannabinoids for epilepsy so Gaston et al
[SPEAKER_02]: they used purified CBD in 89 children and
80 adults over two years and they saw a
[SPEAKER_02]: significant mean reduction in seizure
frequency at one month one year and two
[SPEAKER_02]: years all statistics highly statistically
significant and you can just see greater
[SPEAKER_02]: than 50% seizure reduction is considered
the clinical standard so you can see in
[SPEAKER_02]: children one month on CBD 46% and it goes
up after two years so if you have patients
[SPEAKER_02]: in the beginning that are saying well
we're not getting the best results hang in
[SPEAKER_02]: there look in adults it went from 31% to
52% and some of that also too is of course
[SPEAKER_02]: dosing titrating up slowly over time there
was a significant difference in seizure
[SPEAKER_02]: severity reduction at one year with adults
reporting greater improvement in seizure
[SPEAKER_02]: severity and that was highly significant
as well and here you can see just two
[SPEAKER_02]: charts the first chart is the percentage
change in seizure frequency and the you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see on the axis there the percentage
reduction from baseline so from zero and
[SPEAKER_02]: it drops how what how down so it's minus
60 but that's the percentage reduction and
[SPEAKER_02]: this is over time over two years and you
can see adults is the dashed line and
[SPEAKER_02]: pediatrics is the solid line and you can
certainly see that in the in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: seizure frequency it's almost equivalent
but in the second graph you can see that
[SPEAKER_02]: adult severity went down and that's
important because often these are people
[SPEAKER_02]: who have struggled with seizures their
whole life and have not had any good
[SPEAKER_02]: results okay how about EEG changes in
effect on sleep so CBD use decreased
[SPEAKER_02]: inter-ictal epileptic form discharges it's
a mouthful but this is basically evidence
[SPEAKER_02]: of a neuro excitatory brain that was
highly significant and then CBD use
[SPEAKER_02]: improved sleep microstructure and 84.6% of
those patients with abnormal sleep again a
[SPEAKER_02]: very high number here we have an
evaluation on cognitive and behavioral
[SPEAKER_02]: tests before and after CBD so this was
before and after just three months looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at patients 89% remained stable or showed
reliable improvement after three months on
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD very high percentage right cognitive
and behavioral changes were not
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly relate correlated to the CBD
dosing which is always very interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: improvements in short term and working
memory significantly related to better
[SPEAKER_02]: therapy response and there was no adverse
group-level effects on CBD reported in
[SPEAKER_02]: this study what about long term so there
was a signaling maybe around I want to say
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a study came out of Israel and a
few years ago that said maybe CBD effects
[SPEAKER_02]: wear off after three years and I would
tell you that here and there I saw
[SPEAKER_02]: patients who may be at the two or
three-year mark seem to maybe lose
[SPEAKER_02]: efficacy and remember in children they're
also growing and changing and hormones and
[SPEAKER_02]: so on so what is it is it the medicine
doesn't really work after three years well
[SPEAKER_02]: we have now this study published last year
CBD does not lose efficacy during
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment period up to five years most
patients in their group were able to at
[SPEAKER_02]: least decrease the dose of at least one
other pharmaceutical that they were using
[SPEAKER_02]: for epilepsy and certainly again here's
those words well-tolerated effective and
[SPEAKER_02]: safe for long-term use and so that
definitely gives those people out there
[SPEAKER_02]: who are still reluctant to think about CBD
as an anti epileptic it gives us the
[SPEAKER_02]: assurance and I'm just going to share with
you I so I trained at Children's Hospital
[SPEAKER_02]: right here in LA and I gave grand rounds
the month before a covert hit nobody from
[SPEAKER_02]: the neurology department would come to my
talk okay yeah they they boycotted my talk
[SPEAKER_02]: now it was standing room only but the
neurology department actually said to the
[SPEAKER_02]: head of the hospital how was how are you
how are you even justifying this this is
[SPEAKER_02]: what bothers me the literature is there
right the support is there so just be
[SPEAKER_02]: aware that we're still in that uphill
battle despite looking at all this
[SPEAKER_02]: research all right and here's one that
came out looking at an observational
[SPEAKER_02]: cohort study of epilepsy patients using
this is artisanal CBD so this is CBD from
[SPEAKER_02]: whole plant 280 patients using CBD and 138
who did not and compared to controls the
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD users had higher quality of life lower
psychiatric symptoms severity better sleep
[SPEAKER_02]: better medication tolerability improved
health outcomes longitudinally use of
[SPEAKER_02]: fewer prescriptions and reduced healthcare
utilization I think I'm beating a dead
[SPEAKER_02]: horse here right so I think we've we
figured out what's going on now dr. Russo
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned this the other day Pamplona's
study looking at CBD rich cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts over purified CBD and treatment
resistant epilepsy and this was a review
[SPEAKER_02]: of 11 sources with 670 patients pulled the
CBD dosing range was very wide once to 50
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram per kilo per day and that just
tells you about CBDs were very wide dosing
[SPEAKER_02]: if it doesn't work at a low dose go up and
the treatment length on the mean was six
[SPEAKER_02]: months 64 percent reported improvement in
frequency of seizures and there was more
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement with the CBD extracts 71
percent then with the purified CBD at 46
[SPEAKER_02]: percent this was statistically significant
but if you apply what's called the
[SPEAKER_02]: standard clinical threshold of greater
than 50 percent or more reduction of
[SPEAKER_02]: seizures there was no difference so then I
ask you well if there's no difference then
[SPEAKER_02]: what are we going to do how do you choose
go ahead and look CBD extract patients use
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly lower dose 6 milligram per
kilo per day versus the purified which is
[SPEAKER_02]: at 25 milligram per kilo per day and in
terms of the side effect profile the side
[SPEAKER_02]: effect profile for artisanal CBD was
significantly better than for purified CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: I find the only reason that I'm referring
patients now to get the purified CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: Epidiolex and it is only approved for
three conditions right now which is
[SPEAKER_02]: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome Dravet syndrome
and tuberous sclerosis but they will you
[SPEAKER_02]: can get it off label for other severe
epilepsies what I'm doing is when a
[SPEAKER_02]: patient needs a very high dose like we're
talking 1200 milligrams a day or 1600
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams a day and some of my big
teenagers that is a very difficult to
[SPEAKER_02]: afford so what we do is we will do some of
the dosing as Epidiolex that is they get
[SPEAKER_02]: help it's part of the insurance company
and the other part we do with the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: plant nobody ever said you can't mix them
so I do and it works out well so the
[SPEAKER_02]: parents don't have such a high financial
burden and so I initially wasn't too happy
[SPEAKER_02]: with Epidiolex because I don't like that
there's alcohol and some sucralose in it
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not great but at the same time if
it helps a family with the burden of
[SPEAKER_02]: paying for a high dose and keeps that
child off a multitude of other anti
[SPEAKER_02]: epileptics it certainly is the lesser evil
of Epidiolex versus other drugs so all
[SPEAKER_02]: right and now let's move on to drug drug
interactions this was a big concern when I
[SPEAKER_02]: first started doing this we really didn't
have any data so we were super super
[SPEAKER_02]: careful with patients this is a review of
six trials looking at the interactions
[SPEAKER_02]: between cannabidiol and enzyme inducers or
inhibitors and common anti-seizure drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD in this study was or review of these
six trials was not found to affect the
[SPEAKER_02]: CYP3A4 activity except for the case of a
drug called clobazam clobazam the brand
[SPEAKER_02]: name is Anfi it's a pretty potent
benzodiazepine it's a heavy-duty drug it
[SPEAKER_02]: causes a lot of sedation and slowing down
of a child's brain but it can be quite
[SPEAKER_02]: effective for seizures when you mix CBD
and clobazam CBD clobazam is like it is a
[SPEAKER_02]: drug in and of itself but it's also a pro
drug in that when you take it your liver
[SPEAKER_02]: converts clobazam to a secondary
metabolite called endosmethyl clobazam
[SPEAKER_02]: which is an anti convulsant in its own
right but endosmethyl clobazam is heavily
[SPEAKER_02]: sedating CBD seems to drive the liver to
convert more clobazam to its metabolite
[SPEAKER_02]: endosmethyl so you can't just give
somebody extra of that second drug the
[SPEAKER_02]: liver has to make that and so what happens
when they're taken together is there's an
[SPEAKER_02]: increased exposure to the major
metabolites of both compounds which can be
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial for the patient because now the
patient's getting more of that secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolite which is anti convulsant and if
they respond to that sometimes by adding
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD and boosting up that endosmethyl you
will see some improvement in seizures and
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't know whether it's the CBD or the
other or both sometimes you have to reduce
[SPEAKER_02]: the dosing of clobazam because as you
drive up that secondary metabolite the
[SPEAKER_02]: patients can get very sedated 40% of
patients in the Epidiolex trials require
[SPEAKER_02]: dialing back of their amphidos and so it
doesn't happen right away it's not like oh
[SPEAKER_02]: we up the dose of CBD and the next day the
child sedated it is when usually a week or
[SPEAKER_02]: two later CBD and valproate so this is
valproic acid or depakote there's been a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of talk about that because in the
Epidiolex trials they put in acute liver
[SPEAKER_02]: injury because they did see some elevation
of the test looking at liver function and
[SPEAKER_02]: liver enzymes but in this review it did
not cause clinically important changes in
[SPEAKER_02]: the pharmacokinetics of either I will tell
you that in my patient population depakote
[SPEAKER_02]: is very popular it being used by many
neurologists and those children usually
[SPEAKER_02]: get blood work every six months anyway I
have yet to see any issues I know in the
[SPEAKER_02]: article that Dustin and I co-authored with
Dr. Sanado out of Seattle Children's
[SPEAKER_02]: Hospital he's an neurologist he did not
see any changes in liver tests in children
[SPEAKER_02]: taking artisanal CBD and I just haven't
seen it it seems to be more so related to
[SPEAKER_02]: the Epidiolex I never say never I just
haven't seen it myself it only time I've
[SPEAKER_02]: actually ever seen elevated liver function
tests in patients taking very high dose
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD as in children who were also on liver
toxic chemotherapy so that combination can
[SPEAKER_02]: cause that elevation as well and so their
conclusion was quote these trials indicate
[SPEAKER_02]: an overall low potential for drug-drug
interactions between CBD and anti-seizure
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs except for club exam all right now
let's talk about Delta 9 THCA which I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to call just THCA from now on it was
first mentioned back in 1979 in a mouse
[SPEAKER_02]: model of seizures and it was
anti-convulsant at 200 milligram per kilo
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course there's many anecdotal
reports and I have many patients that take
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA is either other main anti-epilepsy
drug or as part of their regimen a study
[SPEAKER_02]: that came out this year used highly
purified THCA or a mixture of THCA and THC
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at mice that have what's called
Dravet syndrome which is a severe genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: pediatric epilepsy very very difficult to
treat these children have heat-induced
[SPEAKER_02]: seizures I once had a patient my air
conditioning in my office was out and the
[SPEAKER_02]: parents came walk came rolling into my you
know in the trials in a wheelchair say
[SPEAKER_02]: rolling in and they felt the temperature
in my office and said no way are we even
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting in this room because she will have
a seizure so there those kids are that
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive so the mixture was found to be
anti-convulsant in what's called the six
[SPEAKER_02]: hertz threshold this is for partial
epilepsy this kind of test in the mice and
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much on everything else it really
didn't appear to work it's always
[SPEAKER_02]: important to look at dosing and what does
purified mean does that mean there really
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't any THC in there or maybe there's
still a little bit because remember THCA
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to change to THC so it's very hard
to study it all by itself but certainly in
[SPEAKER_02]: my in in clinical practice THCA does help
a lot of my patients and because it it's
[SPEAKER_02]: either has a higher potency or because
it's more bioavailable at you can take a
[SPEAKER_02]: lower dose it's easier to get into the
body than CBD now looking at CBDA the
[SPEAKER_02]: first published report of its
anti-convulsant activity was actually in a
[SPEAKER_02]: patent back in 2019 looking at a mouse
model of generalized tonic clonic seizures
[SPEAKER_02]: we think the mechanism of action is
enhanced serotonin receptor activation
[SPEAKER_02]: which appears to be even better than with
CBD and then in this study which is again
[SPEAKER_02]: a mouse model of Dravet the CBDA brain
plasma ratio in an oil vehicle so this is
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD in just an oil extract which is
usually what's available on the market is
[SPEAKER_02]: this low ratio suggests poor brain
penetration but the question is is it
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting serotonin receptors in the gut
which is then talking to the brain but the
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDA they tried another vehicle which was
it which is something called tween 20
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a non ionic surfactant
emulsifying agent that's often used to
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilize oil and water extractions or
preparations the brain plasma ratio was
[SPEAKER_02]: much higher and in this with this product
they found it was anti-convulsant against
[SPEAKER_02]: the heat-induced seizures in this Dravet
model and then another study that came out
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the mouse what's called the MES
seizure this is for generalized tonic
[SPEAKER_02]: clonic seizures they compared three
different products so look at the first
[SPEAKER_02]: product that they labeled kylobinoid
that's what they called it so it's almost
[SPEAKER_02]: 75% CBDA and has other minor cannabinoids
and then they use magnesium as like this
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a binder to help penetrate through
the lipid layers and then they used a
[SPEAKER_02]: purified CBDA and I want to point out to
you that in the kylobinoid you see 75% and
[SPEAKER_02]: in the second one you see not almost 93%
so the second one is a higher potency
[SPEAKER_02]: right and then they compared it to
basically a CBD isolate and what they
[SPEAKER_02]: found was the kylobinoid was more
effective than the kind of pure CBDA in
[SPEAKER_02]: reducing seizures and this supports the
entourage effect because if you the lower
[SPEAKER_02]: potency but with the minor cannabinoids
seem to work better than the higher
[SPEAKER_02]: potency so that supports the idea that
when you have that whole plant that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can actually let all those compounds do
some of the heavy lifting for symptoms and
[SPEAKER_02]: then they also found that it was
comparable to CBD I have started using
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDA in my pediatric patients and I am
seeing some of these patients have good
[SPEAKER_02]: results not only for lowering seizure
frequency but also severity and duration
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as parents starting to report they
feel like their child has less anxiety and
[SPEAKER_02]: also sleeping better so again it's hard to
know when you're adding something into an
[SPEAKER_02]: already established regimen is it synergy
is it that compound again very hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: know but when we're going in the right
direction and by the way to I'm also
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing some good results in the kids who
have autism who don't have epilepsy with
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDA mostly the most common report is my
child's less anxious and so I'm finding
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've now kind of move CBDA up in the
list of what to try a little bit higher
[SPEAKER_02]: priority all right and then let's just
talk about THC for seizures everybody a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of neurologists are telling patients
OH THC causes seizures even a low dose and
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see that and we don't see
that being borne out by the research zone
[SPEAKER_02]: preclinical findings looking at six
species and 34 discrete animal models 21
[SPEAKER_02]: studies found anti convulsant effects one
study pro convulsant one mixed and 11
[SPEAKER_02]: studies didn't find any any effect on
seizures a report from 2016 was
[SPEAKER_02]: observational looking at 292 adult
patients 190 with epilepsy 64 with what's
[SPEAKER_02]: called psychogenic non epileptic seizures
and 26 with both these were patients who
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly inhaled about one gram a day 84% of
the patients using THC reported
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement in seizures it's a very high
number almost 73% of the ones with
[SPEAKER_02]: psychogenic non epileptic seizures
reported improvements and then here we
[SPEAKER_02]: have a study just from two years ago
looking at retrospective reports of using
[SPEAKER_02]: THC in patients with what I would call in
track severe intractable epilepsy so a 21
[SPEAKER_02]: year old with epileptic and this comes out
of Italy epileptic and encephalopathy
[SPEAKER_02]: since infancy the seizures went from 20 a
month to 7 a month with THC alone an 18
[SPEAKER_02]: year old with West syndrome with another
severe pediatric epilepsy since infancy
[SPEAKER_02]: reduction of seizures from 13 a day to 2 a
day and this last one is amazing here 25
[SPEAKER_02]: year old with juvenile absence epilepsy
and rare maybe twice a year generalized
[SPEAKER_02]: tonic chronic seizures went from 20
seizures a day to only four a month very
[SPEAKER_02]: impactful for that for that patient and
certainly for their family so we think the
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanism of action is decreases glutamate
via CB1 activation I'm sure there's other
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanisms but I find THC to be very
clinically helpful in my pediatric
[SPEAKER_02]: patients sometimes just adding a little
bit reduces seizures and also if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: weaning off anti epileptic drugs they're
going they're going to have withdrawal
[SPEAKER_02]: those drugs are very difficult to get off
of and I use low dose THC parents we
[SPEAKER_02]: usually put the kids on some regular
regimen maybe morning and night but I also
[SPEAKER_02]: tell the parents you can spot treat
anytime as needed treatment when you see
[SPEAKER_02]: your child having any difficulty and
remember you don't have to stay on that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's something just to get them through
the weaning and often parents seek
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits and say oh can we just make it
part of the regimen and so it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: easier for them to have it part of the
regimen day to day and then of course
[SPEAKER_02]: there is some tolerance that can occur if
it's the only medication that's being used
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a little boy I take care of that
has a multitude of medical issues and the
[SPEAKER_02]: only thing that's helped his seizures is
THC but he's on a very high dose we're
[SPEAKER_02]: still getting good control but I'm a
little afraid that we may lose the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal effect but we'll just have to
wait and see what happens now we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to switch to autism so the CDC now the
latest numbers one in 44 it was one in 54
[SPEAKER_02]: the last time I spoke in person so that's
a little disheartening boys are four times
[SPEAKER_02]: more likely to be diagnosed than girls
there are no approved medications to treat
[SPEAKER_02]: the core symptoms there are two FDA
approved medications that treat
[SPEAKER_02]: irritability they are and a typical
antipsychotics that have a lot of side
[SPEAKER_02]: effects also off-label medications like
stimulants anti-depressants anti-anxiety
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs are being used but often have low
efficacy and a risk of side effects new
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical studies show low efficacy
except for crossover there was one study
[SPEAKER_02]: reported in this report this year that
said all these other drugs aren't really
[SPEAKER_02]: working but the cannabinoid study shows
promise so that's always good to be
[SPEAKER_02]: included and then we know these patients
have more inflammation including neuro
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammation and gut issues so I'm going
to speed up a little bit because I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get to my research this is another graph
just to look at when did we start seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: publications on autism and cannabis and
it's not so long ago right 2019 is really
[SPEAKER_02]: when it took off just a few reports before
that so there's a lot of interest now and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's I think do one parents are going to
use it they don't have a lot of choices
[SPEAKER_02]: and again safe well tolerated efficacious
so let's look at this so we know that type
[SPEAKER_02]: 2 receptors are upregulated in children
with autism evidence of endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system dysfunction and then we have a
study from 2018 from Stanford that
[SPEAKER_02]: measured plasma nanomide levels not an
easy thing to do and they found that the
[SPEAKER_02]: nanomide endocannabinoid levels were
statistically significantly lower in
[SPEAKER_02]: children with autism to the point where
they could basically pick out the kids who
[SPEAKER_02]: had autism based on their blood work
without looking at the child and another
[SPEAKER_02]: report out of Israel lower circulating
endocannabinoid levels in children with
[SPEAKER_02]: autism spectrum so now we can see that
there is clearly some endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: dysfunction in these patients if you just
compare a few studies that came out
[SPEAKER_02]: between 2018 and 2019 these are just all
studies looking at children taking high
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD low THC preparations if you look there
20 to 1 mostly the very last one out of
[SPEAKER_02]: South America was 75 to 1 ratio in this
first study though they did add in THC if
[SPEAKER_02]: the patient did not have a good result
with just the high CBD and they found 52%
[SPEAKER_02]: improved on 20 to 1 and by adding in THC
another 33% so this idea of no THC for
[SPEAKER_02]: these patients remember they're low in
anandamide Dr. Meshulam taught teaches us
[SPEAKER_02]: over and over that anandamide and THC
mimic each other and why would you leave a
[SPEAKER_02]: child deficient so I'm really anti CBD
only laws because that really limits how
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving a lot of patients out who could
really benefit from cannabis medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I'm just going to go through if you
see in this first study 73% remained on
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment again satisfaction patient
satisfaction writer at least parental
[SPEAKER_02]: satisfaction overall improvements in 75%
82 plus percent remained in treatment in
[SPEAKER_02]: this study and then 77.7 remained on
treatment and if you go through side
[SPEAKER_02]: effects mild mild mild and again in a
study sometimes nobody's manipulating the
[SPEAKER_02]: medication to eliminate the side effect
but certainly we do that in clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: practice and now I just want to talk about
the last 15 minutes here talk about my
[SPEAKER_02]: research so I'm working with a group
called can from addicts and my two
[SPEAKER_02]: research partners are sitting here Dr.
it's a curic and can Epstein and they
[SPEAKER_02]: approached me actually at a can med
conference number of years ago and asking
[SPEAKER_02]: me to do research on what we call
pharmacometabolomics it's a mouthful as
[SPEAKER_02]: well looking at the impact of medical
cannabis on children who use medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to treat autism and we published
two papers one at the end of last year and
[SPEAKER_02]: one just a think a month or two ago
looking at what's called cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: responsive biomarkers that we collect in
saliva and so what are are these cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: responsive biomarkers and what is
pharmacometabolomics so basically what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing is you're just collecting
chemicals from the body and you can use
[SPEAKER_02]: urine you can use blood you can use tissue
you can we chose to use saliva and what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking at is this these compounds
called that make up what's called the
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolome which is a group of compounds
that allows us to see bio like the
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolites of the biochemical pathways so
one of the ways to look at this is that if
[SPEAKER_02]: you look at your DNA you can see what is
potential but these biomarkers tell you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually what is going on in that human
actual data as what their body is doing in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of the those pathways and so these
biomarkers allow a clinician to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: see where a patient is at baseline where
they are after treatment if you stop
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment what happens and it allows you
to see whether or not maybe there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: buildup of a certain chemical that's
causing toxicity it allows you to
[SPEAKER_02]: personalize treatment based on what we
call the collecting it before treatment
[SPEAKER_02]: and then following after and it gives you
numbers it gives you data not and I I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: the first person to argue what my the
parents tell me is the truth they are
[SPEAKER_02]: struggling and they are trying to find an
answer they do not lie especially with
[SPEAKER_02]: out-of-pocket costly medication when it's
not working I hear about it okay so don't
[SPEAKER_02]: I always people say oh it's wishful
thinking so they tell you that it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: better that is not true that is not my
experience I'm sure the clinicians in the
[SPEAKER_02]: audience can tell you and patients are not
it's not working they tell you but this
[SPEAKER_02]: actually gives us hard and fast objective
data and so this is not new there are
[SPEAKER_02]: numerous studies that are published
looking at metabolomics especially for
[SPEAKER_02]: autism and you can see here one that's
looking at blood and one looking at urine
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't know if if you tell a parent
of a child with autism that you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: have to go get blood work they will look
at you and say well you're gonna go with
[SPEAKER_02]: my child I'm not going because that can be
very very difficult these children have a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of fear people come at them with
needles and so on more so than just
[SPEAKER_02]: children without autism so it is nice to
be able to collect saliva at home very
[SPEAKER_02]: easy the parents can do it and so what we
did was he had 15 children with autism who
[SPEAKER_02]: were on medical cannabis treatment that
was deemed to be pretty successful pre
[SPEAKER_02]: meant we did a behavioral survey and
saliva collection before they got their
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis in the morning and you
can see on the right what we did was no
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis for at least eight hours
and no food or high sugar drinks and then
[SPEAKER_02]: we have them rinse their mouth to try to
minimize any noise in that in that saliva
[SPEAKER_02]: and then peak was the same thing a
behavior service survey done by the
[SPEAKER_02]: parents and then saliva collection 90
minutes after we had nine children
[SPEAKER_02]: typically developed who it gave us saliva
to establish what we call the physiologic
[SPEAKER_02]: range and we looked at what's called
cannabis responsive biomarkers that
[SPEAKER_02]: measure different pathways so chemicals
involved in neuronal dysfunction pain
[SPEAKER_02]: aggression and inflammation and again here
is what the patient population look like
[SPEAKER_02]: it was mostly boys when you look at dosage
times per day some kids took one dose in
[SPEAKER_02]: the morning some took two throughout the
day time to some took three edible or
[SPEAKER_02]: tincture edible just meant they were
putting all these kids run tincture that
[SPEAKER_02]: they were putting their medicine into food
and then swallowing it so and then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: see as I've shown you already the regimen
was very different for most of these kids
[SPEAKER_02]: now this is the behavior rating scales
before so this is in the morning before
[SPEAKER_02]: they get their medical cannabis dose and
so 11 children were rated severe one child
[SPEAKER_02]: moderate two children mild you can see red
is kind of the severe scores and so you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see that this chart and by the way so
along the top this is each child a one is
[SPEAKER_02]: this one of the six-year-old a two a three
a four and so on and and you can see what
[SPEAKER_02]: a heterogeneous group right so it's very
different from child to child now looking
[SPEAKER_02]: this is after they took their medical
cannabis and the behavior rating so you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see a lot more blue right what we saw
was 11 children improved two children had
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed response depending on the symptoms
being asked about and two kids had bad
[SPEAKER_02]: days they were just exhibited increased
difficulties on that day and who knows
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe asking them to give saliva threw
them off a little bit or you know they
[SPEAKER_02]: were just didn't get enough sleep the
night before it's hard to know but overall
[SPEAKER_02]: we have predominant that patients were
doing it that they improved now let's look
[SPEAKER_02]: at this real quick so this is our
typically developing group so you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: on the bottom one through nine those are
our patients that gave saliva and overall
[SPEAKER_02]: this is their biomarkers and you can see
they all kind of fall in within two
[SPEAKER_02]: standard deviations of each other right
there's not a lot of variance in the
[SPEAKER_02]: typically developing children and if you
go all the way to the right you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: the children with autism that the dark
blue that's where they fell for most of
[SPEAKER_02]: their biomarkers and then to the right is
after you see the peak that's after
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and so you can see that it
corrected and really what we say is it
[SPEAKER_02]: shifted towards the physiologic range
right established by those children
[SPEAKER_02]: without autism so here's one example so n
acetyl aspartic acid naa this is an
[SPEAKER_02]: abundant neurotransmitter and it reflects
neuro density and viability basically
[SPEAKER_02]: neuronal dysfunction and reading the
research you can have low levels in autism
[SPEAKER_02]: you can have high levels and high
functioning autism you really don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: it to be outside of that physiologic range
because that indicates some neuronal
[SPEAKER_02]: dysfunction and what we saw was two
distinct groups so if you look at the dark
[SPEAKER_02]: bars right the dark bars is they're either
very significantly elevated or kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: close to the typically developing but in
all cases the cannabis treatment modulated
[SPEAKER_02]: both groups towards the range the
physiologic range which suggests that the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis treatment is homeostatic if it's
low it's coming up and if it's high it's
[SPEAKER_02]: coming down it's stabilizing so it's very
fascinating you can see the in this
[SPEAKER_02]: graphed all the way to the right the those
are the that typically developing groups
[SPEAKER_02]: so you can compare and you can see the
differences with before and after so this
[SPEAKER_02]: is very exciting and this is nice to see
that it's not just anecdotal anymore
[SPEAKER_02]: that's very important and again this
preliminary study so I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: overstate but we were very excited with
these results and here's just another way
[SPEAKER_02]: of looking at it this is three of our
older kids so the arrow pointing down that
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of teal arrow pointing down
that's the physiologic mean and then minus
[SPEAKER_02]: two to plus two standard deviations which
all of the children and typically
[SPEAKER_02]: developing fell within and you can see
these are to the left is the list of
[SPEAKER_02]: biomarkers you can see all these
biomarkers are kind of off the charts on
[SPEAKER_02]: these kids right and then I really like
this slide because it really shows this is
[SPEAKER_02]: after medical cannabis this is amazing
right to see that their biomarkers shift
[SPEAKER_02]: and it correlated with the behavioral
survey so important all right and here's
[SPEAKER_02]: another one this comes from our second
paper looking at lipid based salivary
[SPEAKER_02]: biomarkers so we had a lot of biomarkers
to look at so we separated them and these
[SPEAKER_02]: are the lipid base these are compounds
that are inherently involved with the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system as well so here you
can see the patients are listed on the
[SPEAKER_02]: left a one through a 18 and you can see
the biomarker on the legend at the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: the various sphingosines I think is that
right and then again here you see after
[SPEAKER_02]: they take their medical cannabis so what
we saw was that medical cannabis optimized
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of these biomarkers in 94 percent
of patients so this is a tool to be used
[SPEAKER_02]: to help us personalize medicine finally
after 26 years of trial and error we may
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to start using this tool at some
point as we grow our database and then one
[SPEAKER_02]: last thing I want to show you is this
predictive and again early data but if you
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the first patient as so these are
all the biomarkers listed in gray and the
[SPEAKER_02]: first column which is mostly red that's
our patient one of our oldest patients a
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 year old and what you can see is all
those biomarkers are significantly out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the standard deviation and remember the
light blue is optimal the dark blue is
[SPEAKER_02]: like is bordering and then the red is way
out and so what you can see is that the
[SPEAKER_02]: likelihood of this patient pre so this is
at pre and what we determined was that
[SPEAKER_02]: this patient is 93 percent likely to
respond to cannabis this would be a very
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful tool to be able to determine who
to try cannabis in and who you may say you
[SPEAKER_02]: know what maybe you want to pursue another
treatment because remember it's
[SPEAKER_02]: time-consuming and it's costly and so this
is a very nice early result that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping that with more data collection that
we'll be able to really see if we can
[SPEAKER_02]: justify checking a patient beforehand to
see if there is some predictive value
[SPEAKER_02]: there these are our study limitations
small sample size doesn't reflect the
[SPEAKER_02]: heterogeneity of autism unable to
associate cannabinoid regimen with
[SPEAKER_02]: specific biomarker responses at this point
although there was some signaling now some
[SPEAKER_02]: patients the parents after you're on you
know cannabis for a while that parents
[SPEAKER_02]: know the dose so they kind of eyeball it
with the eyedropper and I'm usually like
[SPEAKER_02]: really a stickler for that using that one
ml syringe so they're measuring it
[SPEAKER_02]: properly but it may have not been an
accurate reflection of the dose and then
[SPEAKER_02]: in this study we gave equal impact to all
the biomarkers because at this point we're
[SPEAKER_02]: still trying to sort out which ones are
really important in this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: population of patients and that's it thank
you very much
[SPEAKER_02]: do you have a question dr. Beerman yeah
this
[SPEAKER_06]: is epilepsy right by the way you did a
great job on that expert witness thing is
[SPEAKER_06]: the I have some patients that just get THC
and a lot of improvement I'm thinking of
[SPEAKER_06]: two particular ones one was a
nine-year-old girl she got 10 milligrams
[SPEAKER_06]: the parents and the teachers said she had
a 30% improvement in one week and the
[SPEAKER_06]: other one was the grandson of a physician
and he required 30 milligrams of THC twice
[SPEAKER_06]: a day and he lived in a residential living
facility and when he ran out once they
[SPEAKER_06]: called me up and said hey hey it was in it
was in a candy bar so we will you rewrite
[SPEAKER_06]: it I did so I guess I put in a good word
for THC and I want to know what what you
[SPEAKER_06]: think about it because these studies are
all based on different doses and you know
[SPEAKER_06]: we don't know what actually causes some of
these things and that's it thank you dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beerman so I agree with you THC is an
incredible compound and we can no longer
[SPEAKER_02]: live in this world that tried to make it
CBD good and THC bad no absolutely not THC
[SPEAKER_02]: can do what CBD cannot sometimes a lot of
the parents that I see look I could tell
[SPEAKER_02]: it I can I hate to say this but I can pick
out a cop and an attorney really easily I
[SPEAKER_02]: worked in the pediatric ER for a really
long time you start to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: personalities you know within about five
minutes of walking into the room I've had
[SPEAKER_02]: fathers who come in you know they come in
for the first consultation with their
[SPEAKER_02]: child having horrific seizures and when I
bring up THC there's this what what like
[SPEAKER_02]: what are you doing and I'm like oh you're
a law enforcement I can tell right away
[SPEAKER_02]: they truly have this it's been drilled
into them right THC is useful TH I always
[SPEAKER_02]: try to include THC the problem with THC
right now believe it or not my patients
[SPEAKER_02]: are having a harder time accessing good
quality low potency THC tinctures than
[SPEAKER_02]: before legalization yeah right what
happened to all the good THC tinctures in
[SPEAKER_02]: California right they kind of disappeared
there's like three companies that where
[SPEAKER_02]: you can measure one milligram two
milligrams three milligrams there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: great product on the market it's 75
milligrams per one ml how do I dose that
[SPEAKER_02]: point one ml is seven point five
milligrams I don't want to start with that
[SPEAKER_02]: dose in a three-year-old right so I love
THC I'm very upset that it's starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: become difficult to access for my patients
because again dosing is key I these
[SPEAKER_02]: patients are that I take care of they are
very complex and it can be the difference
[SPEAKER_02]: of like point zero five mls on a syringe
the difference between having a good day
[SPEAKER_02]: and having a bad day so we want to be able
to measure the THC and know the dosing and
[SPEAKER_05]: keep up with that especially as they grow
hi Bonnie it's Ethan great job you'd
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned a problem with sucralose in
Epidiolex was that related to its
[SPEAKER_05]: interference with the gut microbiome yes
that's exactly what parents are concerned
[SPEAKER_02]: about because you know they'll go and read
all the ingredients you have to remember a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of these patients are kids that have
multi a multitude of issues like
[SPEAKER_02]: mitochondrial disorders I have a patient
who literally the mom tries one drop in
[SPEAKER_02]: the mouth and he's had bad reaction to one
drop this is a child with what's called
[SPEAKER_02]: pans or pandas he has mitochondrial
disorder is autism and epilepsy and a
[SPEAKER_02]: multitude of other issues they hear
sucralose they go running in the other
[SPEAKER_02]: direction that's what it is and they're
worried about the gut and they're worried
[SPEAKER_02]: about the liver because when you read
about sucralose it's not exactly a liver
[SPEAKER_05]: friendly right and then not just a comment
see what you think you know I was really
[SPEAKER_05]: struck by the color study that pointed out
that THC a required an anticonvulsant dose
[SPEAKER_05]: of 200 milligrams per kilogram per day and
you using nothing like that you know it
[SPEAKER_05]: really appears that the ramp model is no
good rodents barely have a cerebral cortex
[SPEAKER_05]: THC a does not appear to cross the
blood-brain barrier when it's intact but
[SPEAKER_05]: in severe epilepsy it's not intact and
that's why I think it works at these lower
[SPEAKER_05]: doses does that make sense to you I agree
I think these patients that have excessive
[SPEAKER_02]: neuro inflammation probably have a
compromised blood-brain barrier I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know how we're going to prove that I think
the only way that we would be able to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that is to join up with a neurosurgeon who
is doing surgery on either pediatric or
[SPEAKER_02]: adult patients who where they go in and
they remove the you know the loci or the
[SPEAKER_02]: focus of where the seizures are coming
from after the brain mapping is done and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe we can try to get to look at some of
the blood-brain barrier and see if we can
[SPEAKER_02]: find out if it's compromised I don't know
of any other way to do it in humans sure
[SPEAKER_07]: thank you thank you for your patience with
autism who you said reported about a 75%
[SPEAKER_07]: improvement what sorts of clinical
outcomes were you were you looking at a
[SPEAKER_02]: great question so we look at aggression we
look at self-injurious behavior we look at
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to transition from one activity to
another that's a big thing you know I've
[SPEAKER_02]: had parents who tell me they're kids are
getting thrown out of school because they
[SPEAKER_02]: the child can't go from one activity to
another and throws a chair at the teacher
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to move from one activity to
another sleep and then one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: ones is anxiety kids with autism suffer
suffer some terrible anxiety it's just I
[SPEAKER_02]: call them Ferraris going down the freeway
at the with you know what is that pedal to
[SPEAKER_02]: the metal and remember a lot of the drugs
that we're using for these patients just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of put them part we don't want that
we just want them to go speed limit right
[SPEAKER_02]: we want them to be able to function and
integrate into a classroom and learn and
[SPEAKER_02]: basically what we want is them to reach
their potential and a lot of these kids
[SPEAKER_02]: are written off they're nonverbal and
maybe they're not following directions or
[SPEAKER_02]: they're super anxious and people write
them off as you know intellectually
[SPEAKER_02]: disabled and the vast majority of my
patients are not intellectually disabled
[SPEAKER_02]: they can get the work done they can learn
I have a patient right now who's 11 years
[SPEAKER_02]: old who has the vocabulary of a PhD
student I mean he's a amazing when he
[SPEAKER_02]: types but he gets no credit for anything
because he has all of this other stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that it when people see it they just go oh
yeah you know he's not even worth the time
[SPEAKER_02]: a day and he has done incredibly well on
cannabis so he was a child who actually
[SPEAKER_02]: had such severe self-injurious behavior he
broke his own arm and I mean this is what
[SPEAKER_02]: people are dealing with and so when we
look at these behaviors you're basically
[SPEAKER_02]: scaling irritability and aggression and
anxiety and so on does that answer your
[SPEAKER_07]: question it does thank you and I have a
second question if I can sure when you
[SPEAKER_07]: integrate the how do you integrate the
medical cannabis regimen when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: already on other medications when they're
on their medication yeah so I leave
[SPEAKER_02]: medication alone for the most part and I
start with the cannabis and I just say
[SPEAKER_02]: we're just gonna I know you're anxious to
wean it but let's just leave it alone
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you start weaning and you're
adding cannabinoids and something goes
[SPEAKER_02]: south you don't know what's what so my
general rule of thumb is one change at a
[SPEAKER_02]: time occasionally I break that rule but
what I'll do is I'll usually just based on
[SPEAKER_02]: the patient's symptoms if they're very
aggressive or self-injurious or not
[SPEAKER_02]: sleeping at night I will lean more towards
like a CBD THC low ratio if it's a child
[SPEAKER_02]: who's not having a lot of that aggression
or self-injurious or is still is sleeping
[SPEAKER_02]: okay I'll lean towards more of a high CBD
low THC because about half the kids will
[SPEAKER_02]: respond with that and I was gonna say I
was gonna say this with dr. Beerman asked
[SPEAKER_02]: me about THC my point about saying there's
not a lot of THC preparations out there
[SPEAKER_02]: that are useful now for pediatrics there's
some I have parents like waiting for a
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary to call them that they got the
product in and there's people here who
[SPEAKER_02]: live on that side where I text them and
say are you gonna get this in because
[SPEAKER_02]: these people ran out and they're using
something else and the kid lost a week of
[SPEAKER_02]: his life because he couldn't go to school
because all his behaviors came back
[SPEAKER_02]: because he doesn't have the proper
medicine CBD from the hemp world if you
[SPEAKER_02]: know you look at the COAs and you follow
companies for a while there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: good CBD out there and the parents can
order it online or go pick it up at the
[SPEAKER_02]: local health food store and it just makes
it so much easier and in California
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not paying that crazy high state
tax along with the other taxes that go
[SPEAKER_02]: with it so as much as I can I do try to
incorporate products that are from the
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp market because it's just easier for
the families right but if something needs
[SPEAKER_02]: to come from the dispensary so that's THC
THCA and any of the low ratios it makes it
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more difficult for families but
basically I just try to go through each
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid and I we didn't really talk
about this but CBG is a very helpful
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid in autism it's
anti-inflammatory I have patients who have
[SPEAKER_02]: become verbal on it I see focus with CBG
and again what are the mechanisms you know
[SPEAKER_02]: we heard some lectures today about CBG
certainly a wonderful cannabinoid easily
[SPEAKER_02]: accessed by parents as well right on the
hemp market you can I I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can get it in a dispenser I don't think so
so the whole idea behind the regimen takes
[SPEAKER_02]: into all these factors right it's just not
one size fits all I try to start with what
[SPEAKER_02]: the patient's needs are where the family
lives their access their lifestyle do they
[SPEAKER_02]: travel a lot because again you're not
going to be traveling all over the world
[SPEAKER_02]: with THC because that might get
confiscated and then you're stuck
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere without it so there's a lot of
things that go into how you create a
[SPEAKER_02]: regimen for a patient but it is basically
rule it in or rule it out if something
[SPEAKER_02]: works we keep it and then we move on to
the next I usually don't mean drugs for at
[SPEAKER_02]: least I'd like to see a few months of
stability and when you get that
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement parents always say how am I
gonna know I'm like you know you know your
[SPEAKER_02]: child right so we all know our loved ones
we know when they're having a good day and
[SPEAKER_02]: a bad day and so if you watch over time
after a few months and the child's doing
[SPEAKER_02]: well you can start to wean don't be
surprised if you have to give more THC
[SPEAKER_02]: while you're weaning a drug or more CBD
because sometimes it is doing a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: for the patient or just removing it you
have to start you know it throws them out
[SPEAKER_02]: of balance and you have to get back into
balance thank you very much you're welcome
[SPEAKER_01]: hi Marley Colt I'm from Utah but I asked
you a question yesterday and I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: your answer was just phenomenal and I
think everyone could benefit from it so
[SPEAKER_01]: your opinion on medical cannabis
inhalation for children and how young they
[SPEAKER_01]: can inhale for acute symptoms obviously we
don't want them smoking a joint or a bong
[SPEAKER_01]: or something but still would you prefer
them try vape cartridges and or a dry herb
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizer yeah just elaborate on that so
my experience with vaping and children is
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty extensive so I have a handful of
pediatric epilepsy teenagers who get auras
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the sensation that a seizure is
coming and if they vape THC or a
[SPEAKER_02]: one-to-one CBD THC it stops the seizure
from happening and that has I've seen it
[SPEAKER_02]: over and over in certain patients so I
have no problem with them using and
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizer and either it there's a I don't
want to endorse a company here but there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a company here that if you take a puff the
device vibrates kind of like your phone
[SPEAKER_02]: vibrates and that's like about two and a
half milligrams depending on the makeup
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of parents like that because
they know okay it's kind of close to dose
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a dose right they're not just not
sucking on the thing and then I do have
[SPEAKER_02]: some patients who have rage with autism
they're aware of their rage they know that
[SPEAKER_02]: they get into this you know kind of
escalated they feel that anxiety and they
[SPEAKER_02]: will ask for a take a puff they will go to
their parent and they either use a flower
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizer with flower or they'll use one
of these other vape cartridge devices I
[SPEAKER_02]: have not seen any issues in these patients
using inhaled for basically rescue think
[SPEAKER_02]: about right we're rescuing its rescue
medicine so this is not unusual in
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepsy there's nasal rescue medication
there's rectal valium there's all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: rescue medicine out there so certainly
there's no reason that we can't use this
[SPEAKER_02]: and it is quite successful now when you
ask me the age I don't think I've ever had
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody under eight use a vaporizer I'm
not sure Dustin have you had any patients
[SPEAKER_02]: younger than eight no yeah so I you know
they have to be able to do it now I do
[SPEAKER_02]: have a family and I showed them on Tuesday
this brother sister so the brother has
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepsy autism cyclical vomiting syndrome
and a genetic abnormalities done
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly well he's in my book his name
is Gavin and when he gets a cyclical a
[SPEAKER_02]: cyclical vomiting episode the parents have
a volcano vaporizer they have homegrown
[SPEAKER_02]: grant what is that granddaddy purple and
they put him in the bathroom and they ramp
[SPEAKER_02]: up their volcano this has he's been able
to avoid emergency room I mean they were
[SPEAKER_02]: at the ER every month for the longest time
and he's on high dose CBD and THC whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: it is that triggers him when it goes it
goes and so this has really helped his
[SPEAKER_02]: sister when she got COVID had a seizure
first seizure in four years and she caught
[SPEAKER_02]: it at school even with the mask on and she
had her seizure and she seemed like she
[SPEAKER_02]: was gonna cluster a little bit so I said
go ahead and just use the volcano on her
[SPEAKER_02]: and she recovered she didn't have any
further seizures no clusters no nothing I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean it works now they both don't like it
they scream bloody murder and that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: they go in the bathroom because they don't
want the neighbors calling the cops that
[SPEAKER_02]: the kids are getting but they don't like
the device of you know and so what they
[SPEAKER_02]: did was they took the volcano and they
kind of rigged up a little pediatric
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen mask to it and there's a video
online that you can see a patient in Texas
[SPEAKER_02]: who's very well known a young lady with
severe autism is very self-injurious and
[SPEAKER_02]: her parents have the volcano always ready
to go and they just kind of got some
[SPEAKER_02]: tubing they got a pediatric mask and they
give her the vape and you see her very
[SPEAKER_02]: unhappy to very happy very quickly so I
think it's something that we cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: disregard it's something that should be
included in many of these pediatric cases
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah thanks a lot for the presentation I
just want to we might terrifying your
[SPEAKER_04]: comment regarding the effects of CBD on
the patient microbiome because I sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: hear you were saying something regarding
the susceptibility of the patient due to
[SPEAKER_04]: mitochondria so that I would just you know
keywords I'm sorry I don't understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: question the question like what does CBD
do to the microbiome yeah well by enhance
[SPEAKER_02]: so remember CBD enhances your end I mean
CBD has a tons of targets in your body in
[SPEAKER_04]: autism patient in autism patient and then
the first part and the second part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: question is we have a panel earlier today
that talk about how regulation in
[SPEAKER_04]: different state in the in this country now
right now there is no different in in guy
[SPEAKER_04]: nine you know across this country for
microbial contaminant testing for
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational and medical cannabis I was
just wondering if you have any insight you
[SPEAKER_04]: know moving forward should there be a
different guy nine for medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: and recreational cannabis thank you right
well that's a good question I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm the right person to ask to answer
that second question I would say I will
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you that so far I haven't had anybody
get sick even in the unregulated market
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're always very careful with
pediatric patients we never really use a
[SPEAKER_02]: product unless the parents doing it like
went rogue and is doing it on their own
[SPEAKER_02]: for me it's a deal-breaker if I don't have
a COA that's it so I have a COA so I can
[SPEAKER_02]: always see what the patient is on and we
can also look at batch to batch to see if
[SPEAKER_02]: there's any change you know early on back
in 2008 or I should say I really 2013 I
[SPEAKER_02]: had patients that would start with one
product and get great results and go right
[SPEAKER_02]: back to the same company or the same
cultivator processor and get the oil
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly labeled exactly the same thing
they say oh my child's not responding
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore and say it's not the same but it's
different it's a different chemo bar dip
[SPEAKER_02]: that was made different we don't even know
what's in there we have to get a COA and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's when I started looking at COA's was
very early on when my patients were
[SPEAKER_02]: getting very inconsistent results in terms
of the microbiome I that's like a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: lecture and I would refer you to Ethan
Russo's paper and also to the care and
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding but basically remember CBD
enhances your endocrine endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system by allowing anandamide to hang
around a little longer it blocks the
[SPEAKER_02]: breakdown of anandamide or encourages that
pathway and so by establishing an enhanced
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system and that's a whole
idea behind cannabis is that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: augmenting the endocannabinoid system to
get it back into balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi so about ten years ago I was having all
these IBS symptoms and so I started
[SPEAKER_00]: reading about people juicing and so I
decided I would juice and this was before
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going into the office and I figured
oh it's THCA I'll be I'll be fine because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was fresh material and I ended up
getting really stoned and I was like what
[SPEAKER_00]: the hell is happening I figured oh there
must be some decarboxylated material in
[SPEAKER_00]: here and so I tried it again I got stoned
again and anyway it led me to question
[SPEAKER_00]: whether in people with certain acidic
stomach conditions whether there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA essentially decarboxylating in the
gut and Ethan's question about you know
[SPEAKER_00]: why THCA appears to maybe be effective and
you know the hypothesis that maybe it has
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with the blood brain barrier you
know having a break a breakdown in these
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of patients I think we might also
look at variability in terms of pH levels
[SPEAKER_00]: in the gut of these patients because
obviously we know that pH is associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with microbiomes etc so I'm wondering if
you've if you've seen anybody take THCA
[SPEAKER_00]: and get high and second whether you think
that that might be a good hypothesis for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody to pursue now that I'm not in the
cannabis game I'd love to see somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: pursue that research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I think it's already been done and I
think that we've discounted that it does
[SPEAKER_02]: not appear that THCA converts to THC in
the body and nor does CBDA convert to CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: in the body so that those I could look up
those references and share that with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of getting high on THCA sure I've
had patients get high on what's reported
[SPEAKER_02]: to be THCA because remember by the time my
patients get it they're usually not using
[SPEAKER_02]: whole plant or raw or plant material it's
usually been processed somewhere along the
[SPEAKER_02]: line and depends on how long it was
sitting on a shelf what the was it kept in
[SPEAKER_02]: a refrigerator did it get exposed like was
it sitting in a truck where it sat outside
[SPEAKER_02]: a distribution center in the hot Southern
California weather so it's hard to know
[SPEAKER_02]: because there will be conversion in that
bottle there's always some THCA I'm sorry
[SPEAKER_02]: THC in a bottle of THC we just don't know
how much now there's one product that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been using with my patients it's like a 20
to one THCA to THC but there's also
[SPEAKER_02]: products out there that have THCA and CBD
there's products out there that have THCA
[SPEAKER_02]: one to one with THC so we have to read
labels you have to know what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting and I highly recommend keeping it
in a refrigerator if it's not in a dark
[SPEAKER_02]: bottle put it in a dark bottle or wrap it
in tin foil because every time you open
[SPEAKER_02]: and close the refrigerator there's some
light getting in so in order to maintain
[SPEAKER_02]: it as close to it's like when you
purchased it but again before buying it in
[SPEAKER_02]: a dispenser you have no idea what happened
to it so it certainly could contain a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of THC and that's why I always tell
patients to always start with a low dose
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why you became so intoxicated
maybe you're maybe Dustin has a you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick answer Dustin yeah I suppose it
could have been cavitation from from
[SPEAKER_00]: juicing I you know I was lucky enough to
have access to a mass spec and so I took
[SPEAKER_00]: what I had and I looked at it and it was
THC a so I think that the and I'm familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with the data that you're talking about I
don't think that that data at all
[SPEAKER_00]: accounted for people with gut conditions
specifically yeah there's probably some
[SPEAKER_00]: variability sure yeah so I think that
there's potentially a pH issue happening
[SPEAKER_00]: because when I tried the THC a when I
wasn't in an acute you know episode I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't get me high yeah that's interesting
yeah and and I tell people like I have
[SPEAKER_02]: parents and sales this is gonna make my
child higher to gonna make them agitated
[SPEAKER_02]: is gonna make them calm I say all bets are
off don't guess just try it and see
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's very hard to guess with
cannabis right it's a it's poly
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical to start with right too
many colors lots and lots of compounds we
[SPEAKER_02]: want them all in there but you just don't
know which person's gonna be sensitive to
[SPEAKER_02]: what and then you know last night
listening to daddy speak you know he found
[SPEAKER_02]: these go to sleep one and go to sleep to
we're not even accounting for all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds that we have no idea right and
that and but I really believe again the
[SPEAKER_02]: the information we have at this time is
that cannabis is safe it's well tolerated
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't really have any qualms about
treating pediatric patients with it
[SPEAKER_02]: especially under medical supervision
because really things don't go south too
[SPEAKER_09]: often so thank you for your question
excuse me thank you Bonnie for all your
[SPEAKER_09]: work with pediatrics you and I share that
field but I had a question a twofold with
[SPEAKER_09]: the biomarkers that you saw is you think
that might help with early detection of
[SPEAKER_09]: autistic children and also we look at
maybe dosing these children early on very
[SPEAKER_09]: early ages and where we slow down the
progression of autism or at least help
[SPEAKER_02]: with development yeah great questions
thank you so yes I do think that these can
[SPEAKER_02]: be used as biomarkers once we have more
data and we're able to really see which
[SPEAKER_02]: ones are very highly elevated and are
consistently elevated across member it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum disorder so we want to be able to
have the best idea of which biomarkers
[SPEAKER_02]: correlate the best I absolutely think that
would be great and I mentioned this the
[SPEAKER_02]: other day that you might be able to use
plasma nanomide levels as a bio as a
[SPEAKER_02]: biomarker for autism as well so there are
a number of things that we can look at
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe we do a nanomide and biomarkers and
we see if there's some correlation there
[SPEAKER_02]: as well I'm sorry what was your second
question oh right yeah I do think starting
[SPEAKER_02]: them earlier would be helpful and someone
might say how early I mean the youngest
[SPEAKER_02]: patient I've ever treated was a
six-week-old with a severe genetic seizure
[SPEAKER_02]: disorder that was likely having seizures
in utero I couldn't treat them until I
[SPEAKER_02]: have the diagnosis at six weeks is when
the genetics came back and we started
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment and that child did fairly well
it was a devastating metabolic syndrome so
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how good we're gonna be able
to get that child I certainly wasn't gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: wait and let him continue to have he was
having hundreds of seizures on his EEG a
[SPEAKER_02]: day and you know and then what are you
gonna are you gonna give a six month old a
[SPEAKER_02]: multitude of anti epileptic drugs I mean
right do no harm so he did okay I mean he
[SPEAKER_02]: had much less seizures we never got him
seizure-free and it's not it the this
[SPEAKER_02]: group of patients that have refractory
epilepsy look I have had patients that
[SPEAKER_02]: have tried up to 22 different anti
epileptics you're talking about a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time to try these you're losing brain
cells as you go to me if you're really
[SPEAKER_02]: hardcore and want to try one or two go
right out of the gate but I do always
[SPEAKER_02]: think that it's worth the conversation in
the beginning why not use the benign plant
[SPEAKER_02]: now that we have so much data why not try
it what if your child is the child that's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna respond and you don't have to go
down that pathway of those hardcore drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: that do cause a lot of somnolence and all
other kinds of side effects hi well thank
[SPEAKER_03]: you for all your work first of all my
question was regarding the marker for your
[SPEAKER_03]: research study on about sleep how do you
guys measure the sleep efficiency you know
[SPEAKER_02]: this was that a study that I quoted for
sleep I believe you ask actually you know
[SPEAKER_03]: you answer the question about the markers
and one of your markers for your research
[SPEAKER_02]: study was asleep for the improvement
remember which one needs talk to you have
[SPEAKER_02]: it what did we have a biomarker for sleep
no I think it was inflammation pain
[SPEAKER_03]: neuronal dysfunction okay sorry I thought
you mentioned asleep so I was just
[SPEAKER_03]: wondering if it was poly sonography or it
was actually sleep diaries that's a good
[SPEAKER_02]: question I I did mention sleep in one of
the EEG reports and what they did was they
[SPEAKER_02]: had the children were or the patients in
that report did wear the EEG suit through
[SPEAKER_02]: sleep and so they did have brainwaves
looking at the quality of the sleep and
[SPEAKER_02]: what they call the microstructure and it
was like something over 75% of those
[SPEAKER_02]: patients had improvement in their sleep
microstructure microstructure based on an
[SPEAKER_03]: EEG okay okay was that just a portable
unit probably right yes I'm not sure where
[SPEAKER_08]: they did that yeah hi again thank you
amazing work the gut microbiome being so
[SPEAKER_08]: important are any of these kids following
a special diet like a low carb vegetable
[SPEAKER_02]: rich diet or is that just impossible no
it's not impossible it's you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: hard when you have a special needs child
to then also control everything that goes
[SPEAKER_02]: into their mouth especially when they are
super super super picky yeah and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: problems with textures and so on some of
my patients are gluten-free dairy-free
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar-free and some are the exact opposite
and come in my office with the ring of
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheetos around their mouth and I try not
to look because that's not even real food
[SPEAKER_02]: but I always tell parents to try dietary I
always encourage it just give it three
[SPEAKER_02]: months of gluten-free it's a lot easier to
do gluten-free now than it ever was
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's so many gluten-free
options even here there's gluten-free and
[SPEAKER_02]: you go out to dinner they mark on the you
know on a menu but many people are
[SPEAKER_02]: reluctant to do it and I think part of
that is they don't want to do gluten-free
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't want to have to prepare a
meal for their child that is special and
[SPEAKER_02]: then everybody else is eating something
different yeah that won't work either so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a challenge it's a great question and
some people do it hardcore and other
[SPEAKER_02]: people when I mentioned it just say that's
last resort so do you find that the ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that are doing it get better results it's
a good question I would say that the ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that stick to it are sticking to it for a
reason because they see and remember too
[SPEAKER_02]: that once your child's old enough you
don't have control over what they eat
[SPEAKER_02]: right they go to a birthday party or they
go to a you know they're in high school
[SPEAKER_02]: and so again that so it's a very hard
thing more so in the pediatric autism I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry epilepsy group is the ketogenic diet
yeah yeah but that is a parents will do
[SPEAKER_02]: that at all costs because when you live
with intractable seizures if just changing
[SPEAKER_02]: tweaking the diet and you usually for
ketogenic diet they have a dietitian as
[SPEAKER_02]: part of their neurology appointment and
they just get so much assistance for that
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see as many parents seeking that
kind of nutritional assistance with
[SPEAKER_02]: children with autism although you could
I'm sure that you could see a nutritionist
[SPEAKER_02]: or a dietitian to help you with that but
it's a great question I think it's a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: picture right you know how for autism one
of their their little logo is the puzzle
[SPEAKER_02]: piece yeah that's what it is yeah cannabis
is just another puzzle piece and so is the
[SPEAKER_02]: diet cool thank you thank you any other
questions thank you very much everybody
