[SPEAKER_00]: to discuss all things related to cannabis
from the bench to the bedside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're calling it the CanMed Community
Board, and it's a great way to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: and collaborate with experts and
enthusiasts in cannabis science,
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, cultivation, and testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the link in the show description
to join today or just search CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: Community on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we discuss dosing medical
cannabis with Dr. Dustin Sulak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dustin is an osteopathic general
practitioner who focuses on treating
[SPEAKER_00]: patients with refractory conditions using
an individualized health centered
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sulak is a founder of Integrate
Health, a medical practice in Maine that
[SPEAKER_00]: follows over 8,000 patients using medical
cannabis and co-founder of Healer.com,
[SPEAKER_00]: a medical cannabis education resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dustin has also participated in every
CanMed event since our first event in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: He serves on our CanMed advisory board,
evaluating abstracts and helping select
[SPEAKER_00]: presenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is an instructor on our full day
CanMed medical practicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topics we discussed include why dosing
medical cannabis is different from other
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutics, the fact that cannabinoids
can have a biphasic and even triphasic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, how a patient's optimal dose can
change over time, commonly going down,
[SPEAKER_00]: how patients commonly build a tolerance to
the adverse effects of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not the benefits, the benefits of
working with a trained medical provider to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine one's optimal dose, but also
strategies for how patients can find their
[SPEAKER_00]: own, how cannabis can be used for health
promotion and disease prevention,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how using a variety of cannabis
cultivars and not sticking to just one
[SPEAKER_00]: strain can actually be a benefit for
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Dustin, I would like to thank this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's sponsor Cannabis Patient Care
Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Patient Care Magazine is an
educational resource for patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical professionals, caregivers,
and advocates on the latest research,
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, and treatment options medical
cannabis provides for a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are excited to announce that their
March issue will be coming out next week
[SPEAKER_00]: with a focus on chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue features content from industry
thought leaders in medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Brendan McKernan, CEO of
Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eloise Thiessen, Board Certified Adult
Geriatric Nurse Practitioner, President of
[SPEAKER_00]: the American Cannabis Nurses Association,
and a medical leader of this year's Can
[SPEAKER_00]: Men Medical Practicum, and others.

[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, our friends at the hemp and
coffee exchange are creating some great
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't know, hemp coffee is
healthy, delicious, and a natural product
[SPEAKER_00]: rich in traceants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains trace minerals and nutrients,
providing sustained energy without the
[SPEAKER_00]: crash of regular coffee.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dustin Sulak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Dustin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's talk about dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those topics that our audience
is always curious about, and for good
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, I suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that cannabis is difficult to
dose properly for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would call it different, maybe not
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different than what medical providers
are used to, because we're used to saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, you've got high blood pressure here,
let me give you this number of milligrams,
[SPEAKER_01]: take it twice a day, and that's kind of
the standard prescription.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis really requires that we get into
more of a personalized recommendation,
[SPEAKER_01]: a personalized regimen for each person,
and not only that, but sometimes for each
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more individualized and therefore
more nuanced, but I think with some basic
[SPEAKER_01]: principles, it doesn't have to be
difficult or confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what are some of those basic
principles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, let's start out with the fact
that everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their response to cannabis,
in particular, their response to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm sitting across the room from a
new patient that's never tried cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: before and say they're wanting to use
cannabis for pain or sleep or anxiety or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else, I have no idea,
is this a two milligram person or a 20
[SPEAKER_01]: milligram person?
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally, it's that range and
sometimes even broader.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some people that would be sensitive
to as little as one milligram of THC when
[SPEAKER_01]: taken by mouth, and some people that can
go way higher than that without side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or tolerance building, which I'm sure
we'll talk about in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without knowing where someone's at in
their level of sensitivity, which probably
[SPEAKER_01]: has many factors that influence that,
including one's age, one's gender,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably less so influenced by one's size
or one's body weight, but there's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic factors in there, and we don't
know all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I don't know if you're a two or 20
milligram person, we start at two and we
[SPEAKER_01]: methodically work up through that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a lot of patient education on here's
what to look for when you start
[SPEAKER_01]: responding, here's what to look for when
you might start having adverse effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's going to inform you where that
therapeutic window is, like where's that
[SPEAKER_01]: range between what works for you and what
starts to cause side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we identify that, and it often
takes people anywhere between a week and
[SPEAKER_01]: even a month, depending on how slow and
cautious we're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll just comment on CBT.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBT, which is so similar to THC in a lot
of ways in terms of it can help a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the same things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can help with pain, inflammation,
anxiety, and so forth, but very different
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to dosing because people,
it's usually very forgiving, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: People rarely get into trouble taking too
much CBT.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more common problem is that they're
not taking enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the milligram dosing for CBT and THC is
way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think very few people are ever going to
feel two milligrams of CBT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people need to get to five or 10
milligrams before they even start to feel
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with CBT, often more is better,
especially if they're using a CBT,
[SPEAKER_01]: a really CBT dominant, like a hemp
preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually upper limit limited by cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people would be using
higher doses and getting better results if
[SPEAKER_01]: it weren't so expensive, but then there's
the opportunity to really do what I think
[SPEAKER_01]: so many of your listeners understand is
the combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really using both of them
strategically together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would imagine, too,
beyond just THC and CBD, there's terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's other minor cannabinoids that
could be playing a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that entourage effect further
complicate dosing considerations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the biggest influence is when
it comes to inhaled cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people are either smoking or
vaporizing cannabis flowers, or I will see
[SPEAKER_01]: extraordinary distinctions between one
variety of cannabis and another.
[SPEAKER_01]: One might be very uplifting and
energizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One might be very sedating.
[SPEAKER_01]: One might do nothing for pain,
but really help with anxiety and the
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some might stimulate appetite or suppress
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just really all over the place
with those varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in most situations,
once the flower is processed into an oil
[SPEAKER_01]: or a tincture or a capsule or edible or
something like that, a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: differences are kind of washed out with
the processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, more people in the cannabis industry
and my company, Healer, are one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaders in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on how do we get all the
virtues of that flower into a bottle or
[SPEAKER_01]: into a pill because those distinctions are
really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also, in my mind and in my
experience, a lot of rationale for
[SPEAKER_01]: blending the varieties together and having
a wide spectrum, kind of a shotgun
[SPEAKER_01]: approach product, which can be more
straightforward and easy to use and more
[SPEAKER_01]: versatile for a wide range of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so I guess getting back to your
question, terpenes, I think of that more
[SPEAKER_01]: as like the fine tuning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my first goal with a patient is to
kind of orient myself to their general
[SPEAKER_01]: dosing range, general sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, are they responding to
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, believe it or not, not everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who tries to use cannabis for pain or
sleep or one of these conditions receives
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit, even though most do, you know,
and those who don't usually we can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: switch to cannabis plan B and get some
good results there, too, because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: always so many different things to try in
the world of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they are responding, general
ballpark of what number of milligrams are
[SPEAKER_01]: we talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the big knob on the old
fashioned radio where you're like tuning
[SPEAKER_01]: into the station and then the fine tuning
that we do to follow up visit,
[SPEAKER_01]: which might have everything to do with the
terpene profile of the product they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what's been really exciting to me
are the acidic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been watching this for several
years now that THCA and CBDA in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: are powerful agents that have been
overlooked for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to be more, you know,
better tolerated, more effective,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially at very low doses than their
neutral counterparts, but not substitutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not in any way suggesting
that THCA is a substitute for THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They act very differently, but I almost
always recommend including some THCA in
[SPEAKER_01]: any THC product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, THCA does have some distinct
mechanisms of action that THC doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have, but also it's been shown to be a
positive allosteric modulator at the CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor, which means it can kind of turn
up the volume, turn up the activity and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually potentiate or make the THC more
potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're looking at right
now.
And number two, THC is a very powerful
agent that can be used in a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: ways, and more effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one could use a lower dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the pharmacokinetics are all
interacting, which means when we take
[SPEAKER_01]: these cannabinoids together, especially
say we take THCA and THC, we take them by
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth and they go to the liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now we've got two compounds that are
competing for metabolism in the liver,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that would slow the breakdown of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having some THCA in there, again,
kind of not only potentiates what we would
[SPEAKER_01]: call the pharmacodynamic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't only make the action of THC
more potent, but it slows its breakdown
[SPEAKER_01]: and therefore makes it last longer in the
system and be more potent in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, these acidic
cannabinoids are absorbed way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes them acidic is they have a
carboxylic acid functional group on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're a little bit more water soluble
and that increases their absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like the CBDA is absorbed
somewhere between five and 11 times better
[SPEAKER_01]: than CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: THCA might be absorbed up to 50 times
better than THC when taken by mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need much of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another really exciting piece
for improving results and being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: use a lower dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I would imagine being able to
use a lower dose is better for patients
[SPEAKER_00]: just because cost has to be such a
limiting factor when trying to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like kind of the nature of my
practice is cost-effective solutions to
[SPEAKER_01]: problems that have failed to respond to
conventional treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I've been doing for 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's finding a way for people to
afford this or to be able to produce their
[SPEAKER_01]: own and make their own and sometimes not
have to be able to do that without
[SPEAKER_01]: spending a lot of money on lab tests and
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these are two really important
strategies for empowering patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The self-cultivation and self-production
is just such a therapeutic activity unto
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that alone has great healing
power and the patient just feels so good
[SPEAKER_01]: about the fact that they've made something
that's now bringing them relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I support that in a lot of my patients
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously not legal for people to do
that everywhere, but it certainly is here
[SPEAKER_01]: in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you talked about when you're
starting with a patient, I have a starting
[SPEAKER_00]: dose to sort of be able to determine the
therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you typically start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a THC side of things, if there's
nothing that informs me that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: either super sensitive to THC or that
they're not that sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have no historical information like
that, I started two milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I warned them that the starting dose might
do zero for them, but we're going to go up
[SPEAKER_01]: methodically and find the dose that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some exceptions to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if it's a daytime treatment,
and somebody is very active and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: driving and I want to really make sure
that there's no impairment, I'll start
[SPEAKER_01]: with say one milligram.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a product here that's a one part
THC and four parts CBD with a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of the THCA and the CBDA in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a common kind of take with
breakfast recommendation I have would be
[SPEAKER_01]: start with five milligrams total of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's approximately one milligram of
THC and five of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a nice safe starting place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And believe it or not, a lot of people are
starting to say, yeah, I think I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: felt a little something there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as we go up, it starts getting
better and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of orients that lower end of
the dosing range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in preparation for talking to you
about dosing today, I went back and I
[SPEAKER_00]: watched the panel from CanMed 2019 that
you are a participant on along with a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of other doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys got into some really great
data, a lot of great information,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll share the link in the show notes
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that was really
interesting was sort of this biphasic
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that cannabinoids can have where at
a low dose, they can be not as effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: but and at a very high dose, they can't be
very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could talk more
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this sweet spot that we see in cannabis
is, yeah, this is what can I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is known for these dichotomies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everywhere you look in cannabinoid
research, you see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's going to show up in doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this would indicate that if someone
starts at a low dose and they gradually
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the dose for a little while
there, each dose increase is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: result in a stronger therapeutic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be one phase of the
relationship, a direct relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: between dose going up and therapeutic
effect going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at some point, there's kind of an
apex to that phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you increase the dose even more,
the therapeutic effect will start to
[SPEAKER_01]: diminish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what often happens to patients that
don't understand this is they're saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, I increased the dose and it's not
working as well as it used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something must be wrong with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should increase the dose even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That only makes sense to most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they increase the dose even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might temporarily feel a stronger
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then within a few days, they're
feeling even less of a therapeutic effect
[SPEAKER_01]: than they did previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they repeat and repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before long, they're taking this high
dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And barely feeling it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a process known as tolerance
building.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens readily with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also very easy to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can talk about that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another really strange thing about THC is
that it might not just be biphasic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be triphasic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at very high doses, they could start to
recover that direct relationship and have
[SPEAKER_01]: the therapeutic effect start growing again
in a positive direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that's going to be a much
more expensive treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually, the kind of maximal
therapeutic effect at the high dosing
[SPEAKER_01]: range isn't as nice, isn't as beneficial
to the patient as it is in that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: low moderate dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing is, though,
people, when they find their sweet spot,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if they really explore this dosing
range and figure out what is that maximum
[SPEAKER_01]: dose that gives me the benefit without the
tolerance building, without the loss of
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy, people are able to stay at that
dose for years or decades without it ever
[SPEAKER_01]: losing effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really benefits people to take the
time to methodically figure out what is
[SPEAKER_01]: their optimal dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when they know that, they're set.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can stay on that dose for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually, over time, people will start
to feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then their dose goes down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: As their health improves, they require
less and less cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the physiology just doesn't need it
as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the trend I typically see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people would never think,
oh, wow, the cannabis isn't working as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as it used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should reduce my dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not that intuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's actually what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder, and you can certainly tell
me if I'm wrong, but I mean, the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of having a cannabinoid therapy is to
make up for a deficiency in
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So could it be that by using cannabinoids,
it sort of retrained your system to be
[SPEAKER_00]: producing those endocannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's why you don't need to
supplement so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a lot of what we see in
that lower dosing range when we first
[SPEAKER_01]: start out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a handful of animal studies that
have shown when you administer THC to
[SPEAKER_01]: rodents in particular, at certain doses,
you can kind of upregulate either their
[SPEAKER_01]: production of endocannabinoids or their
CB1 receptor density, meaning how many
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors their cells are producing,
or the sensitivity of those receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some evidence to suggest this,
but I think this takes us back to this
[SPEAKER_01]: concept of therapeutic window,
what we see because this concept of
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance building can happen at different
rates in different parts of the body and
[SPEAKER_01]: different parts of the brain, and reverse
tolerance can also happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the really interesting
features I've recognized about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years is when I ask large groups
of people, the first time you ever smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis when you are a teenager,
or whatever, did you feel it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many hands go up like, no,
I did not feel it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people have to use it two or
three times to even experience it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that might just be due to the fact
that their kind of sensory awareness
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't attuned to that psychoactive shift,
and they didn't know that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: stoned, but they really were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's probably some of that,
but there's also some evidence suggesting
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was that first dose of cannabis
that kind of primed their system and then
[SPEAKER_01]: made them more sensitive to it,
when they took it the second time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from a therapeutic window
perspective, what I see when people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are cannabis naive, so they haven't used
cannabis before, when they first start
[SPEAKER_01]: using cannabis and we get kind of over
that threshold of some therapeutic effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the next few days, they become more
sensitive to that without changing the
[SPEAKER_01]: dose at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like say two milligrams did nothing,
three milligrams, I start to feel a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of relief in my back, okay,
stay at three milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: On day three or day four, that three
milligrams is starting to feel stronger
[SPEAKER_01]: than it did when they first started three
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be a widening of the
therapeutic window with the lowest
[SPEAKER_01]: effective dose actually going down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also get this widening of the
therapeutic window with the dose that
[SPEAKER_01]: causes the adverse effects getting pushed
back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this we typically see with some of the
motor effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people first kind of go over that
line into side effect territory,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things they report is either
dizziness or clumsiness or just feeling a
[SPEAKER_01]: little unsteady.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to do with kind of the
psychomotor response in some of the areas
[SPEAKER_01]: of the brain that control our body
movements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been shown that the areas of the
brain that control these physical
[SPEAKER_01]: functions will build tolerance to THC
faster than areas of the brain that
[SPEAKER_01]: control pain signaling or that control
anxiety or some of the other effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the cognitive and cerebral effects
of the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people could stay at that dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're feeling a little wobbly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, don't go up anymore,
but just stay at that dose for a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few days later, the wobbly thing is
gone, but the pain relief is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole idea that you can build the
tolerance to the adverse effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not to the benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do that, you got to be methodical
and you really have to be paying attention
[SPEAKER_01]: to your body's response and your mind's
response to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same with the memory loss,
same with the kind of the giggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anything, whether it's an adverse
effect in some situations and maybe not in
[SPEAKER_01]: others, but most of my patients don't want
to be high all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even without CBD, even with a pure THC
treatment, I really want to emphasize that
[SPEAKER_01]: people can get relief of pain,
relief of anxiety, spasm, many other
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms without getting into the
territory of impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if at first they're feeling a
little bit of that, they can build
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance to that and maintain that
therapeutic efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeing as though you need to take a
real methodical approach and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of patients that needs to be taken as well
with really finding the right dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is it for patients to work
with an experienced healthcare provider
[SPEAKER_00]: when trying to figure out their optimal
dose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really don't like to limit people
because unfortunately there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced healthcare providers out there
that work with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a big part of my mission is to help
people circumvent that if they need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, if you have the option of
seeing someone that's been treating
[SPEAKER_01]: patients with cannabis for five years or
something like that, I encourage any
[SPEAKER_01]: listener to at least explore that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're likely going to find some pearls
there that they wouldn't have found on
[SPEAKER_01]: their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus it's a lot of people just in general
in our society, but especially people that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been suffering for a long time and
have been through the medical system and
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't found the results they're looking
for, they might be less aware of their
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies and less aware of just kind of like
where they're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a patient yesterday who I said,
well, how have you been doing in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: month since I saw you last?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my back pain is a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much better?
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually I kind of fished out of her
that it was about 30% better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she really noticed that she was able
to do the dishes without having to stop a
[SPEAKER_01]: few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, anything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about your migraines?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of those have you had in the last
month?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, I've had none.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like she wouldn't even have known
that she wasn't paying attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wasn't taking notes on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a huge surprise for her when I
asked her that question, because
[SPEAKER_01]: previously it was one to two a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the listeners right now might be
thinking like, oh my God, how can this
[SPEAKER_01]: woman not know that she stopped having
migraines?
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people sometimes really benefit from a
third party there that can be more
[SPEAKER_01]: objective and hold them accountable and
ask the right questions and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: reflect back to them the progress and the
pitfalls and the successes.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help people accomplish that without the
help of a provider, I developed something
[SPEAKER_01]: really simple called the inner inventory,
which is just a three to four measure
[SPEAKER_01]: scale that takes about 30 seconds to
perform on oneself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a deep breath, you rate on a
scale from one to 10 how smooth and easy
[SPEAKER_01]: that was, you hold still for a few seconds
and you rate how comfortable you are in
[SPEAKER_01]: your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put on a fake smile and you
see how real it feels over the course of a
[SPEAKER_01]: few seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can rate that on a scale from one
to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if there's a primary symptom
you're dealing with, you can rate that
[SPEAKER_01]: symptom's intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with our products that we make,
we provide worksheets for people to record
[SPEAKER_01]: their inner inventory a few times a day,
basically before and a little while after
[SPEAKER_01]: their cannabis dosing and a shift in that
inner inventory is a nice sign that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're at a dose that they're starting to
feel a response to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's all sorts of ways to
circumvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I would recommend the
listeners, if you're using cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: your goal is optimal health and you have
access to someone like me that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this for a long time, it's probably
worth a consult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're new to cannabis and
you're worried about it and you just want
[SPEAKER_01]: someone to be there to support you and
supervise this, I think working with an
[SPEAKER_01]: expert is going to create a faster path to
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those resources sound great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to link those as well in the
show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I was going to ask
is, what about folks who are looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: use cannabis just for kind of general
wellness or just general well-being?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they don't have a specific
condition, but everyone wants to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that those principles would hold
true for those folks as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a great topic that I'm very
interested in, cannabis for health
[SPEAKER_01]: promotion and disease prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if you could take almost any
field in medicine, whether it's psychiatry
[SPEAKER_01]: or pain medicine or neurology or
gastroenterology, and take all the cases
[SPEAKER_01]: that have failed to respond to all of
their treatments and send them to me and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting success with 80 to 90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If cannabis can be so useful for all these
refractory conditions, what could it do to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent them?
[SPEAKER_01]: What could it do to keep people healthy?
[SPEAKER_01]: What could it do to help people perform at
their best and feel their best?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually wrote a chapter on this in a
book that's coming out in the next month
[SPEAKER_01]: or two that I wrote for physicians and
other clinicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, yeah, cannabis for health
promotion and disease prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some very basic principles
that I'll share with the listeners here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one is you do not want to build
tolerance to THC because building
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance to THC means you've
down-regulated your cannabinoid receptors
[SPEAKER_01]: and that means that you are undermining
the function of your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a system that is there to keep
you healthy, to respond to injury and to
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to illness and to keep everything
in balance in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no tolerance to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the number one rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another rule or another set of rules has
to do with using cannabis to support other
[SPEAKER_01]: lifestyle factors that are known to be
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not sleeping well,
ask your self, well, how can I use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis to optimize my sleep?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably a whole other podcast
worth of information there, but we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of that info on my website and people
can find that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you find that cannabis is a nice
adjunct to exercise, either because it
[SPEAKER_01]: makes you look forward to it more and do
it more frequently, or if it's because it
[SPEAKER_01]: helps you feel like you recover faster and
get ready for the next workout,
[SPEAKER_01]: use cannabis as an adjunct to exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use it as an adjunct to meditation or
spiritual practices to create creativity,
[SPEAKER_01]: to socializing, which I used to not have
to tell people to do that, but of course
[SPEAKER_01]: now in this day and age, so many of us are
socially isolated and really missing the
[SPEAKER_01]: healing aspect of those social connections
in our life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important that cannabis
can really deepen relationships quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: and help people open up and share and
collaborate creatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really essential when
it comes to health promotion and disease
[SPEAKER_01]: prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing that I want to
share is if you look at some societies
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world that have used cannabis
for this purpose, it's often the acidic
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that they're relying the most
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis tea is a wonderful tonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of this as something that you can do
that really has no downside, that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to help mitigate inflammation in the
body and kind of nudge your
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost every morning or about six days a
week, because I do take a cannabis fast
[SPEAKER_01]: one day a week myself, along with calories
and caffeine all on the same day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just throw a little bit of bud,
like maybe the size of a pea, a fresh pea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I throw that in the cup and maybe I'll add
another tea bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I won't pour hot water on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it steep for five minutes and drink
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know that you're not very
sensitive to THC, you could even eat that
[SPEAKER_01]: little bud at the end of the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will get some THC in that dose,
but it might not be a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on how strong the
flower is and how big of a bud you pinched
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis tea is a wonderful tonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like people to think about,
a lot of my patients, as they get better
[SPEAKER_01]: and better, we kind of transition their
treatment to, how can I use this as a
[SPEAKER_01]: crutch to manage my life, to get on top of
my healthcare, to become more
[SPEAKER_01]: self-efficient?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it shifts to cannabis as a tonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I use this to stay healthy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tea is a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that stuck out to me
when you were talking was this whole idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of building a tolerance to THC and how
that could actually hinder your body's own
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never really thought of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks who unfortunately maybe use a little
too much THC could actually be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves a disservice because you're
affecting the way that your
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that a lot of the listeners,
well, first of all, I want to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally okay to overuse THC to build
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no judgment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a useful experience to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that a lot of the listeners
who have had that experience where they
[SPEAKER_01]: found themselves smoking joints all day
long for weeks at a time, and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: realized at the end of a joint,
wow, I didn't really feel anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet if you really look at yourself,
when you stopped using it a couple days
[SPEAKER_01]: later or a few days later, I bet you
started to feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this doesn't happen to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere around 50% of heavy cannabis
smokers will experience a withdrawal
[SPEAKER_01]: syndrome, which is not that strong,
but it's irritability, loss of appetite,
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble sleeping, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people, after they stop using
it, they suddenly start to feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: normal is the new high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that feels really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to feel like that more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's an important transition
point between the crutch and the tonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a cannabis user and it really is
helping you, you're likely going to feel a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot better after you use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would encourage you to watch for when
you don't feel better after you use it or
[SPEAKER_01]: when you feel even a little worse after
you use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that your body will
show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pay attention and you're honest
with yourself, you'll note that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really beautiful
communication from your system that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: time to shift your relationship with
cannabis into a different mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So watch for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this process of regaining our
endocannabinoid receptors can happen
[SPEAKER_01]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been shown in one MRI study,
at least in men, to happen over a period
[SPEAKER_01]: of 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're dabbing or smoking joints all
day long and you don't feel it at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can stop for 48 hours, start at,
say, a 50% lower dose, and you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you like to spend half as much
money on your medicine and feel it either
[SPEAKER_01]: the same or more with less side effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only upside for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why years ago on healer.com,
we put up this free program called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensitization Protocol, which really holds
people's hand and walks them through not
[SPEAKER_01]: just those 48 hours, but I do give a lot
of strategies for how you can deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: those 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier for some than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's exercises and meditations and
foods you can eat and all sorts of things
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do to get through that period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a guide for how to very
consciously restart the cannabis at a
[SPEAKER_01]: lower dose and watch what it does for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And winding down here, I did want to ask
you about product variability and how that
[SPEAKER_00]: can sort of play into finding the right
dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe you were using a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You found the right dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then for whatever reason, that
product's not available at that dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can that sort of throw everything off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's some value in that,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: For years, people have been telling me
that if I just grew one strain in my
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard for the whole year, it seems to
not work as well as if I grew four and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of switch between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll do a couple of weeks with one
and a couple of weeks with another or one
[SPEAKER_01]: in the morning and one in the night,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think to keep... Well,
let me say that physiology tends not to be
[SPEAKER_01]: static.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really do well with fluctuations in our
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's biological life for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't think it makes sense to
really strive to use the same exact
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis at the same exact dose every day
for a long, long period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, little fluctuations are okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skip a dose once in a while or get a
product that's very similar but slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lady yesterday who's in her mid
70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, I don't know why they sold
me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was buying the Indica every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, what did you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, it works, but it doesn't
seem to work quite as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, that's a fine
experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back there next time and say the Indica
works better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a big deal in my mind is when the
label is just way off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, we see this so often in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what if this lady goes to the next
dispensary and because of the label on the
[SPEAKER_01]: first product, she thinks she's a 10
milligram doser.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she asked the dispensary agent,
how many drops of this is 10 milligrams?
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever they tell her, maybe she's
getting 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this might sound unusual to
listeners, but this is not unusual to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is happening all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because first of all, the testing labs
have a lot of inconsistencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't necessarily measure how many
drops are in a milliliter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just picking some number
between 20 and 50 and saying that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how many and then doing the math there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times, the labels don't make it
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the patient actually has to try to
bust out a calculator and figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams per milliliter and drops per
milliliter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've really put a lot of attention and
time into simplifying that for patients
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Healer line of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both our hemp products and our THC
containing products that we have in Maine
[SPEAKER_01]: and in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we include dosing guides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just so often that people are
making mistakes having to do with either
[SPEAKER_01]: inaccurate labeling or misleading or
confusing labeling of the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the real pitfall is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to, you know,
a certain preparation being like the one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I sometimes see that in my
patients with seizures where we can really
[SPEAKER_01]: determine, like, wow, you pretty much are
getting the same dose of CBD or THC that
[SPEAKER_01]: you were getting before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but really, this product isn't working
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the parents are like, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do see some real specificity,
not in all seizure patients, but in a few
[SPEAKER_01]: seizure patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, I think variability is OK,
as long as you're in kind of that same
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it must have to be a certain
psychological mindset you need to be into,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, is to kind of be open that there
might be a little variability and to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to to roll with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Ben, our yeah, I think we've our
species has really lost its comfort with
[SPEAKER_01]: ambiguity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we all really want to pin it
down and identify all the discrete,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of cause and effect
relationships in our life, not just with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but with so many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's extremely stressful
because we're living in such a complex
[SPEAKER_01]: system and we are we are such a complex
system that we can't really always pin
[SPEAKER_01]: down all the discrete causes and effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I invite the listeners to
be comfortable with ambiguity whenever it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes up in their life and they don't they
don't really understand what's happening
[SPEAKER_01]: or they can't be certain they're getting
the right dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what I tell my patients is that
if you accidentally take a thousand times
[SPEAKER_01]: the dose of this medicine, you know,
a thousand times the dose I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: recommending, it's not going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to cause any brain damage
or organ damage or anything else like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be sick for a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have someone put you in a calm,
reassuring environment and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: call me if that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's you know, people do make mistakes
and sometimes there's great lessons that
[SPEAKER_01]: come out of that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last question before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a lot about having resources to
help patients with their dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about physicians or health care
providers who are maybe new to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and want to start recommending it to their
patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of resources are available to
them to help to help guide their patients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, my supreme offering is this
book that I've been working on for the
[SPEAKER_01]: last year and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out through Norton
Professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though on major booksellers,
it says the release date is August,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably going to be in the next
month or two that it's released and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: available for pre-order right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the best I have to offer you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Handbook of Cannabis for
Clinicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's some other resources I want
to put out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to point you to one is the Society
of Cannabis Clinicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great membership organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just released a new curriculum of
about 20 modules that you can take online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a nice resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Healer.com, which is my free
patient education website.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a paid training certification
program on there, which includes kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: bite sized online modules, plus a bunch of
videos and then a monthly webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the monthly webinar is actually free.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everyone to attend.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the training program, we have all
the previous webinars that are all
[SPEAKER_01]: timestamped so people can go right to a
topic that's important for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was originally designed for
dispensary agents and for caregivers and
[SPEAKER_01]: people that were just wanting,
you know, kind of lay people that were
[SPEAKER_01]: really wanting to dig in deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we found is now we've got 200
clinicians that are in that program and
[SPEAKER_01]: they all love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think because it's it's just kind of
very concise, quickly applicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was my goal with it is to
make not not to make this a scientifically
[SPEAKER_01]: dense curriculum, but to empower people to
get good results very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of my education on Healer.com,
I think, is empowering, even even
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say start with my patient
education material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's all you're going to need and
you're going to, you know, pick it up
[SPEAKER_01]: faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are those are the resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CannabisClinicians.org for the Society
of Cannabis Clinicians, Healer.com and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the book Handbook of Cannabis for
Clinicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you're going to be
participating in our medical practicum at
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'll be a great resource for
clinicians as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so sad to miss CanMed this year,
and I know it's going to happen again.
[SPEAKER_01]: CanMed has been a wonderful conference and
a great resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that clinicians that have that
attended the 2019 that I've stayed in
[SPEAKER_01]: touch with felt so empowered by that by
that one day session that we had there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was kind of like the soup to
nuts in one day that that was such a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful offering and a great attendance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we really made a difference in
the world with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I greatly look forward to the next
CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do as well.
