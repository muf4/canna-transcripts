[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for having me this afternoon
and giving me the opportunity to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I'm going to talk about effect of
container size on plant growth and
[SPEAKER_02]: development of cannabis-rhoderalis hybrids
in controlled greenhouse environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this work was done by me and William
Zittel at Amaz Zittel & Sons in Eden,
[SPEAKER_02]: New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eden is located a little south of Buffalo,
New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do primarily at Zittel's company
that we are flowering plant growers and we
[SPEAKER_02]: are also rooting station for ball
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We produce three million rooted cuttings
for ball horticulture in a year and also
[SPEAKER_02]: potted plants in controlled greenhouse
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides rooting station, we are also 350
acres in vegetable production,
[SPEAKER_02]: both organic and traditional.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this year, in 2019 January,
we were given the New York State pilot
[SPEAKER_02]: research project for hemp, the licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started our, we are fairly new in
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this year we did, produced the
feminized clones of cannabis etiva in our
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses of nine different varieties
and transplanted them into 21 acres in the
[SPEAKER_02]: field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also in addition to cannabis etiva,
we also grew auto flowering hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is cannabis-rhoderalis hybrids that
I'm going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did a field production as well as
greenhouse production of auto flower hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is auto flower hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: The original cannabis-rhoderalis are very
small in size and they are considered
[SPEAKER_02]: mutant varieties and they are native to
Asia, Siberia, Europe, Russia,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they are adapted to very extreme
environmental, especially cold conditions
[SPEAKER_02]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because they have to finish the life
cycle in a very short period of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: they complete their life cycle from seed
to finish in about 70 to 80 days,
[SPEAKER_02]: but certain hybrid varieties, they
complete between 70 to 90 days as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see this was our, just
beginning we started some trials,
[SPEAKER_02]: how they grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first picture is in one gallon
and they already produce the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in about eight inch long plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the other growing conditions are,
as I said, the auto flower varieties are
[SPEAKER_02]: shorter life cycles, 70 to 90 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a higher bud to leaf ratio,
which is 50 to 60%.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have more buds than leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And versus compared to the other cannabis
etiva varieties, they have 20 to 35%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bud to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other good phenomenon with auto
flower hemp is the fertilizer requirement
[SPEAKER_02]: is very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is almost 50% of the traditional
cannabis etiva varieties rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use 50% lower fertilizer requirement
up to 50 days until they finish flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we can further reduce it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the CBD levels of the seeds that we
have used range from 15 to 22%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are pretty short.
[SPEAKER_02]: The height, maximum height reaches to
three feet to four feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a dominant cola dominant in
fluorescence and buds and very few side
[SPEAKER_02]: branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of the short cycle,
it is possible in the Eastern US region to
[SPEAKER_02]: have two cycles in the field, starting
from May 15th after the frost danger is
[SPEAKER_02]: over until October 15th.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can do two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the greenhouse, of course,
we can have multiple production cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another interesting phenomena with the
auto flower hemp is the outside light
[SPEAKER_02]: duration does not affect the flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is why it is called auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they automatically switch from
vegetative cycle to the flowering stage
[SPEAKER_02]: with the age of the plant and they are not
dependent on the photo period like other
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis varieties that we need 12 hour,
12 hour dark and light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the age they flower and they want
to finish the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other theory is that they cannot be
cloned because they cannot take any stress
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the hypothesis we wanted to test and
the auto flowering hemp, which is cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: rural is crossed with sativa, the seeds
that we obtained, they were extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive to container size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a significant yield reduction
can happen if they are kept in the
[SPEAKER_02]: seedling plug for a longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third is cannot be cloned.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tested the first two hypothesis,
but the cloning we will do in our future
[SPEAKER_02]: studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our objective was to compare direct
seed sowing and compare with the
[SPEAKER_02]: transplanting from plug liners on plant
growth and development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the method we used is the seeds were
sown in a three gallon container by direct
[SPEAKER_02]: seed sowing and seeds were also sown in a
40 milliliter, these are Ellipods cells
[SPEAKER_02]: that we create different sizes in our
operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about two inches tall and about
one and a half inches in the diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are Ellipods and we also use the
OSS plant as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So seeds were planted either in three
gallon container direct sowing or they
[SPEAKER_02]: were planted in the seedling plugs and
then they were transplanted into three
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon at different time period or
different age of the seedling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So total crop time is 70 days from seeding
to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started in June one and then harvested
in first week of August.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the method we used for our experiment,
we did side by side in our greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had our regular production of auto
flower hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we did the experiment to prove
the hypothesis to develop our protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the feminized seeds of sunbeam haze was
obtained from Prism hemp in Buffalo,
[SPEAKER_02]: New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: The company is located in Buffalo,
New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also from Kaiji in California,
the KG9201 and KG9202 were obtained from
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaiji.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all three varieties of the seeds were
either directly planted in three gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: containers and also in the Ellipod or OSS
plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from OSS plug, they were transplanted
after eight days, 15 days, 22 days and 29
[SPEAKER_02]: days into three gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eventually they were all in three
gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the seed germination was quite
optimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Average was 94%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for all three varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And besides planting them in the
containers, we also planted, started them
[SPEAKER_02]: in the plugs and then planted them in the
field as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So seeds were pre-soaked in the water for
a faster germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were planted in either in
the three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used a custom blend soil from Gurje.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very well rinsed soil with the bark in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we incorporated root seal,
which is a biological fungicide in
[SPEAKER_02]: trichoderma for preventative reaction as
in for pythium, other fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had root seal in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and irrigation was done by trickle
irrigation in the three gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So direct sowing in three gallon and then
also we did in the Ellipods in the
[SPEAKER_02]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I didn't have all the pictures of
all the growing cycles because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is at day 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: We harvested at day 70, but this is right
before, about a week before harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants have already matured and leaves
are going into senescence and the buds are
[SPEAKER_02]: already ready to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not use any supplemental light
because we wanted to use the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: sunlight in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is first year we are doing
research and we wanted to see how,
[SPEAKER_02]: how to optimize the conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we have to improve next year,
we will implement more lights in
[SPEAKER_02]: summertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So besides, this is just a glimpse of our
other cannabis sativa, not the otter
[SPEAKER_02]: flower that we grew in our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, these are mother plants of nine
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grew them under LED light of red and blue
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from these, we took our feminized
clones and planted in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did about 50,000 clones in a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going back, coming back to the sunbeam
haze, which is a otter flower again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the mature buds of the sunbeam
haze at maturity at 70 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So see it has got a dominant single whole
line, just few, very few branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I said, we had our production in
three gallon of otter flower in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse and side by side we had our
experiments as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at day 70, the plants were harvested at
the soil level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were loaded up in the truck,
in the bags for, we sold all the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested plants to a processing company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did not do any extraction or
anything, so much easier for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see me with the whole thing,
the whole plant is no more than three and
[SPEAKER_02]: three and a half feet tall with the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is at day 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also grew this otter flower hemp in
the field, started them in the plugs and
[SPEAKER_02]: planted them in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the picture of right before
harvest around day 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is the KG9202 from Kayajin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has got more purple maroon leaves and
buds are also maroon and purple and very
[SPEAKER_02]: distinct smell in it, fragrance you can
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second one is the KG9201 and in
the background they are all sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did majority is the, I'm sorry,
sunbeam hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did majority of the otter flower of
sunbeam hemp and the very few number of
[SPEAKER_02]: Kayajin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for our production, the crew they
harvested and sent it to a processing
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then for our experiment, we tried
different drying methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since I said this is our first year,
it's a research basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tried different methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hung them in the greenhouse with the
put the shade on and then also put them on
[SPEAKER_02]: our propagation benches with the air
circulation going from underneath and top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we added some additional circulation
fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they dried to about eight or 9%
humidity level in July, in August in about
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's more pictures of the drying
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think by hanging was better than
putting them in the trays and on the
[SPEAKER_02]: benches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third one in this picture is the
buds of KG9202.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is very loose buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we measured the plant growth and yield
measurements at day 35 and day 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: And counted the number of buds and
branches at day 35 and 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: And noted the flower initiation period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on day 70 at the harvest, we
determined the fresh weight and dry weight
[SPEAKER_02]: of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also then removed the buds and took
the dry weight of the buds and took the
[SPEAKER_02]: growth data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is some of the graphs I'm going to
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is plant growth data at day 35 after
seed planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comparing direct seeding with eight days
in the plug and then transfer into three
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon, 15 days in plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then transfer into three gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, at this stage, they are all in
three gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were transplanted at different
time from the seedling plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we can see here, the direct seeding
has the maximum height and number of
[SPEAKER_02]: branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as the number of days in the seedling
plug increase, there is a decrease in the
[SPEAKER_02]: height of the plant and decrease in the
number of branches as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did not harvest at day 35.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I only have plant height and number of
branch data right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also they started flowering at day 35
on the direct seeding and eight days in
[SPEAKER_02]: plug and 15 days in plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at day 70, we harvested the plants and
then we took the plant height data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first one is the sunbeam haze is
the blue line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then KG9202 is the orange red.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the three is KG9202.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant height achieved only 35,
36 inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We measured everything in inches and
ounces and pounds because that goes with
[SPEAKER_02]: our production matrix system, not in
centimeters or other growth measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So direct seeding on the harvest day,
they only got to 35, 36 inches for all
[SPEAKER_02]: three varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And day eight, there is a little
inhibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And day 15, there is not much difference
between direct seeding and day 15 in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the decline started or inhibition in
the growth started after 22 days and
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly reduced at 29 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you keep the plug seedlings for 29
days in the plugs, there will be
[SPEAKER_02]: significant decline in your total yield
and the growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the number of branches followed the
same trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are some of the pictures
comparing the first one is the,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I cannot see, we cannot read
the numbers or the label very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when I compress the slides,
it came easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one is on the sunbeam haze,
this is direct seeding in three gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next one is eight days in the
plugs, then transplanted in three gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, there is a decline in the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, we took eight replicates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a representative of just
one sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 15 days, there is not much
difference in the plant growth between
[SPEAKER_02]: direct sowing and 15 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you go to, in the second picture,
the first one is direct sowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 22 days and 29 days, there is a
decline in the plant height.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same trend with the kaya gene seeds as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is a direct seed and second
one, 22 days in the plugs and 29 days in
[SPEAKER_02]: the plugs, they cause significant increase
and decrease in the plant height.
[SPEAKER_02]: And number of buds at mature estate we
counted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sunbeam haze was quite steady until 22
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that 29 days, they declined,
but other two, they started declining
[SPEAKER_02]: after 22 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is always on eight days,
there is a decline or inhibition in the
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was why it's not going in
the same pattern?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why on eight days, there is an inhibition
of growth, but in 15 days, it is very
[SPEAKER_02]: close to direct seeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our theory was that when the seedlings
are in eight days in a plugs, the taproot
[SPEAKER_02]: is developing and they are just starting
to develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is not enough secondary or tertiary
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we transplant them into a three
gallon in a different soil, different soil
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture in different media from a plugs
to the three gallon, so they go into a
[SPEAKER_02]: stress and because the otter flower hemp
doesn't like any kind of stress,
[SPEAKER_02]: so this is what is showing that eight days
is too early to transplant and that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: we are seeing an inhibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by 15 days in the plugs, the normal
root growth is occurred and when we
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant them into a bigger size
container, they grow nicely and they
[SPEAKER_02]: establish well and that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is not much inhibition in the
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw the similar results when we planted
eight days in the plugs to the field or 15
[SPEAKER_02]: days in the plug in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eight days in the plugs to the field,
they remain a little stunted until the
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we harvested the whole plant and
we took the total fresh weight of the
[SPEAKER_02]: total plant and we dried them for about 12
days and we took the dry weight of the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole plant because this is how we sold
the whole plant to the extraction company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They bought the plants on the basis of the
whole biomass, not on the basis of buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the direct seeding, the first one
again is 4.5 ounces per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Per plant and eight days there is an
inhibition and by 15 days is very close to
[SPEAKER_02]: direct seeding, not much decline in the
biomass and then by day 22 days and then
[SPEAKER_02]: 29 days there is a significant decline in
the plant biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the target point is 15 days,
no further than that we can keep in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we measure the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: At 9% moisture at day 70 and similar
trend, decline at eight days but further
[SPEAKER_02]: decline compared from direct seed to 15
days, there is some inhibition and then by
[SPEAKER_02]: 22 days and 29 days, much more inhibition
of the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we calculated the ultimate goal
is, now what is the reduction,
[SPEAKER_02]: percent reduction if we compare direct
seeding or start them in the seedling plug
[SPEAKER_02]: at different time transplanting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we compare this with the direct seed to
different timings.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we consider direct seed as 0% reduction
in the age of the buds, then on eight days
[SPEAKER_02]: in the plugs, there is between 13 to 26%
reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the body yield and then on 15 days in
the plugs, there is only 5% to 12%
[SPEAKER_02]: reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if we keep it further for 22 days
and 29 days, we can have up to 68%
[SPEAKER_02]: reduction in the yield, which is quite
significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sunbeam is much more, I think,
sensitive to this container size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the results are that the direct seeding
in a three gallon container produce the
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum yield and maximum number of
flowers and the buds and plant height and
[SPEAKER_02]: width and branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just a little side note, when the
seedlings were kept in the plug liners for
[SPEAKER_02]: 28 days or more, they started flowering
right in the plug liners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the summary of these studies are that
the results demonstrate that the auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flower hemp plants are very sensitive to
transplant shock and any other kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so transplanting from liner should be
completed by 15 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe for certain varieties, we can keep
up to 22 days, but to be safe 15 days is
[SPEAKER_02]: the timeline deadline to be kept in the
plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But direct seeding is recommended for
maximum growth and yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometime direct seeding is not
possible when you are planting in the
[SPEAKER_02]: field, because if you plant the seeds in
the field, because of the weather
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions and rain, you can wash the,
each seed is $1.50 price, so we cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: afford to lose the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to start them in the seedling
plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: So start them in seedling plugs,
keep them for 15 days, then transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you are growing in the greenhouse
conditions, then direct seeding is
[SPEAKER_02]: recommended.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to thank Kaya Jean Californian
for providing us the seeds for this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you all for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many plants per acre did you put in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: For auto flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: For auto flower hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: We did one feet apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because the plant diameter is about one
feet, we can, I have that data with me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can show you later.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do four feet, three feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually Kaya Jean's scientist,
one of the scientists came and did some
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did on one feet and four feet distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know the results yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did it one feet and we got our
harvest data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got about nine times more bud yield in
the field compared to the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and what was your harvest per acre
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have just harvested and we are just
getting the data from the, from our
[SPEAKER_02]: suppliers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have some numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got about 3,300 pounds for 2,000
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2,000 plants we planted in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty good for a short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds that you had, those were
feminized seeds, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: They are also feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what percentage either were male or
hermaphroditic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we bought 20,000 seeds from Sandeem
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only seven was male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's a good number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many, on the Ruderalis outdoor hemp
seeds, how many harvests per summer did
[SPEAKER_01]: you end up getting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we are in the field production for
vegetables, we have 150 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for just for hemp, for otter flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: the company who are processing,
they brought their crew, like four people,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: The greenhouse, they harvested 20,000
plants in about four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty fast because they are so
small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how many cycles?
[SPEAKER_02]: This year we just did one cycle,
but it is possible two cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Buffalo in New York area,
the weather is very unpredictable,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperature can go down very quickly
and frost can come in like early or late
[SPEAKER_02]: October, or late September.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't want to take a chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I want to do in a greenhouse and
increase the yield, we would definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: implement supplemental lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, this was first year was a pilot
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did different trials and we didn't
want to take a risk with the hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: acres, but I think we did very well this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are going to harvest our cannabis
sativa just starting maybe next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we did very well on the yield on
the regular sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think based on our financial numbers,
how we make profits next year,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are going to go much bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 42 seconds for questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, wait, wait, you got two seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did those plants produce any THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: The THC has to be below 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be because... So you didn't
gene edit out the THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thanks.
