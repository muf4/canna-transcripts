[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice I'm lowering the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to go quickly through
this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email is there, ethanroost.comcast.net.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be happy to send a 2004 paper that
goes through some old data, and I've just
[SPEAKER_00]: submitted a newer paper that reviews all
this data and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, when it's accepted,
it'll be open source, in keeping with
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk today about a
theory I developed that I call clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypothesis was that we all have an
underlying endocannabinoid tone that
[SPEAKER_00]: reflects the amount of CB1 receptors and
the amount of the endocannabinoids we have
[SPEAKER_00]: and how fast they're produced or broken
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the theory is that due to a genetic
condition or an acquired condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as a head injury that produces
migraine-like post-traumatic headaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid tone becomes deficient
and a variety of symptoms result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came up with this theory about the
year 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple of initial publications and
then a larger review paper in 2004,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you'll find here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to focus on today from this
long list of disorders is the top three in
[SPEAKER_00]: red, migraine, fibromyalgia, and irritable
bowel syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are what I call comorbid
conditions, meaning that they tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: appear in the same individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of things in common.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all hyperalgesic states,
meaning that the pain is there even though
[SPEAKER_00]: the tissue looks normal and it's more than
it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no characteristic tissue pathology
if you look at the tissues under the
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope, and there are no lab tests for
any of these disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headache disorders, headaches appeared
in about 97% of fibromyalgia patients when
[SPEAKER_00]: that was examined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, over a third of people who had
chronic daily headache had criteria that
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated a diagnosis of fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, again, about a third of
patients with irritable bowel had
[SPEAKER_00]: fibromyalgia, and a third of the
fibromyalgia patients had irritable bowel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the olden days, these were called
psychosomatic disorders, and if a patient
[SPEAKER_00]: came in and had migraine, fibromyalgia,
and irritable bowel at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: chances are that it was a woman and she
was labeled as having a somatization
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder by the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we all make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start by looking at
irritable bowel syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frequently said this is a lifelong
condition, but a lot of people really
[SPEAKER_00]: develop it after a bad exposure,
like they had oysters or something else
[SPEAKER_00]: that went bad on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an episode of food poisoning or
especially after antibiotic treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it may become a lifelong
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite being called functional or assumed
to be psychosomatic, this is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: frequent diagnosis in gastroenterology
practices in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: No physical signs or patho-pneumonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a diagnosis of exclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get a colonoscopy and a bunch of
other blood tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all come back negative, and we call
it IBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are formal criteria called the Rome
criteria for this diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called a disorder of unknown origin
as being treated by agents with an unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, everything in the kitchen
sink gets thrown at this, usually with bad
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a visceral hypersensitivity with
features of gastrointestinal allodynia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that even a little stretch is
perceived as pain and an overabundance
[SPEAKER_00]: thereof.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been looked at in relation to the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This group from Australia looked at
colonic smooth muscle and circular muscle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they showed that anandamide
co-localized with the cholinergic
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors that are the main propulsive
force in the colon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some kind of non-CB1
mechanism or an alternative cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism that seemed to be operative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suggested the endocannabinoid system
is functionally important in disease and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially inflammatory states that would
include irritable bowel syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then subsequently, this group looked at a
small randomized controlled study,
[SPEAKER_00]: 52 normal patients that took 7.5
milligrams of THC, versus placebo,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were able to show increases in
colonic compliance, the stretchability,
[SPEAKER_00]: also decreases in tone after meals,
and decreased pressure in the colon with a
[SPEAKER_00]: trend towards relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shows that this does perform a
modulatory function in the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at Mayo Clinic, there were a couple
of studies where they looked at some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different forms of IBS mixed the
situations where it's predominantly
[SPEAKER_00]: constipation and those predominantly
diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the variant IBS with diarrhea,
which is the most common, they tried THC
[SPEAKER_00]: as Marinol, and they showed a delayed
colonic transit in subjects with this
[SPEAKER_00]: CNRI, RS806378, CT, I'll let you read that
next time, that particular genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the same group showed a
significant association of the same gene
[SPEAKER_00]: with colonic transit in the patients with
IBS-D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said CB1 receptor-related
mechanisms modify colonic transit and
[SPEAKER_00]: sensation and may influence the
development of symptoms in Caucasian
[SPEAKER_00]: patients with IBS, particularly IBS-D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So limiting the applicability,
but many of these same things would apply
[SPEAKER_00]: to a more general population.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very interesting study last year,
Nina Clooney on her group in Calgary,
[SPEAKER_00]: Alberta.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard recent reports that
people were surprised that THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: when used chronically, led to a lower
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the archetype has been a skinny hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been a fat slacker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in her group, Nina was able to show
that THC altered the microbiome balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard a little bit before about normal
flora in the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in obese DIO mice that have this
mutation, there was a change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: firmicutes-bacteroidities ratio that was
statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, THC prevented weight gain
despite a high-fat diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows, again, this important
interaction between cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system, normal flora
in the gut, and weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bestseller last year called
Brain Maker by Perlmutter all about
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics and prebiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probiotics, of course, are normal bacteria
that get in yogurt or kefir, those kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of foods, the fermented foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are fed, in turn, by prebiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are sources of dietary fiber
from vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going from top to bottom, left to
right, we have acacia senegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: gum arabic, chicory, Jerusalem artichokes,
dandelion greens, burdock, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole onion family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have one of these kinds of
problems, that's a book worth reading,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are vegetables worth eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, in turn, I believe, will
positively affect your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shifting to fibromyalgia, Schley et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: did an uncontrolled study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was really a strange study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had nine fibromyalgia patients,
and they gave them THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their ethics committee wouldn't let them
use a placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was an observational study,
because they were pushing the doses of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: alone, and it has a lousy therapeutic
index.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of dropouts, five out of
the nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the four subjects who completed the
study per protocol had prominent
[SPEAKER_00]: reductions in their perceived pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are fibromyalgia patients whose
pain threshold is diminished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was statistically significant,
as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not really fair to look at a
protocol population, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was the best we've got, considering
the limitations we have on these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a study done in Canada, they used
Nabalone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a semi-synthetic THC analog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty patients with fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using one milligram BID, which would be
equivalent to about 20 milligrams of THC a
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you're going to have side
effects at that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after four weeks, there were
significant improvements in pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: fibromyalgia impact questionnaire,
and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a significant signal there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Mark Wehr, also in Canada,
looked again at Nabalone versus
[SPEAKER_00]: amitriptyline.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit lower doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: At those doses, there wasn't any effect on
pain in the fibromyalgia patients or mood
[SPEAKER_00]: or quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was improvement in sleep,
which is one of the cardinal symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sine qua non.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inferiably, there's a sleep disturbance
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the patient will not get better until
that's addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another study done with cannabis but
acutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't a long-range study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty-eight patients with cannabis versus
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: After two hours, the visual analog scales
for these various parameters were
[SPEAKER_00]: different to a significant level,
particularly pain, stiffness, enhancement
[SPEAKER_00]: of relaxation, but increase in side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also a significant increase in
insomnia and insomniac insomniac as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the increase in the mental
health component of the SF-36 was also
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly higher, going along with
psychoactive changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this, as we've been hearing,
very low doses are probably what are
[SPEAKER_00]: required here, and those that hopefully
will not produce these kind of acute side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, our best evidence is probably this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I am a proponent of randomized
control trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only thing the FDA and other
regulatory bodies will accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is a very interesting
survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came out a couple of years ago from
the National Pain Report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 1,300 patients with fibromyalgia who
answered this questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were self-selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three FDA-approved drugs to treat
fibromyalgia, being duloxetine,
[SPEAKER_00]: milnacipran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are dual serotonin and adrenergic
reuptake inhibitors, so antidepressants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then pregabalin, an anticonvulsant
masquerading as an analgesic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the graphs, this is the
percent improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that with the three
prescriptions, you don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: green.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got 10% or less showing these to be
very effective, only about 30% or less
[SPEAKER_00]: showing them as helping a little,
and the vast majority saying they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: help at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to cannabis, where 62% thought
that they were very effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: and very much fewer thought that they were
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd call this a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a no contest at best, and it should
indicate a future direction of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving into migraine, and we'll go through
this quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the thing that got me into the
study of cannabis 20 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd known for a long time that
cannabis was effective in treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine, both acutely and chronically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only been in the last decade or
so that we have some real evidence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship to the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the studies have come from
Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this, they showed an increase in the
nanomide membrane transporter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and FI activity, FI being the enzyme that
breaks down a nanomide, were shown in the
[SPEAKER_00]: platelets of female migraineurs,
and compared to patients with tension,
[SPEAKER_00]: headache, and controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The levels of CB1 were equivalent in the
groups, but there was an increased
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation of nanomide by platelets,
and decreased blood levels in the female
[SPEAKER_00]: migraineurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, those were significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ackerman et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: did a series of three studies showing a
very important relationship of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system to migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They showed that nanomide reduced dural
blood vessel dilation by calcitonin gene
[SPEAKER_00]: related peptide 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also by these other agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed to work presynaptically to
prevent the CGRP-induced nitric oxide
[SPEAKER_00]: release and smooth muscle of the dural
arteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They showed that nanomide was tonically
released and had a modulatory role in the
[SPEAKER_00]: trigeminal vascular system that's felt to
be the pathophysiological mechanism in
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next study, they looked at a
nanomide and showed that it caused an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in dural vessel diameter caused
by capsaesapine, and that doses required
[SPEAKER_00]: were pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go on from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly here, they were looking at
synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are much more powerful than THC,
but again, there's a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably our best piece of evidence is
this one done in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this study, they looked at things like
did cerebral spinal fluid, did spinal taps
[SPEAKER_00]: on normal patients and patients with
migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I proposed this study in 2004,
but didn't feel it could be done in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viva Italia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they showed this tremendously
significant difference in the nanomide
[SPEAKER_00]: levels being decreased in the migraineurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One chance in 10,000 that this is due to
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically they said here that this
seemed to lie at the root of the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: in migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another study from Italy, both 2-AG and
nanomide were markedly reduced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: platelets of migraineurs as compared to
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, very highly statistically
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from an animal model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, showing the importance of the
various nuclei in the brainstem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a genetic study, Yuhash et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CB1 gene, CNR1, mapped to chromosome
6q1415 was linked to migraine with
[SPEAKER_00]: haplotypic tagging with high significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they related this to other migraine
cocomitants such as photophobia,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sensitivity of light, nausea and
disability.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also related it to some personality
traits such as neuroticism, guilty as
[SPEAKER_00]: charged, depression and other tendencies
towards drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, bad thing to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another observational study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came out of Colorado just a few weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were patients selected to get
cannabis to treat migraine and 2 thirds of
[SPEAKER_00]: the patients had used cannabis previously,
but there was a very significant decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: in attack rate from 10.4 to 4.6 attacks
per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: 85% had decreased frequency and almost 40%
had other benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, obviously this is an uncontrolled
population, self-selected and no control
[SPEAKER_00]: group, but it surely indicates that the
study I tried to start 20 years ago should
[SPEAKER_00]: be done now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd highly recommend this study by John
McPartland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the endocannabinoid article
of the decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's John with his I Heart Anandamide
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was discovered in pigs, which was an
odd thing to have happen in Israel,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll let Rafi tell that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But John reviewed the literature and
showed all these other disorders that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been linked to possible endocannabinoid
deficiency states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, read that one when you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need additional clinical studies of
irritable bowel, fibromyalgia and
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully to look at serum or even CSF
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great if we have better
physiological skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scans of the brain to show cannabinoid
density or real-time anandamide levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like Kevin and his crew to look
for common genetic markers of
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid regulation and disc
control, and I think we'll have some
[SPEAKER_00]: better answers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we need the clinical
studies, hopefully with enriched designs
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce the placebo effect, which is a
huge problem in these studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll let you take a quick look at this
quote from the original article.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got many disorders that cannabis
treats where nothing else does,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a lesson there that needs to
be heeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, let's keep in mind that the
endocannabinoid system can be regulated a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of different ways, with drugs,
with herbs beyond cannabis, with diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: with exercise, and hopefully this will
lead to better health for us all in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
