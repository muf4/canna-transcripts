[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, thanks for coming to the meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try in the next few minutes to
present an overall view of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: research as has been done in my laboratory
and in many other laboratories as well
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started work actually in the
1960s, there was essentially no major
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, I asked for a grant
and I was told when you have something
[SPEAKER_00]: more relevant to what's going on,
contact us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it turned out that cannabis was
relevant and indeed over the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years it has become so relevant that most
of the major journals have numerous
[SPEAKER_00]: articles and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thus, Nature last year had four reviews on
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that various
cannabinoids have turned out to be of
[SPEAKER_00]: major interest in many diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, two researchers at
NIH, Dr. Kunos and Dr. Pacher,
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote a review in which they mentioned
that the cannabinoid system is involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: most human diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a very strong statement,
but it seems to be correct and they give a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's probably the major reason why
so many people, so many journals,
[SPEAKER_00]: so many companies are interested in
cannabinoids today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me start back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids as medicine, cannabinoids as
drugs have been used for thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Assyria, they were used apparently for
neurological diseases, but over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: it was used in many other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Queen Victoria, for example, had cannabis
brought to her from India for the
[SPEAKER_00]: migraines she suffered from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this went on for a few thousand years
until, because of legal reasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis was taken of the various
pharmacopoeias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, nowadays it is coming
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is due to a large extent to the
research being done over many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many years now by many, many groups and a
few companies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me try to tell you where we stand
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that we have passed through
three stages of cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research in the 60s and 70s,
at least in our laboratories, was mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plant cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, the major active
cannabinoid, psychoactive cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: had not been isolated in pure form,
although some very good groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in the US and the UK, had worked in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is due to the huge mixture of
compounds that today we know are present
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was difficult at that time to isolate
pure compounds from such a mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the 60s, we were able to isolate
the active psychoactive material,
[SPEAKER_00]: delta-98.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to identify it, to elucidate its
structure, and then to synthesize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this compound, of course,
has been the object of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: papers, but there are also many additional
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We isolated about a dozen, and here are
some of the compounds you can see on the
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are quite a few others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we know that there are about 120
natural plant cannabinoids, most of them
[SPEAKER_00]: present in very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major compounds are, as I said,
THC, tetrahydrocannabinoid, and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidoil, which is not psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, neither THC, no CBD,
are produced by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant produces cannabidiolic acid and
THC acid, which you can see on the next
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these compounds decarboxylate and form
CBD and THC while they're still on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or in the cannabis mixture which has
been extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as these two compounds are not stable,
very little work has been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, we were able to stabilize these
compounds by making them into their methyl
[SPEAKER_00]: esters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that these compounds are
actually pretty potent compounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with colleagues in the UK,
in Canada, in Italy, in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that these compounds are
anti-anxiety compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that these compounds lower nausea
and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that these compounds will be
investigated further over many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I go ahead with the plant
cannabinoids, I want to mention that the
[SPEAKER_00]: activity is actually not the same in all
extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which seem to have the same amount of the
psychoactive material of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of the compounds present in
the mixture affect the effects that we see
[SPEAKER_00]: from THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this we call the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the effects of THC are affected by
the other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entourage compounds, but not all
effects are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to undertake or to go ahead
with a lot of research in order to find
[SPEAKER_00]: out where and how the entourage effect
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go and look at the effects of
THC, which are well-known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will not go into details.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that THC, in addition to its
psychoactivity, blocks vomiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it is quite effective in
treating post-trauma patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in letting them sleep better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-trauma patients have many problems
sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are quite a few other
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the reasons why people
use THC in the cannabis mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the last few years, it has been
found that the medicinal value of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably mostly due to cannabidiol,
a compound which was isolated in the 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We elucidated its structure in the 60s and
looked at some of its pharmacological and
[SPEAKER_00]: its clinical effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the last decade, there has been a
huge amount of work on cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we seem to know quite a bit on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just mention a few of the effects
that we know about cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first effects we looked at was
the effect of cannabidiol and epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done in collaboration with a
South American group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first, of course, looked into models of
epilepsy in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that it is very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did a clinical trial,
and that was 35 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that in adult patients,
about 12 adult patients we had,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a double-blind study, we saw that it is
very effective in patients that were
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with anti-epileptic drugs,
but they were not showing any improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that in four of the eight
patients that got cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had no attacks whatsoever for a few
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of them had just a few, and only one
was not affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, these results were not
taken up by the medical profession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for nearly 30 years, nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, a lot of children could
have been helped, but they had to wait
[SPEAKER_00]: until many parents found that cannabis
with a lot of cannabidiol helps their
[SPEAKER_00]: children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am glad to see the today compound
mixture and extract from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which contains essentially only
cannabidiol, Epidiolex, has been tested in
[SPEAKER_00]: epileptic children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results show that our small trial,
35 years ago, was correct, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol helps in epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Israel, there are about 100 children
that get cannabidiol, actually a mixture
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabidiol and THC, in a ratio of 22%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are helped by this extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epilepsy, as you know, may be a terrible
disease, especially in children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may stop their development,
and it ruins the child.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may ruin the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another aspect that has been looked into
in Israel is graft-versus-host disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a kind of an autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Namely, if the bone marrow in cancer
patients has to be replaced by bone marrow
[SPEAKER_00]: from outside, the body attacks the bone
marrow, the bone marrow attacks the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the person may be quite ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was found by a group of
clinicians in one of the hospitals in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel that cannabidiol can lower,
prevent, help with graft-versus-host
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is now being developed by a
commercial company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that it will become a drug against
graft-versus-host disease in the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are quite a few other cannabis there
are quite a few other diseases that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are still in the preclinical
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are, for example, quite a few
diseases in which the body attacks itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: autoimmune diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, diabetes type 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that in a model, which is quite
relevant to the human disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found that cannabidiol is very helpful
in diabetes type 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a disease in which the body
attacks the cells that produce insulin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the body does not have enough of
insulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually one sees that in children,
starting with children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that cannabidiol is very
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, nobody has tried this on
human patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this was essentially a summary,
a few words on the work that was done on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since then, research has moved into a
second direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant cannabinoids were thoroughly
investigated for nearly 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the 60s till the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to know a lot about their
chemistry, pharmacology, physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing was not known, and it was the
mode of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the 80s, a group in St. Louis,
Dr. Howlett found that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor, a specific receptor for the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the main mode of action of
cannabinoids, or particularly of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: acting through a receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she called this receptor cannabinoid
receptor number 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later a second receptor was found.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first receptor, cannabinoid receptor
number 1, or CB1, causes the well-known
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stimulation of CB2 does not cause all
these effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it is a kind of immune mode of
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps the immune system in various
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And THC binds to both CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabidiol does not bind essentially to
either CB1 or CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, receptors don't exist in our body
because they have to be activated by plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exist because they have to be
stimulated or suppressed by compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: we produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the 80s, late 80s, early 90s,
we started looking for the endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that stimulate these receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, in 1990, 1992, and then in
1995, we found two endogenous compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: made in our body, in the brain and the
periphery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these compounds we called anandamide,
one of them and the other one is called
[SPEAKER_00]: 2AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: These compounds are chemically completely
different from the plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: although they act essentially in the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They act as THC, except that there are
enzymes in the body that break them down
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as they have acted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while THC stays for quite some time in
the body, these compounds are formed when
[SPEAKER_00]: and where needed, and then they are broken
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do not see many of the effects that
we know with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not speak about the biochemistry of
these compounds, except for one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, they are not in the body until
they are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are formed when needed, then they
pass from one part of the synapse to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other part of the synapse, and there they
activate the receptor and affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: production or affect the action of many of
the neurotransmitters that we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the modes of action of
these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition, they have actions of
their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the second stage of
cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I search as I see it, there has been a
lot of work on an anandamide as a
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been a lot of work on 2AG,
and together with a collaborator at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hebrew University, Professor Esti Shohami,
we looked at the effect of 2AG in brain
[SPEAKER_00]: trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that in brain trauma, 2AG goes into
brain trauma and its concentration goes up
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, is that because the brain
has been damaged and does things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: not needed, or it is an actual reaction of
the brain to the trauma, trying to lower
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect of the trauma?
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we caused damage to the brain
of mice, and we looked at the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2AG, and we found that 2AG indeed lowers
the effects of the trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is probably one of the main
reasons for its production after the
[SPEAKER_00]: trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: These compounds have a lot of other
effects, and I will try to say a few words
[SPEAKER_00]: about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been found, for example,
that stimulation of CB2 has very positive
[SPEAKER_00]: effects in diseases of the heart,
in atherosclerosis, in quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: effects that have to do with inflammation,
rheumatoid arthritis, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been found to affect
neurodegenerative diseases, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we well know, it has effects on pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, these effects have not been
looked totally in human patients with pure
[SPEAKER_00]: 2AG or compounds that act on the CB2
receptor alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, as I said previously,
the CB1 receptor has to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactivity, quite a few other things,
but it has to do with the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CB2 does not have to do anything with
the psychoactivity, so we can have an
[SPEAKER_00]: opening to new drugs, drugs that act on
the CB2 alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although such compounds are well
known, we have synthesized several of
[SPEAKER_00]: these, quite a few others are well known,
they have not been introduced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have no idea why, because here we
have an opening, these compounds are
[SPEAKER_00]: normally not toxic, they have very
positive effects, and I hope that within
[SPEAKER_00]: the next few years we shall see drugs
based on specific activity on CB2,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm aware that a few companies are
working on specific CB2 agonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want to go to the third stage of
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that some of the actions of
cannabis extracts cannot be fully
[SPEAKER_00]: explained by the plant cannabinoids,
and so we thought that maybe there are
[SPEAKER_00]: additional compounds present in the plant,
present in our body, that have to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical effects or the clinical
effects we are seeing in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one of the effects that we looked into
was vasodilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that on brain trauma, some of the
blood vessels are vasor-restricted,
[SPEAKER_00]: not enough blood goes to some places in
the brain, and cannabis definitely affects
[SPEAKER_00]: this vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could not be explained fully with
anandamide and 2 AG, so we went ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for a compound of compounds that
act on this vasodilation, and indeed we
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered that a compound very closely
related to anandamide acts and causes,
[SPEAKER_00]: affects the vasoconstriction, and it is a
vasodilator, and the compound is really
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially of the same type as
anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anandamide is a fatty acid called
tarachidonic acid bound to ethanolamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have tarachidonic acid bound to an
amino acid, and so we went ahead looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for activity of this type of compounds,
and this I believe is now the third stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our body produces more than 100 compounds
of this sort, fatty acids bound to an
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these compounds we know very little
about their activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe that the body synthesizes
them just for the fun of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most probably it has something to do with
specific effects in the body, so we went
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead looking for the activity of these
compounds, and this research was always
[SPEAKER_00]: done in collaboration with biologists and
in specific fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: One effect which we found to be due to
compounds close to anandamide is bone
[SPEAKER_00]: remodeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was well known that women in the
Mediterranean region have less
[SPEAKER_00]: osteoporosis than women in Northern
Europe, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suggestion was made that olive oil has
to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women in the Mediterranean region consume
more olive oil than women in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe in the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of olive oil being used in
Israel and other countries around the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mediterranean region, and is it possible
that people say that it is the olive oil
[SPEAKER_00]: that has to do with the lower osteoporosis
that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead looking for the compound
that causes this effect, and this was done
[SPEAKER_00]: in collaboration with the late Professor
Bab, who did all the work both in vitro
[SPEAKER_00]: and in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that there is a compound
produced in the body, and which is closely
[SPEAKER_00]: related to anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This compound is indeed a derivative of
oleic acid, and when we found the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, synthesized it, and when this
compound was administered to mice that had
[SPEAKER_00]: osteoporosis, and we had a model for
osteoporosis in mice, we found that yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: indeed, it helps build the bones back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the slide that I'm showing
at the present that a few months after
[SPEAKER_00]: under certain conditions, mice develop
osteoporosis, and you can see that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: red on the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start giving them the compound we
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oleicid serine, we found that this
compound not only blocks further
[SPEAKER_00]: destruction, but it also helps with the
bone structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bone is being formed again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this effect may have very,
very high clinical importance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and indeed a company is developing a
compound based on oleicid serine,
[SPEAKER_00]: a derivative, and I hope that it will
become a drug within the next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last few months, we have been
working on addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We means a group of four research groups
in addition to ours, a group in Richmond,
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia, a group in Canada, and a group
in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sat together at one of the meetings,
discussed the possibility that addiction
[SPEAKER_00]: being a disease which causes changes in
our body, in our brain, this disease
[SPEAKER_00]: probably can be treated after our body
tries to prevent disease, our body tries
[SPEAKER_00]: to fight against disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible that in addiction,
our body tries to prevent addiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: tries to lower the effects of addiction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that this is definitely so.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a publication that a person who
was strongly addicted to smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarettes, to nicotine, when he was
involved in a traffic accident that caused
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to a certain part of his brain,
he stopped being addicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought that this is a good starting
point to see how we can affect addiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we tried this in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took mice, caused damage to that
particular part of the brain, insula
[SPEAKER_00]: called, and we looked at the changes
taking place there in the insula,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we found that the insula, after
damage, starts producing a compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: a nanomite-related compound, which was
possible to isolate, identify,
[SPEAKER_00]: elucidate the structure, and synthesize,
it turned out to be oleoglycine,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, a fatty acid bound to an amino
acid, very closely related to a nanomite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this compound, oleoglycine,
was administered to mice, and it prevented
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction to mice, and it prevented
withdrawal, withdrawal symptoms of both
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine addiction and opiate addiction,
again, in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not prevent the addiction to,
formation of addiction to heroin or to
[SPEAKER_00]: morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know now there are different types
of different ways our body reacts to
[SPEAKER_00]: addictions, and so we have to look for
maybe additional compounds that will act
[SPEAKER_00]: on cocaine addiction or that may act on
opiate addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we know for the first time,
I believe, that there are compounds formed
[SPEAKER_00]: in our body which work, in this case,
at least against
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we believe that many of the other
compounds that are found of the same type,
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the other compounds have
activities, and we have to find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: these activities are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to summarize what I said in a
few words.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, research on cannabinoids was,
obviously, on the plant cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: we learned a lot about THC, cannabidiol,
and the acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second stage was on the endogenous
cannabinoids, anandamide, N2AG,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are of major importance in our
metabolism and in probably the effect our
[SPEAKER_00]: body, or the way our body tries to lower
or prevent disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third phase is the formation in
our body of a huge number of compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: many of which seem to be of major
importance in various diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that we shall continue research on
the cannabinoids, and I'm glad to see that
[SPEAKER_00]: so many people are interested in this
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
