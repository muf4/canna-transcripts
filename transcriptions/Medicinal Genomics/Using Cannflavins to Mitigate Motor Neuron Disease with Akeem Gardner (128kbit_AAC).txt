[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis conference, check out the link in
the show description.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our marketing team put together a great
blog that highlights all the ways that
[SPEAKER_02]: CanMed is unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest today is Akeem Gardner,
who at CanMed 24 will present Effect of
[SPEAKER_02]: CanFlavins on Mitigating Motor Neuron
Disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Akeem is the founder and CEO of Canerda.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is an innovative entrepreneur with over
five years of experience in industrial
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp enterprises.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a proven track record in leading
high-performance teams that work across
[SPEAKER_02]: multi-channel platforms and strategically
aligning profitability with sustainability
[SPEAKER_02]: and economic development in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: During our conversation, we discuss the
minor molecules found in cannabis that
[SPEAKER_02]: Canerda is investigating for therapeutics,
Canerda's process for evaluating
[SPEAKER_02]: indications for CanFlavins and
polyphenols, how the diverse molecules in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis make it a great therapeutic for a
multifactorial disease like ALS,
[SPEAKER_02]: the potential for CanFlavins and
polyphenols to be used as an
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-inflammatory nutraceutical and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation with
Akeem, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, the American Cannabis Nurses
Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: ACNA is a national nursing organization
whose mission is to advance excellence in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis nursing practice through
advocacy, collaboration, education,
[SPEAKER_02]: research, and policy development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Founded in 2010, ACNA continues to work on
providing their members with up-to-date
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis information and resources to care
for patients who use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Join them today at cannabisnurses.org and
be part of the change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Akeem
[SPEAKER_02]: Gardner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Akeem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me here, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excited to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to CanMed 2024 as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it is great to have you back on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you mentioned, you're returning for
CanMed 24.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did give a great presentation at
CanMed 23 about the researcher team
[SPEAKER_02]: performed on using CanFlavins to treat
glioblastoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll put a link in the show
description so people can check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we said, you're coming back again
this year to share data related to how
[SPEAKER_02]: CanFlavins, again, may help treat patients
with motor neuron disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we dive into that, I was
checking out your website at canerda.com
[SPEAKER_02]: before we jumped on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like there's a lot of
activity going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you catch us up on what
you've been working on since last we
[SPEAKER_02]: spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we are very, very busy
bees up here in Toronto doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: research on these minor molecules found in
the CanFlavins plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only the CanFlavins, but other
penylated flavonoids, still beans for
[SPEAKER_00]: benzyles, but are there in cannabis and
industrial hemp as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, and as we know with all
botanicals, with the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these molecules, they have
multi-targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work on different aspects of the body
to do different things in various
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the last year, we've been really,
really trying to narrow down in on our
[SPEAKER_00]: research on the applications of what these
molecules and ingredients can do on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own and in different combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you actually get products out
of these botanical, botanical drug
[SPEAKER_00]: candidates, but also nutraceuticals that
can go to the market much sooner and help
[SPEAKER_00]: people out in a quicker, in a quicker
period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I heard you mentioned there's some
additional molecules that you're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at because last time we, we, we focused on
the CanFlavins A and B last we spoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious what these, what these new
molecules are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, but I can't remember if I said
it last time, probably didn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at Conerta, we really want to be the
company that you go to when you think
[SPEAKER_00]: anything cannabis hemp polyphenol related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these polyphenols and in minor
concentrations in the plant, so there are
[SPEAKER_00]: groups of penylated flavonoids,
which will include the CanFlavin A,
[SPEAKER_00]: CanFlavin B and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would include still beans, verbenzyles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verbenzyles are ingredients like canapren,
cannabis still bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still beans, verbenzyles and other
ingredients as well that have yet to be
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: All in all, I think there's about seven or
eight molecules that have been identified
[SPEAKER_00]: in literature, but there's no validated
standards to be able to identify these at
[SPEAKER_00]: a consistent basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very, very small and very,
very small concentrations in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are working on multiple ways of
enriching extracts for these ingredients,
[SPEAKER_00]: then being able to isolate them,
purify them, and then test them all out
[SPEAKER_00]: for their bioactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when we're putting combinations
together, we're sure we can be,
[SPEAKER_00]: or make better guesses or hypothesis,
hypothesis about what these ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: can do when it comes to treating both
humans and animals in a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different health conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you say small concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: How small are we talking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we look at the CanFlavin,
the lead ones, these ones are the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can get most reliably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these ones are found in under 0.014%
of the plant's biomass on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really have to, and the first patent
that we designed, or the researchers at
[SPEAKER_00]: the university designed, was a way of
specifically concentrating, then
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying isolating, and then purifying
all of these molecules so that when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing HPLC or NMR or whatnot aspect,
we actually know what's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can identify the various molecules that
are there, and then we can develop
[SPEAKER_00]: standards for these molecules with our
biosynthesis technology as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the plant making such small
concentrations, is that the best way to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce these molecules, or do you have
some other sort of process for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the best way for us to get these
molecules right now is extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of our extraction process is
it's a commercially feasible way of,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, concentrating, isolating,
and purifying so that we can get these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, there may be another way
that we come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of other methods under
investigation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, like I said, this is what we
ultimately want to be known at,
[SPEAKER_00]: known for at Kinerda, being the ones that
can get these molecules in a reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion at the standards or at the level
of what the characterization that the FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: or any other regulator around the world
wants for botanical ingredients,
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical API.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and I know a big part of what you do
at Kinerda is you investigate different
[SPEAKER_02]: indications that might be a good target
for these molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, like I said, I was looking at
the website and there it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of different things you're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious, how do you decide which
conditions you want to investigate?
[SPEAKER_02]: And sort of what's your process for sort
of evaluating these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as a halfway joke, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Partly ask chat GPT, we'd have these
molecules, they have these sort of inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: and activity, how might they be able to
help, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a halfway joke, because we do use
AI and bioinformaticians to help screen
[SPEAKER_00]: our molecules and give us information for
where we think this might be most
[SPEAKER_00]: applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we know that our
ingredients do very well is they target
[SPEAKER_00]: the inflammatory related pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that chronic inflammation,
systematic chronic inflammation is related
[SPEAKER_00]: to a wide variety of diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually everything starts as that slow
burning continuous inflammation goes
[SPEAKER_00]: undetected, then it can turn into cancer,
to know degenerative problems and to
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiovascular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where problems so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we start is we look at,
okay, what areas of disease or what other
[SPEAKER_00]: indications are related to A,
inflammation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if inflammation isn't the primary
driver of that disease, do our molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: hit other targets that are related to that
disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in our cancer program,
we found that our molecules also hit
[SPEAKER_00]: TREP-B, so that we were able to go down
that pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then really what I try to do is I try
to find a key opinion leader, someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's used to doing the academic or
preclinical or discovery work required to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to validate the ideas,
the hypothesis that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Canada, we are very fortunate to
have a wide variety of universities with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of investigators with the government
programs that can fund student research so
[SPEAKER_00]: that professors with the oversight can
lead a PhD or a master's student or even
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes undergrad students to do a
series of experiments for us, proof of
[SPEAKER_00]: concept experiments for us, that will give
us the information we need to deductively
[SPEAKER_00]: reason and say, yes, this is what we wanna
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this is where we think we have the
highest chance of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can turn this around in a reasonable
time because from this batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments and work previously done,
we can fast track this into the clinic,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we're trying to do with our first
asset, our lead asset for motor neuron
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, ALS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, okay, so that was gonna be sort of
my next question is, which one of these
[SPEAKER_02]: indications is sort of the furthest along
or closest to actually doing clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: trials?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like it's this ALS motor
neuron application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Motor neuron disease, I think so,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last year, we've learned a lot
about ALS motor neuron disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned a lot about how the cannabis
plant has helped people suffering from
[SPEAKER_00]: neurological ailments since the beginning
of time in a variety of different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, leaning on the experience of
Dr. Ethan Russo, our senior medical
[SPEAKER_00]: advisor, and what the work that they did
formally at GW Pharma, we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can help in severe neurological
diseases, neurodegenerative diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ALS motor neuron disease is an area
where these patients, they need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them use cannabis right now to
help manage their symptoms, but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have something standardized and the
practitioner doesn't always know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient is using, even though they can
come into the clinic and say, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using cannabis, we feel better,
we're eating more, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal is to be able to leverage all
the work previously done along with some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the new work that we're doing right now
to be able to move this forward into the
[SPEAKER_00]: clinic and really help a patient
population that's looking for answers,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's looking for help, that's looking
for a better quality of life and really
[SPEAKER_00]: deserves to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the therapeutic that you're sort
of evaluating, is that like a single
[SPEAKER_02]: molecule therapeutic or is it sort of a
combination of different compounds?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally speaking, when we evaluate
our assets and any indication,
[SPEAKER_00]: we put a series of different candidates in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will put like highly purified single
can flavin, can A, we'll put can A
[SPEAKER_00]: extract, and then we could put combination
extract in there and see what performs
[SPEAKER_00]: best based on the mixture, the cocktail
mixture, the almost entouraged or
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistic approach, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, based on the work previously done and
based on, again, being a student of Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rizzo, we know that in the clinic for
humans, it's probably not going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: single mixture, a single ingredient that
has the best opportunity to help these
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a cocktail mixture,
a cocktail approach, not dissimilar to how
[SPEAKER_00]: these patients are getting treated right
now, but we can talk about that a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was saying, we put together a series
of different molecules found in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: at various concentrations, at safe
concentrations that we believe can be
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered to patients chronically on an
everyday basis that can help them manage
[SPEAKER_00]: their symptoms, that can improve their
quality of life, and might also be
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotective as well and help them with
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that we have something that
can be disease modifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we just have to continue to go out and
improve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where are we at now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe let's, how about a little
preview?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want you to give away too much
because we want people to come out to the
[SPEAKER_02]: event, but what are you looking to present
at CanMed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at CanMed, we have a series of,
again, previous literature that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: done, but also some unique experiments
that we've recently done to validate that
[SPEAKER_00]: our combination actually does work how we
think it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to share some of
this information, share, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the process that we went through from
looking at all the things previously done
[SPEAKER_00]: to adding our unique twists on it and then
showing what the result is and how we got
[SPEAKER_00]: it to work in our favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you touched on it before when you
were talking about ALS, like what are sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of the therapeutics that ALS patients are
using now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, why is yours potentially a
better solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, I'll start first really quickly
with what is ALS, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ALS is a pretty severe
neurodegenerative disease, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in a variety of different forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really complex disorder where a lot
of things are going on, and people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really understand why patients get it,
why they, as soon as they get it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're two to three years, usually,
until mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually, when they get it,
they end up in a wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to have tubes to help with their
feeding, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really rapid progression and
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dehabilitating motor neuron disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, because of the complexity of
ALS, again, even though it was first
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered 150 years ago, there's no cure
to it still, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because of the complexity of
what's going on in the CNS and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: motor neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, most recently, and I think as of
today, there's four slash, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the torfacin becomes the fifth drug
that's approved for the treatment of this
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing about all these different
treatments is none of them extend survival
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningfully, none of them cure the
disease, none of them help manage the
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because ALS is so complex between
patient to patient, there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different gene irregularities and
different things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, practitioners, they sort of
describe to the patient in this cocktail
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, here, take all four treatments,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all four will maybe help you on your
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we aim to do instead of having to
have the patient have four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: different treatments to help them,
we aim to put all the benefits of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant and the various different
ingredients in the cannabis plant into a
[SPEAKER_00]: single or a monotherapy that they can take
on a day-to-day basis that will not only
[SPEAKER_00]: help them address their various different
symptoms, their pain, help them sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: better, help them with their hunger and
their appetite, help them with keeping on
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle mass, but also improve their
quality of life and then potentially be
[SPEAKER_00]: more protective as well and extend their
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think we have a sort of all-in-one
approach and this is where we get to
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from the multiple applications of
the cannabis plant and all its various
[SPEAKER_00]: indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need one thing to do one thing
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're dealing with a complex disease
like ALS, you sort of need the
[SPEAKER_00]: polypharmalogical approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we get this advantage,
plus the added advantage of having our
[SPEAKER_00]: super pollen anti-inflammatories and our
chem flavins in this mixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and you mentioned, so the current
medications, they don't relieve symptoms,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't extend lifespan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was another thing you said
there that they're not doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what are they doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they help, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't cure, there's no cure for
ALS, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really understand what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, each of these medicines,
they're designed to specifically do one or
[SPEAKER_00]: another thing, help with patient
sub-populations of ALS patients that have
[SPEAKER_00]: one disease modification off or another,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't help in broad spectrum,
if you recall, to the broader population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them, none of them address the
symptoms like we know we can address the
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why ALS patients, even if they're
taking a medicine, one or the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll still often smoke cannabis or have
a tincture or have a topical or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that to be able to help them with the
symptoms that they're also suffering from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where, yeah, this is where we
think we can come in and we can really
[SPEAKER_00]: help because again, we know things like
cannabis helps with spasticity,
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps with muscle spasms, cramps,
the pain, the fatigue, depression,
[SPEAKER_00]: nausea, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that with cannabis,
you can have these benefits, have an
[SPEAKER_00]: improved quality of life without a host of
other adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sort of seems to kind of
illustrate, you know, the difference
[SPEAKER_02]: between cannabis medicine approach and a
traditional pharma approach, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like pharma is, is like you said,
typically focused on, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a single molecule for a single indication,
which it sounds like is what's being used
[SPEAKER_02]: for ALS now, but it's not really effective
because it is such a broad disease where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not sort of a one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where something like a cannabis
might actually be a better approach
[SPEAKER_02]: because it can help in so many different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be if you can deliver it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the CMC and the pharmaceutical
standard, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In pharma, they do do combination
therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, they still use the
cocktail approach for ALS.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have four approved diseases,
four approved medicines, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can help treat one aspect or another
of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they deliver it to get together
in the combination approach, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: easier way to get it approved because you
have to do the clinical trial,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have to have the CMC and be
able to produce it consistently every
[SPEAKER_00]: single time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to have one thing that does one thing
very well, get it to market and then let
[SPEAKER_00]: the practitioners prescribe or use it to
help their patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where, again, our learnings from
those that have done it before,
[SPEAKER_00]: those that have done it at the
pharmaceutical standard with Sativex and
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidiolytes, we get the benefit of
understanding how do you make this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make this happen with botanical
mixtures?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make this happen with cannabis
and how do you make it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you can do that from a production
weight, from a clinical trial weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a batch to batch repeatability rate,
then the patients get all the real
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits that cannabis can offer in a
standardized, consistent method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, the whole consistency thing,
that is one of the greatest challenges
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis medicine, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another, but another challenge with
cannabis medicine is, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious, and maybe it's way too
soon to tell, but how would the cost of
[SPEAKER_02]: this type of therapeutic sort of compare
to kind of the standard ALS treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a little bit soon to tell,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that's going to come after we
finish our full scale up, our CMC and have
[SPEAKER_00]: the cost of good souls.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, is once you get it
through the clinical trials, once you get
[SPEAKER_00]: it approved by regulators, then the
payers, the insurance will pay for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing about this is that it's
not just restricted to a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get it approved as a drug,
you can cross domestic lines and the big
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance companies can pay for it,
not only in the U.S., but also this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: approach that we'll take in targeting the
payers and getting the payers to approve
[SPEAKER_00]: reimbursement all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know you're up there in Canada,
which is a little bit different than the U
[SPEAKER_02]: .S., because you do have a federal medical
cannabis program up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the path to getting the payers to
reimburse or pay for this therapeutic,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it an easier path up there than the U
.S.?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably I'm not going to say easier
because, again, we're not going to go down
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical cannabis route to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going after pharmaceutical,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go the same route as traditional
pharmaceuticals like GW Pharmadid with
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidiox and Sativex to get full
reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not to say that we don't have a
fallback plan if we have to go to a
[SPEAKER_00]: fallback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always good to have a fallback plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we mentioned before that these are in
very low concentrations in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: At what sort of concentrations are these
compounds effective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a little goes a long way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, different dosages for
different indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our ALS formulation is a combination
of a variety of different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: including our Canflavin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the ALS formulation, we don't need a
lot of Canflavin A or B to work on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient because it's not working
alone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus another indication, we may want
more of it because the Canflavin might do
[SPEAKER_00]: something better than a terpene or another
cannabinoid for that exam, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the Canflavin might even just work
better all alone instead of in combination
[SPEAKER_00]: for a different type of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on what we're talking
about and who we're aiming to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also say it also depends on the
physical makeup of the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we have some of our extracts
right now, our pilot scale extracts that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not out in the market yet,
but I could see them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm 6 by 240.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom isn't 6 by 240.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where my mom takes one, one,
um, tincture, one droplet, one tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: full of our extract, I have to take two or
three to get equal therapeutic dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some of the complexities about
cannabis and about humans and about making
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals because all of us have
different genetic makeups, different
[SPEAKER_00]: physical makeups, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What works where one person might not work
for the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you may have to titrate up to
your dose, find your maximum tolerable
[SPEAKER_00]: dose and do what works for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's what, um, Bonnie Goldstein
and, uh, Dustin Sulak and Ethan Russo,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, uh, talk about, and they'll be
talking about again this year at the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical practicum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so you said that you, you take,
um, one of your extracts, um, daily,
[SPEAKER_02]: or is that just for kind of general
wellness or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for general wellness and I can't put
something on the market that I haven't put
[SPEAKER_00]: through the ringer myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my Husky Sky, we're Connerto 1.0
taste testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Sky loves it, if I'm okay, then I feel
good with everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I do take it right now for
general, for general wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, um, I'm currently our longest,
um, safety study, our long-term safety
[SPEAKER_00]: study, because I've been taking it since
day one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And wanted to make sure that again,
no stomach issues, no nausea, no adverse
[SPEAKER_00]: events, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel really, really fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I can say about our
extract, one of the things that I've come
[SPEAKER_00]: to found is, um, the other day I hurt my
back in the gym and it was a crazy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was deadlifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was deadlifting angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should never deadlift angry because
that's when injuries happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned it the hard way,
but it was very interesting because when I
[SPEAKER_00]: tweaked my, um, the muscle in my back,
um, I still had a range of motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I was hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt that I was hurt, but I can still
move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could still get through my workout
versus traditionally, um, or if I,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, traditionally I'll say my back would
lock up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that injury happened,
I remember the next day, the next two days
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taking my extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I was like, I slept okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My back didn't lock up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't super sore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, this is weird, but is this in my
head?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want our extract to work more
than anyone, but I'm like, I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: know I'm injured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, um, I remember me and my
mom, we were sharing a bottle at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I left the bottle at home and I went to
my fiance's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent the weekend at my fiance's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up Saturday morning and I hadn't
had the extract and I'm like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting to feel a little bit more
tightness in my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have my range of motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get in and out of my car,
stand up, sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the Sunday when I woke up,
my back was locked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is completely messed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe this is what my back was
going through this whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called my mom immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom, I'm coming home to take the rest of
the bottle right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get from the next batch because
there's no, like I couldn't, every time I
[SPEAKER_00]: was getting up, sitting down, it was so
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to like, you know, you know,
when you're injured and it's really tight,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd have to like slowly, but surely
bring yourself down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, no lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to take my extract again at the
usual dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, um, the next day,
the day after I was still hurt,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I had my range of motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get in and out of my car without
thinking twice about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is actually like really
illuminating because if, um, I'm 33 right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but we know that as people age,
as, um, they get more chronic ailments,
[SPEAKER_00]: more arthritics, so on and so forth,
that they're going through things like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that an extract like this can
really help, really help improve quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of life, really help them just manage the
symptoms of whatever they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, um, the first real time
where I was like, okay, I know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm seeing in the experience,
experiments, but now I actually felt it in
[SPEAKER_00]: my own body about the power of this
extract, the power of the enriched
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts and what it can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, so that's some power, powerful
anti-inflammatory there, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was definitely helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, ever since then, I'm like,
no mom, we have to wait for the second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to have a bottle with me at all
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so in, in kind of winding down here,
I did want to kind of check in with you
[SPEAKER_02]: too, cause we mentioned at the top that
you spoke last year about using canned
[SPEAKER_02]: flavons for a glial blastoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm wondering what's happened on that
front since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is that, is that also kind of moving
along?
[SPEAKER_02]: The, uh, um, the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slowly, but surely cancer is very
difficult and tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: ALS complex as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer even more, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're still continuing that project is
still going on at the university of
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually getting ready to do a
series of organoid studies and not only
[SPEAKER_00]: for glial blastoma, breast cancer and
breast cancer metastasis studies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, we know that our molecules
have the track B activity plus their own
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are still being done at a
pre-clinical phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge that you're going to have
right now is I really need key opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: leaders and people who can help us do the
work at the next phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a practitioner and doctor,
a practicing doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a principal investigator in the
traditional, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really for us, uh, the next phase of
work that we need to do one, once these
[SPEAKER_00]: sets of experiments are complete is
finding someone who's interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at, uh, future alternatives to
cancer treatments, small molecule cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments, and taking a look at the data
that we have been having the experience
[SPEAKER_00]: and the know how to be able to help us
take this forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some, we have, you know,
we have some ideas about, about,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, other areas of cancer that we might be
able to help him like things like cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, which are inflammation related.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to things like again,
brain cancer, um, breast cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: we really need people, um, from the
community from out there in the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world to help us move those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I do know of an event that's
happening in May where there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, clinicians, uh, who might be able to
help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a hundred percent for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, all the feedback and the people
that I met at CanMed were awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and a lot of interesting leads that I
am very excited to follow up on this year
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to show, okay, now we know that
we can actually do X, Y, and Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now can we actually, and we can actually
produce more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are the next steps to actually
getting this one step further down the
[SPEAKER_00]: line?
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to foster those relationships for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, I do actually want to circle back
about, you know, your story about sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: using the extract as a, as an
anti-inflammatory and sort of as almost
[SPEAKER_02]: like a preventative or general wellness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is that another line that you're
pursuing as well as, um, sort of making
[SPEAKER_02]: this available to, uh, to folks to,
to take regularly or when they deadlift
[SPEAKER_02]: angry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this year, um, sometime
between Q2 and Q3, we will have an extract
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for launch in the U S markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a group that we've been working
with in Oregon, shout out to F Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they, we've been able to transfer our
technology to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been working on scaling it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now we're at the last step on making
sure that, um, our excipients,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, our excipients and our ingredients
stays in excipients in the carrier oil
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have our bottling and our labeling
and all worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will be launching this in an
e-commerce type of a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very, very soon we're right around the
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a high concentration,
can't blab in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, extract product, but it is an enriched
polyphenol product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The camp labins are in it in more of an
amount than any other product that's on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market as of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not at our full botanical drug
characterization level yet, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be as a nutraceutical and as a
health and wellness product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, again, the most important thing
is going to be getting this into the hands
[SPEAKER_00]: of people who need it the most,
allowing these ingredients to start to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into their, um, daily consumption
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, allowed to start to accumulate in the
body and do what it does well,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it be at a more of a nutraceutical
health and wellness every day level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those suffering more from severe
chronic disorders, we'll continue to do
[SPEAKER_00]: our clinical trial research, our batch to
batch production and our scale up so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can serve them as soon as possible
thereafter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, I, I personally, I take CBDA
every day or after all my workouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be definitely, definitely be
interested in checking out your products
[SPEAKER_02]: once they're out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, all right, Akim winding down here,
I did want to give you an opportunity to,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, plug any additional resources that you
think the listeners might be interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: learning more about the, the topics we've
been talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, uh, your website,
social media, anything like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: please plug away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for anyone who's interested in learning
more, always feel free to reach out to me
[SPEAKER_00]: on LinkedIn or on my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just akim at crinerta.com on our
website in our journal area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crinerta.com backslash journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bunch of different resources
there, including, um, um, new literature
[SPEAKER_00]: or new data as it comes about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we look to post it there and it
usually goes on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would ultimately say is to come
to Can Med 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can Med 2024 was a very important for me
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning about where the state of
cannabis research is meeting all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different key people, leaders,
and the peace people who are treating the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients suffering from a variety of
different things of cannabis and also
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing us to tell our story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was very happy to be able to get on
that stage for the first time last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really excited to follow that on with,
um, more actionable items this year and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to grow our relationship with the
whole Can Med community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we appreciate you, Akim, and look
forward to seeing you down in Marco
[SPEAKER_02]: Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very, very much for having me

cold and wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're up in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not much warmer where we are,
but we'll do our best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm as well.
