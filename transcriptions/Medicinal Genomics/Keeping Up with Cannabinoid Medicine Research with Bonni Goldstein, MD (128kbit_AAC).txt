[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, on behalf of Medicinal Genomics and
CanMed events, I hope you all had a safe
[SPEAKER_00]: and happy holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we wind down 2023, be sure to take
advantage of our early bird pricing for
[SPEAKER_00]: the CanMed 24 Innovation and Investment
Summit, taking place this May in Marco
[SPEAKER_00]: Island, Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: That early bird pricing is available
through the remainder of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so be sure to get your ticket before the
ball drops in Times Square.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate your support for CanMed,
whether it's listening to the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: following us on social media, viewing the
presentation videos in the CanMed archive,
[SPEAKER_00]: or joining us for the annual summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's truly an honor to provide a platform
for the brilliant clinicians and
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers that participate in CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work they do is transforming the
industry and bringing hope to many who
[SPEAKER_00]: suffer from disease and illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today's guest is a great example of
one of those clinicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnie Goldstein is one of the country's
most respected and experienced medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis physicians, having treated
thousands of patients with medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the owner and medical director of
Canna Center's Wellness and Education.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the clinical advisor to
Canformatics, and she is the author of the
[SPEAKER_00]: book titled, Cannabis is Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How medical cannabis and CBD are healing
everything from anxiety to chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnie has participated in every CanMed
event since we started in 2016,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she leads the CanMed medical practicum
again this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we talked about
what attendees can expect from the CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: medical practicum, new research that she
is excited about concerning THC-A and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD-A, Bonnie's method for customizing
cannabinoid formulations for her patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: the many barriers preventing patients from
using medical cannabis, how the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid medicine options have expanded
over the last decade, and the difficulty
[SPEAKER_00]: of keeping up with the cannabis medicine
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Bonnie, I would like to thank this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's sponsor, the Dent Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: With more than 300,000 patient visits per
year, the Dent Neurologic Institute ranks
[SPEAKER_00]: among the largest neuroscience centers in
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its 24 subspecialty clinics often treat
the most challenging neurologic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, including, but not limited to,
migraine, chronic pain, ALS, MS,
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's, dementia, and neuro-oncology.
[SPEAKER_00]: With their mission of advancing
neuroscience, the Dent Institute
[SPEAKER_00]: established a cannabis clinic in 2016 to
aid in the treatment of these chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions seen throughout the Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information, visit
thedentinstitute.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnie Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for having me again,
Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thrilled to have you coming back for
CanMed 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was watching your CanMed 23
presentation before we jumped on the call
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the start, you mentioned how much
you love the location and how you think it
[SPEAKER_00]: should, that CanMed should be at that
location every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got your wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going back to Marco Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marco Island for CanMed 24.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, there was this,
not only was the location gorgeous,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it's my screensaver on my phone
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a picture of the sunset on the
beach and it was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the camaraderie, the kind of upbeat
nature of everybody that was there,
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to learn, to share, just excited
to be around other people who kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: understand cannabis and are excited about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, but like so,
you know, I'm living in the medical world,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's only so much bandwidth I have
to expand into learning everything about
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet I attend the lectures from these
brilliant PhDs in plant biology and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned so much and it just enhances
the whole, my whole ability to really
[SPEAKER_02]: understand everything about the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's a great conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've said that, in fact, the day that
I went to leave, I, you know, talked to
[SPEAKER_02]: the organizers and just said, spectacular
from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really encourage people to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really, if you're only can go to
one conference, this is the conference to
[SPEAKER_02]: go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hoping to have more
opportunities for some of that camaraderie
[SPEAKER_00]: and networking that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really excited about this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, one of the pillars of the
event is the medical practicum,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to be taking place on
Monday, the 13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a full day workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really sort of a crash course in
cannabinoid medicine featuring you,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, Dr. Dustin Sulak, Eloise
Thiessen, and new this year, Dr. Ethan
[SPEAKER_00]: Rousseau, which is quite the lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping briefly, can you tell the
listeners what they can expect from the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical practicum?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we at the medical practicum break it
down into kind of two parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one is the basic science that you need
to understand, kind of like the first two
[SPEAKER_02]: years of medical school, where they teach
you all the biochemistry and physiology
[SPEAKER_02]: and you don't really get into the patient
care just yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the morning lectures,
which are about the physiology of the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system, the pharmacology
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we move into dosing, how to
approach a patient, which cannabinoids you
[SPEAKER_02]: might want to choose for which conditions
or which symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we share our clinical experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And listen, we know that we're behind in
research because of the prohibition,
[SPEAKER_02]: the schedule one status that is ongoing,
still not allowed to do studies on THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you jump through a thousand hoops
with the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: So although it's getting a little bit
better, what we have in our arsenal is our
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis is not the same as
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's multiple compounds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't fit that, you know,
single molecule and where you can do a
[SPEAKER_02]: randomized controlled trial, it just
doesn't fit into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And although those trials are helpful,
I feel found that clinically, because
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is so safe, if you just
understand what you're doing and learn
[SPEAKER_02]: from people who have been doing it,
you can actually make a difference in
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody's life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody who's suffering from a refractory
condition or somebody where the treatment
[SPEAKER_02]: is almost worse than the symptoms of the
condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and even then, not just those
kinds of patients, but just general
[SPEAKER_02]: wellness for your patients to keep them
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it's a really, it's a
powerhouse of a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of learning and we make
ourselves available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ethan, Dustin, myself, and Eloise all
have, oh gosh, I don't even know how many
[SPEAKER_02]: years, if you put it together,
experience in cannabis medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a lot, but you have the ability to
pick our brains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we hear about
all the time is the fact that people can
[SPEAKER_00]: walk up to you or have a meal with you
and, you know, just continue to pick your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain and learn even beyond just the
sessions is such a great part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the point that you made too
about the practicum is that you start off
[SPEAKER_00]: with the basics, which, you know,
even if you're, if you're new to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're dipping your toe, it's a great
place to start and gives you a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation for the following day too,
where it gets into sort of more,
[SPEAKER_00]: more detailed research that the oral
presenters are giving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you attend the practicum, it gives you
a nice, kind of solid foundation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we're, I hate to say it,
but we're all kind of like nerds,
[SPEAKER_02]: science nerds, and we've focused on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you come up to me and I'm eating
lunch and you say, Hey, can I pick your
[SPEAKER_02]: brain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like all in, you know, let's go for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love sharing what I know because,
you know, I would joke around,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't take care of everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need other clinicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need other, even if it's not the first
line treatment like it is, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not first line in my practice because
I'm seeing people after they've already
[SPEAKER_02]: failed first, second, and third line,
but it's something that you should be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to discuss with your patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need to have that basic knowledge
to have that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe there are some listeners out
there who have already attended CanMed,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even already attended the practicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that the research is constantly
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: New things are always coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are there new things in this year's
practicum that you wanted to highlight
[SPEAKER_00]: that people should consider if they're
thinking about coming back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we are spending a little bit more
time on the clinical side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have the basic science lectures,
but we are, you know, trying to add more
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So case reports and Dr. Ethan Russo is
doing a lecture highlighting neurologic
[SPEAKER_02]: disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a neurologist by training.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's so brilliant that he is able to
impart that knowledge about how so many
[SPEAKER_02]: neurologic disorders like dementia,
let's say, certain brain cancers,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we really don't have good treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, your loved one gets diagnosed,
dementia goes to the neurologist and they
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of hand you some medications that
don't really do great things, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe slight improvement, but certainly
not in everybody and lots of side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's going to go through how
cannabinoids can be preventive and also
[SPEAKER_02]: can be provide a really great treatment
for people struggling with neurologic
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited to hear that
lecture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard parts of it in the past,
but I can't wait to hear him talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's always exciting to get to hear
Dr. Russo talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's sort of the sort of the elder
statesman, not to not to date him,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the guru.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my guru.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's he's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're talking about new literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming out all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I was watching your
camera 23 presentation and you even
[SPEAKER_00]: remarked that that morning you had to add
some new information into your
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation because you were you were
looking at a paper and realized,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I need to put that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literature is changing all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: New research all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any new developments,
new research recently that you're excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, kind of touching on that dementia
part of it, a paper came out very recently
[SPEAKER_02]: and I guess it's in mice, but it gives us
some really nice information that we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't really have before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the raw cannabinoids, CBDA and THCA,
so cannabidiolic acid and
[SPEAKER_02]: tetrahydrocannabinolic acid are compounds
that the plant gives us in its unheated
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way back when, when I started doing this
in 2008, we actually thought that these
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds were inactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was taught so you have to heat the
plant in order to activate the medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: properties, kind of like convert CBDA to
CBD, convert THCA to THC through that
[SPEAKER_02]: heating process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, we find out that that's not
true.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDA and THCA have potent
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: neuroprotective effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's been a tremendous amount of
research looking at these, what we call
[SPEAKER_02]: the acidic cannabinoids, that A at the end
stands for the acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what can they do?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are woefully understudied,
but luckily there's a lot of interest and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's moving forward in terms of the
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a recent study came out showing that
both CBDA and THCA in a mouse model of
[SPEAKER_02]: Alzheimer's was actually quite protective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it lowered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you get Alzheimer's or dementia,
what's happening is your brain cells are
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming inflamed and they're dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with Alzheimer's, particularly there's
these deposits of these proteins in your
[SPEAKER_02]: brain that kind of basically mess up cell
function.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out that CBDA and THCA in
mice that receive those compared to mice
[SPEAKER_02]: that didn't get those compounds actually
reduced or lowered those proteins
[SPEAKER_02]: deposition, which is amazing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we don't really have medicine to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also alleviated this abnormal calcium
flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcium is very important to your brain
function.
[SPEAKER_02]: It calcium moves in and out of your cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not because of how much milk you
drink or how much dairy you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it's really just how calcium flows in
and out of the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that becomes unregulated or out of
balance, you can have a lot of problems
[SPEAKER_02]: neurologically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so THCA and CBDA were found to
alleviate that imbalance, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also had other neuroprotective
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the study, they actually measured
memory loss and resilience to these
[SPEAKER_02]: changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mice that got these cannabinoids
did better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'll tell you just in my own
experience, I use CBDA and THCA all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time in my pediatric practice,
as well as my adult practice, mostly for
[SPEAKER_02]: alleviation of inflammation like let's say
related to osteoarthritis.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the pediatric patients, also many of my
patients have neuronal inflammation,
[SPEAKER_02]: neuroinflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, especially the kids with autism
have major dysfunction in their immune
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also CBDA and THCA appear to also help
with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another reason that we use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-impairing compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like plant, we don't have to worry
about going high dose and making somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: uncomfortably high or too much
psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly that's never the goal,
especially with the pediatric patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have this new data.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you mentioned that the prevailing
wisdom before was that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylate these compounds in order to
make them active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, was that sort of because it is true
that, and you made the point yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: that THCA is not psychoactive until you
decarboxylate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was the thought that, OK, if it's true
in that case, that it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive unless we decarboxylate it,
it's probably true for the other medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: effects too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I think that was kind of a
generalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you can't study things,
you can't learn about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people went by how they felt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were to take raw cannabis,
you don't feel anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing like with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you took some CBD and you say,
well, I don't feel anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe it's not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we know now is that not only do
these compounds just need a little time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but dosing matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should know what your dosing is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The preparation matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it actually what's in the bottle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly what's on the label, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that jive?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of my patients who are using
non-impering cannabinoids, so basically
[SPEAKER_02]: everything but THC and possibly CBN,
they report, well, I don't feel anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, we have to give it time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to hit you like a harsh
pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get you into homeostasis
over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: My analogy is if I'm out of shape and I go
to the gym tomorrow, I am not in shape
[SPEAKER_02]: tomorrow night.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I hang in there, I will see in a
month I feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: In two months, I feel even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by three months, people are saying,
wow, you've got muscles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, wow, you look great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to give cannabis a chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a plant that we're asking it to
change either your neurochemistry or your
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammatory chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to give it a chance to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll share with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of elderly patients that
have pretty severe pain from gout,
[SPEAKER_02]: from severe osteoarthritis, bone on bone
in their knees, or severe hip pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: other joint pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they report that CBDA is amazing for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no, I just have not seen side
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in my autism patients, sometimes
we're hitting targets that we might not
[SPEAKER_02]: want to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the children may have worse behaviors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very unique to that condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, CBDA seems to be very well
tolerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one comment about THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in pairing, but THCA likes to convert
to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to watch your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let it get overheated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't leave it in your car on a hot day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But normally kind of the ratio I like for
THCA to THC is at least like a 20 to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 20 parts THCA to one part THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be measured, of course,
tested medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what's in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have access to that,
there are some people on YouTube who have
[SPEAKER_02]: done some, kind of they show you how they
make THCA from the raw cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can have a psychological effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can have a psychoactive effect if you
go really high dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because remember with every THCA
milligram, let's say some THC is coming
[SPEAKER_02]: along with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it will convert.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't convert as fast as I think
people think it does or how I used to
[SPEAKER_02]: think it would convert pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks like it's, as long as you
keep it in the fridge, it should be OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my patients who are using THCA for
seizures, I have a couple kids in my
[SPEAKER_02]: practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA is the only thing that helped with
seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD didn't help.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC didn't help.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these kids are not showing any signs
of impairment.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, what they're showing is improved
neurocognitive function because the
[SPEAKER_02]: seizures are down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you finding that in your
practice, you're using the acid forms more
[SPEAKER_00]: than the decarboxylated forms?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I would say that it's the kind of all
lumped together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on the person's
response.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a method I describe in my book,
rule it in or rule it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we start with one compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: We dose it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look for a sweet spot if there is one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can find some benefit without side
effects at a certain dose, I have ruled it
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's either no response at all at low,
medium, high doses or a negative response,
[SPEAKER_02]: as long as it's not from these nuances of
cannabis like biphasic properties where
[SPEAKER_02]: low doses do one thing and high doses do
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we try to sort all that out as we're
going through the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's ruled out, it's ruled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, sometimes it could be the the
particular product, as you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because not all CBD is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come from different plant genetics
and one might see your chemistry better
[SPEAKER_02]: than another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes we'll try a new cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we'll try a different product in
the same category.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Dr. Sulak and I have a very similar
saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We treat the patient, not the condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with cannabis, it truly is like an
individual approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some patients that don't tolerate
THC or CBD or CBG, but they do tolerate
[SPEAKER_02]: the acids and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some people just do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tolerate everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just we figure out what works
best at what dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do find that laying cannabinoids just to
add that in for some people is really a
[SPEAKER_02]: very good answer because you can keep them
low dose because they synergize and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can get sometimes better results from that
synergy of the of those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compounds rather than one compound at a
higher dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I think it was Danny Meery who
had a graphic in one of his presentations
[SPEAKER_00]: that really sort of showed how the
different cannabinoids when used together
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of layer on top of each other and
kind of create the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we've all come to know and love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's important to understand
that all of that takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody can just kind of look at you and
go, OK, you should take this, this and
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they can, then I would say go
to that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, it has to be a little
trial and error.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my research with biomarkers on
children with autism is trying to help
[SPEAKER_02]: dial that down a little bit to give us a
little more narrow or a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: insight into who might respond to what.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is that approach one that's kind of
foreign to most physicians?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they are they used to having a more
clear sort of standard of care that when
[SPEAKER_00]: they start using cannabinoids,
it's a little bit out of their comfort
[SPEAKER_00]: zone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're not taught that way in medical
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taught, OK, here's the condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the standard of care, the approved
medications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you can even get sued for not
following standard of care.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and we're taking a different
pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of how allopathic
medicine works, which is that kind of you
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have this condition, here's the and
most mostly everything's evidence based.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, a lot of the
pharmaceuticals, even as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: the treatment sometimes can be worse than
the condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to treat somebody with a medication
that now creates so you're treating them
[SPEAKER_02]: for pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they have maybe their pain is cut
by 50 percent, but now they have nausea
[SPEAKER_02]: and constipation on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you really helped that patient?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with cannabis, one of the goals is to
not have side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal is to and you can do that if you
learn how these compounds work and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: manipulate them into a regimen for a
patient based on that individual's
[SPEAKER_02]: response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's treating the patient,
not necessarily the condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think most, you know, I don't
magically come up with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I base my clinical decision making on what
do we know from the science and then what
[SPEAKER_02]: do I know from other patients?
[SPEAKER_02]: And but I also explain to the patients,
the parents, it's going to be a little
[SPEAKER_02]: trial and error.
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, there's really very little
harm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the things that I try to
get across at the conference and in just
[SPEAKER_02]: in general, any time I speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this nonsense about it being unsafe
is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a 15 year old abusing THC,
yes, you're going to have problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not the case for medically
supervised or even patients using cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: medically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not you cannot lump them into the
same basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is completely separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things you mentioned to
this whole idea of treating the patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily the condition in in your
presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you're you're talking about
patients who have a laundry list of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You call them unicorns just because they
are so unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speak a little bit about that and how
you know what that's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think Dustin, Dr. Sulak, Eloise and
myself, who I'll practice clinically,
[SPEAKER_02]: have all found, as well as many other
cannabis physicians, that you end up
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing patients who have not been kind of
the typical patient who responds to other
[SPEAKER_02]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually what we call a refractory
practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is unfortunate because why should
somebody suffer for years before they can
[SPEAKER_02]: find cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: It should never be last resort,
especially for conditions for which the
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment is not great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know it's not great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, in taking care of pediatric epilepsy
patients, I read just I try to read every
[SPEAKER_02]: single paper and every paper says these
medications are burdensome in their side
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It acknowledges it right there and then
goes on to recommend that medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just find that like even as a
parent, if I had a young child having
[SPEAKER_02]: seizures, is that excite me to put them on
a medicine that's going to slow down their
[SPEAKER_02]: brain and potentially interfere with their
ability to learn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we know what seizures do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what these medications can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if cannabis can play a role to help,
I don't know why everybody's so afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say long term, long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they introduce some of these
anti-seizure meds, they didn't have long
[SPEAKER_02]: term studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we knew that they had bad side
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there seems to be this double standard,
you know, with cannabis to have to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve this very high bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll tell you, it achieves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People who do not get good results,
they're paying out of pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: They stop buying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody is taking it just to take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there are people who, again,
there is problematic THC use out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that is not banning it or prohibiting
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to educate and we have to educate
kids when they're between the ages of
[SPEAKER_02]: eight and 12 about all substances and why
they would probably leave it alone if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're healthy so that their brain can
develop and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that if they're sick, that some of
these compounds that are being talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about that are, quote, bad for you are not
used medically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, you know, we're getting into that
psychedelic world where all the
[SPEAKER_02]: psychedelics are being looked at,
you know, coming around and saying there
[SPEAKER_02]: is some benefit here, especially when
medically supervised and used
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, you know, this whole idea of
it has to be FDA approved and it has to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a randomized controlled trial of placebo
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life doesn't work that way for some of
these patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't sit around and wait for us to
discover a pharmaceutical that works when
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis can actually give them a better
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not talking even cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about just day to day
functioning, feeling better, being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: manage the condition well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great point you make about the
bar being set very high for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the proof's in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It meets it because, like you said,
there are a lot of things working against
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are using cannabis as a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost, the legality, all of the access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still continue to use it because
it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're using, you know, some families
who have kids with epilepsy are spending
[SPEAKER_02]: upwards over a thousand dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything costs more these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just even over the past few years,
I think about how much money people lay
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why would they do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because their child is doing better or
because their loved one is doing better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point you say, OK,
we won't go out to eat anymore and we
[SPEAKER_02]: won't take a vacation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's terrible that you have to
give that up in order to take a medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: that just about every study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't even think of a study that
doesn't say this in a clinical studies
[SPEAKER_02]: safe and well tolerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to PubMed or Google Scholar and
just look for some clinical studies on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, it will all say safe and
well tolerated, safe and well tolerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, whether it worked, that sometimes
depends on what population that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: recruited for your practice or for your
study and also what product you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the right dose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the right chemo bar?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those questions come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But safe and well tolerated is something
that's kind of standard to see in almost
[SPEAKER_02]: every clinical study of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing you mentioned,
too, about how a lot of the patients you
[SPEAKER_00]: see are these refractory cases,
these people who have tried everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else and it's just not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me wonder about, you know,
the patients who maybe they are on a
[SPEAKER_00]: medication and yeah, it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reducing their symptoms, but maybe
it's giving them some unwanted side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're like, hey, it's better than
nothing or it's better than what I had
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me wonder how many of those people
could potentially be benefiting from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't get bad enough that they
sort of turn to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or there's the leftover stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want my doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't want my doctor to think
I'm a pothead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an extra fifty dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm on a fixed income because I'm
disabled or, you know, it's the mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have made.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have to climb to go for cannabis is
is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the things that's really
is never talked about is just how much
[SPEAKER_02]: money cannabis is saving the health care
utilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a child that gets hospitalized every
month with what we call status
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepticus, a severe seizure disorder or
a severe seizure that lasts longer than 15
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes and has to be put on a ventilator
and pump full of drugs and then,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, ICU and then rehab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole thing, when you think about
the level of illness and the high cost of
[SPEAKER_02]: that illness in our health care system,
and then you start a child on cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe they're not seizure free,
but they're not ended up in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how much money we have saved
health care at that point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why shouldn't some of that money go to
help pay for some of the medicines for
[SPEAKER_02]: these kids?
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And adult and adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to leave adults out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of circling back to sort of the
new research that's coming out in sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the new cannabinoids that you're you're
getting to work with again, I keep coming
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the the can med presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely put a link in the show
description so people can check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you were talking about a patient case
and you said, you know, at the time I only
[SPEAKER_00]: had THC, CBD and THC to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of when was that and how has your
toolbox sort of expanded since then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really been amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been doing this for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I started in 2008, it was THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you took.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, maybe a little CBD in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, in 2008, nobody was testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could walk into a dispensary in
California and you got something,
[SPEAKER_02]: a cookie or some cannabis flower or
whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, buyer beware.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what ended up happening was around
2011, 2012, the idea of testing cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: started to become more popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no requirement by the state to
test, but some companies were doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was pointing people in the direction
of, well, just go for the tested medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones that have a label, the ones that
look like now, of course, they're labeling
[SPEAKER_02]: issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I admit that back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, nobody was really talking
about CBD in 2012 and 2013 is kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: evolution of when we started hearing more
about CBD being medicinal for seizures,
[SPEAKER_02]: for inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say that I treated my first
pediatric epilepsy patient with CBD oil in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and it was hard to get, you know,
the parents had to make a zillion calls to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out who had it, where could I get
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, we were like,
is it clean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we trust it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we didn't have testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily, there were a couple of
companies that were dedicated to and
[SPEAKER_02]: devoted to these pediatric epilepsy
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were able there were about two
or three oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, now there's thousands,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that, Justin, just basically
the last decade, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what happened was THCA became
available because there was some evidence
[SPEAKER_02]: from people making their own THCA oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was an article in 1979 that
showed that THCA stops seizures in a rat
[SPEAKER_02]: model or mouse model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when you're a desperate
parent and you're up at three o'clock in
[SPEAKER_02]: the morning and you're searching through
the literature, and you come across that
[SPEAKER_02]: and you realize you can just go in
California, get raw cannabis and make a
[SPEAKER_02]: tincture out of it and then give it to
your kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always started hearing these
anecdotal stories of kids with THCA
[SPEAKER_02]: stopping their seizures or reducing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then CBG came out, then CBDA, and then
CBDV and THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, you know, the alphabet soup
continues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, you know, like CBN is available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a lot, CBC is available from a
few companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBGA, raw flour that is before it,
you know, starts to have THCA and CBDA in
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of these compounds have some
evidence in the scientific literature of
[SPEAKER_02]: all of them anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them target cannabinoid receptors,
some don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of them target TRIP receptors or TRIP
channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: The TRIP channels are highly involved in
pain and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of overlap in the areas of the
body where cannabinoid receptors are and
[SPEAKER_02]: their targets of these cannabinoids are
endocannabinoids target TRIP channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's now become this, what I call the
wall of vitamins at the store where I go
[SPEAKER_02]: in and I look and I go, oh no,
I don't know which one to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's so helpful to have like
medical practicums.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really understand what maybe some
of these compounds do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in general, a pretty neurotic,
physician, but with cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel little less neuroses because of all
this experience I have, but knowing that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're safe and always start low,
tie trade up, understand the compound,
[SPEAKER_02]: read everything you can about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have an understanding, but the
reality is sometimes you get an off target
[SPEAKER_02]: and the patient will tell you,
they know, they have anxiety or they say,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it actually made my pain worse
or I feel nauseous.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on the wrong path.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to change something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get, I have to imagine that,
you know, with each new cannabinoid that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes online, you know, it just gets that
much more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have almost too much variety to choose
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we need doctors to come learn
about cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the patients can have a guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember they're going to pretty much
discover if you give them the tools,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can discover what works for their own
body.
[SPEAKER_02]: You yourself, you're empowering patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be advocates for their own health.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not just saying, here's a drug see
in three months, you are helping them kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of explore this and find their
personalized or customized regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking, you know, cancer
treatment is now becoming very
[SPEAKER_02]: personalized, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's should not be cookie cutter when you
have, and one of the reasons I say,
[SPEAKER_02]: I see refractory patients is because
they've been treated with a cookie cutter
[SPEAKER_02]: type treatment and, but they don't fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not a cookie, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a piece of cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we want to, we want to be able to
help those people as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't want to abandon them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had patients come to me and say
that medical communities abandon us
[SPEAKER_02]: because either our child or I don't
respond to what they gave us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I've become like a problem
patient, but for many of these patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis can turn things around and having
this huge arsenal of different
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just all about THC and CBD
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to imagine that you must
constantly be reading up on the latest
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you like going to
conferences and things like that is to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that you are always expanding
that arsenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very hard to keep up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The information is coming out at the speed
of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are more clinical trials coming out
on cannabinoids and humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have these studies like the one I
mentioned about dementia with CVDA and
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, my father's 93 and a half and he I,
last night I FaceTime with him and he's
[SPEAKER_02]: doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have him on CBD, CBDA, CBG, and very
ultra low dose THC at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's some evidence that ultra low
dose THC can be beneficial for
[SPEAKER_02]: neurocognition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's not perfect at 93 and a half,
but he's at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: He cooks dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: He giggles along with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, last time I visited, we did a trivia
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he grew up, he's a Lower East Side of
New York City.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows the city in and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was a street kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, he had a home,
but you know, he ran around on the
[SPEAKER_02]: streets, let's say, you know, back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was born in 1930.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could tell me streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could tell me the names of all the
bridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could tell me the names of when they,
or the gear that they built the subway and
[SPEAKER_02]: the year that they built this and that,
and this building and that building.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, pretty sharp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of that I'm sure is genetics and
some of that I'm sure is living a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy lifestyle as, you know,
throughout his years, not being a heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: substance abuser and not smoking
cigarettes and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's amazing to me that he still has
it all together and this is on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't tell me that it's bad for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not bad for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is bad for you if you have problematic
use, but again, medical use is just can be
[SPEAKER_02]: astounding for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Bonnie, I do want to be mindful
of your time, but winding down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, in addition to come to the
practicum and make sure that you meet with
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnie and the other doctors here,
but are there other resources or ways
[SPEAKER_00]: people can maybe get in touch with you or
learn from you that you want to share with
[SPEAKER_00]: the audience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, first thing is that some of the
lectures from cannabis can med 2023 are
[SPEAKER_02]: available and I recommend people looking
at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go back to them all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back and looked at the hop.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that hop latent virus that the
plants have?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was trying to educate some other
people and I said, I'm just going to watch
[SPEAKER_02]: the doctor's video presentation one more
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got all the details and then I'm able
to really talk about it in a way that I
[SPEAKER_02]: understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I supplement that with reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so I definitely recommend the can med
2023 lectures that are online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whichever ones are online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, not to cut you off, but we have
all of the can med lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous years up on our website.
[SPEAKER_02]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a YouTube channel under my name,
Bonnie Goldstein, M.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: and Bonnie's B1 and I without the E.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have my Instagram account where I
try to post as much like new studies and
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of give people, OK, this is
what's coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: What what what researchers are working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to put out anything new out there
that I think might be helpful for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, my book, which is in
your background and I'm embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a copy sitting here at my
desk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my book Cannabis is Medicine gives you
a very nice walk through the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system, the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a chapter called How to Use
Cannabis as Medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It explains what ratios are like.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it mean to have a CVD to THC
ratio?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a concentration?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many milligrams in in an ML?
[SPEAKER_02]: And gives people just kind of a step by
step approach to how to start a cannabis

I think, that I cover with some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to have a book out there in
that there's new research coming out all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you have to, you know,
like stop adding things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully a rewrite is coming out.

update it.

Medicine, updated from my first book,
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Revealed.
