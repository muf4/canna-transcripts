[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a good place to start is why
don't you tell us how you got involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: researching cannabinoids and athletics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was not a linear path, as I don't
think anybody's ever really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my undergraduate degree is in
molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a master's degree in
applied physiology and I was always
[SPEAKER_01]: athletic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with my physiology degree,
we were always looking at, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: training principles or just basically
principles of physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of how can you really push the human body
to do things that you want it to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially using non-pharmacological
agents?
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at, you know, training
principles or nutrition or even
[SPEAKER_01]: supplementation, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked with athletes and I also
worked clinically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a patient population.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the biggest driving factor behind it
with my husband's actually was an athlete,
[SPEAKER_01]: a professional athlete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been together since we were 17
years old and I would watch him play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, this is not going to
end well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you keep on, you know, the head contact
and the contact and the contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just knowing, having a background
really of molecular mechanisms and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding what was happening all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started to really look for ways to
reduce the neural inflammation,
[SPEAKER_01]: just thinking like, I don't want to be
feeding you with a straw when we're 80
[SPEAKER_01]: years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of things you can do,
which is the empowering part about
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding physiology is there's a ton
that you can do to really help support
[SPEAKER_01]: your system to reduce those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started looking specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when he was playing really was in the
2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll date myself here, but it was
really the height of the opioid epidemics
[SPEAKER_01]: in athletics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was a lot of exposure of
opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we had teammates that ended
up with opioid problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We buried some teammates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know, there has to be
something better than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to understand that,
I wanted to understand the mechanisms of
[SPEAKER_01]: how opioids worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started to look at the molecular
mechanisms in the brain of how opioids
[SPEAKER_01]: were actually working and physiologically,
like why are people, how does it kill you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is happening here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I came across research that
suggested that using cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could actually reduce the required
amount of opioids to have the same pain
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was thinking like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would that even work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really know anything about
cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I was a downhill ski
racer and I played rugby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always like, you know, an endorphin
junkie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we understood cannabis from like a
recreational cultural standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always around, but I didn't really
understand anything about the molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanisms, which was shocking because I'd
already finished two degrees that were
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on molecular mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had never seen anything about the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, I started looking at that and
I kind of went down a rabbit hole and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have been there for probably the last 10
or 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just looking at the different
ways that the endocannabinoid system can
[SPEAKER_01]: work really in neuroinflammation,
but it really goes everywhere throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: your whole body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was looking at things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I applied to, you know,
I thought, okay, well, I think that I saw
[SPEAKER_01]: the mechanism that I really wanted to look
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the calcium channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just getting like super nerdy here,
but it was the calcium channels in the
[SPEAKER_01]: neurons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, well, like who's looking at
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I looked for any supervisor,
anywhere that was actually studying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, after having a couple of
people tell you, you're totally crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's like, Hey, have you ever
looked at using cannabis to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: neuroinflammation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people are like, yeah,
okay, next.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're talking about,
but my supervisor now, he was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: first people, it was like the only paper
that I actually found at that time that
[SPEAKER_01]: was published specifically talking about
some of the cytokines and chemokines that
[SPEAKER_01]: happen, you know, when you have
neuroinflammation and the potential for
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some things that cannabinoids could
do to reduce those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I contacted him and he knew exactly
what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like so thrilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought I was going to have to
beg him to take me on as a graduate
[SPEAKER_01]: student, but he said, Oh, oh yeah,
like I would love to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to look at concussion
specifically with concussion and
[SPEAKER_01]: neuroinflammation in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he was happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right after that, we saw the call from
the NFL.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually outside watering my first
cannabis plant that I ever grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it came across my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Patrick, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the NFL is actually putting up money
to study the thing that I just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this is why we want to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I didn't really think we would
apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that he'd be like, okay,
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're not crazy, you know,
where this is not some, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people think that, yeah, someone else
thinks this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he would, but instead he was like,
okay, yeah, we're going to apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he went and he gathered,
and he is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gathered people that he had worked
with over the course of his career to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at, like, we're looking at so many
different metrics, but we had to put in
[SPEAKER_01]: for, it was an NIH adjudication to go
through, you know, all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers that applied for the funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we were selected as the group
that the NFL would fund to look at all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different metrics for using cannabinoids,
for neuroinflammation, concussion,
[SPEAKER_01]: pain, and then opioid sparing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's my one supervisor that took me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm actually double supervised.
[SPEAKER_01]: My other supervisor is the Dean of
Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my PhD is in pharmacy at the University
of Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two are my supervisors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a team, an amazing team of
people that are looking at so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different metrics of, yeah, how we can use
cannabinoids to potentially reduce some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things, you know, so for me,
it's very personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have people in my life, like we are
surrounded by athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in sports and, you know,
you can only change so many rules and
[SPEAKER_01]: redesign a helmet and a mouth guard in so
many ways, but unless you're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on the molecular things inside
the skull, you're missing a massive
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to do something that I
believe, you know, we need the data and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why we're getting it to prove that
what, what we believe to be true is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually happening in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a ton of preclinical,
there's a ton of animal models that show
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but because of the laws and the
prohibitor, you know, the prohibition and
[SPEAKER_01]: the inability for researchers to put this
substance in a human and actually draw
[SPEAKER_01]: data, which in Canada now is even doubly
ridiculous because people can walk down
[SPEAKER_01]: the street and buy it anywhere they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still actually very hard to do
research in Canada, even though at the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal level, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been legal there since 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's accessible to anybody in our
country that's over the legal age,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to do research was actually still very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's taken us so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was in 2021 and we just
finished the first portion of the clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I feel like there'd be a lot more
human data if the policies would have
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed researchers to do the research
that they've been trying to do for a
[SPEAKER_01]: really long time.
I mean, I feel like there'd be a lot more
human data if the policies would have
allowed researchers to do the
