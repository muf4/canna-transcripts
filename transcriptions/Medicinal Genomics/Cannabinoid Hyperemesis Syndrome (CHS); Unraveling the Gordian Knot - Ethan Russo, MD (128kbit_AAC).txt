[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about cannabinoid
hyperemesis syndrome today, which is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the few true contraindications to using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a conflict of interest in that
CredoScience has originated a screening
[SPEAKER_00]: test for the genomics of this disorder,
so I do have a vested interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the paper that came out of it,
and we're going to be discussing this in
[SPEAKER_00]: detail subsequently after some
introductory material.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also open source, so you can
access it on PubMed free or at ethemruso
[SPEAKER_00]: .org at the library tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a real mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was first described in 2004 in
Australia in eight patients, but the index
[SPEAKER_00]: patient, the first one that manifested
symptoms was cleared back in 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine going eight years with
this mysterious illness that nobody could
[SPEAKER_00]: treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They nailed the description because what
they said now 20 years ago is exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: description of the syndrome today,
which is a combination of nausea,
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting, abdominal pain, and hot water
bathing behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was among people who had no
knowledge of other people being similarly
[SPEAKER_00]: affected, so it wasn't a matter of one
person saying, hey, if you take a hot
[SPEAKER_00]: shower, you'll feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is associated with cycles of
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, abstinence from cannabis or CB1
agonists is the only effective treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as we'll see, haloperidol or capsaicin
on the skin may be helpful for an acute
[SPEAKER_00]: attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to our study, the biggest case
series was in 98 patients at the Mayo
[SPEAKER_00]: Clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a review in 2018 that found 105
citations about this disorder,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's more since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the best article on its
pathophysiology is DiVuono in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: She described a prodromal phase of
nephritis and nausea and vomiting and
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety and sweating, followed by the more
classic hyperemesis with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: accompanying symptoms, and then if the
person abstains from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: then recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a 2012 study that looked at the
cost that people had incurred between
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency visits and diagnostic tests,
all for naught, and that figure was 95,000
[SPEAKER_00]: then, so you can imagine what it might be
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there have been at least
two deaths directly attributable to this,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it wasn't cannabis that killed them,
but the syndrome did because of
[SPEAKER_00]: hyponatremia and accompanying problems
related to the emesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, the standard antiemetics,
the 5-HT3 antagonists like Ontansitron and
[SPEAKER_00]: Granicitron, don't work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the DiVuono article,
and they had this nice diagram that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you can't read, but again,
describing possible pathophysiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've heard before, cannabinoids,
including THC, can have biphasic dose
[SPEAKER_00]: responses, so everyone knows that a small
dose of THC is good for nausea and
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting and chemotherapy, but anyone can
vomit from cannabis if their THC intake is
[SPEAKER_00]: too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, if this is done on a chronic
basis, there's a down regulation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1 receptor where THC works, and under
those conditions, THC can act as an
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonist and, again, might induce
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very prominent aspect of this disorder
is activation of the hypopituratoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypothalamo-pituitary axis, HPA,
and she had pointed out that there could
[SPEAKER_00]: be a genetic predisposition, but at that
time, that wasn't defined, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly something we wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will hear from a lot of people that
this is due to pesticides or anemia
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure, but that's totally
unsubstantiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this bizarre study in 2018,
so this study was done at Bellevue,
[SPEAKER_00]: the big public hospital in New York City,
and among people who didn't present with
[SPEAKER_00]: CHS, they asked them about their cannabis
habits and whether they had ever vomited
[SPEAKER_00]: and whether it was better if they took a
hot shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They created their own definition of CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: They estimated that 33% of heavy cannabis
users might have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you extrapolate that to the US
population, it would be 2.75 million
[SPEAKER_00]: people affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another agency estimated 350,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the truth is somewhere in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: An important point in this study,
in 2013, there was this 30-year-old guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he had a history of CHS based on the
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a heavy cannabis user, but had a
job where he had urine testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he stopped the cannabis, and this is an
unfortunate common scenario, in favor of
[SPEAKER_00]: using synthetic CB1 agonists for which
they normally aren't going to show on
[SPEAKER_00]: urine testing, and he resumed having CHS
symptoms, so he hadn't used cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tested him.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not see him.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not see THC metabolites,
but did see evidence of the synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he quit everything, he cleared his
symptoms in two weeks, so this shows that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a problem with hyperstimulation over
the long-term in the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this similarly can happen with
Delta-8, synthetic that people are making
[SPEAKER_00]: out of excess CBD as a way to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is weaker as an agonist as compared to
Delta-9, but in this case report,
[SPEAKER_00]: this 38-year-old woman clearly had
symptoms of CHS related to Delta-8
[SPEAKER_00]: gummies, and then this case that I really
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a six-year-old who had seizures as
a result of encephalitis, and had been on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol as Epidiolex, which is about
98% pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are vanishingly small amounts of THC
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This patient had five episodes and six
months of vomiting lasting one to two
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They assumed it was CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one more episode after stopping,
and then there weren't any, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: decided that this was related to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's highly questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not know if someone took absolutely
pure CBD, whether that would trigger it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My suspicion is no, but everybody we've
talked to so far has relapsed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's often because CBD is rarely
that pure, particularly in the current
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got sick of hearing that various other
things were causing CHS, whether
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides or nemes, so I wrote this
editorial in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy had the crazy idea that
hop-latent viroid caused it, despite the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that not only has this virus never
caused disease in humans, no plant virus
[SPEAKER_00]: has ever caused the disease in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just a theory with nothing
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nemoil is an organic pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can search very carefully in the
literature, and you'll barely find any
[SPEAKER_00]: instances of toxicity from this,
and the toxicity that is there is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct from CHS, and that's true of its
most active ingredient, azetiractin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very hairy molecule that you see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an extremely high boiling point
of almost 800 degrees Celsius,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about the temperature of a
burning tip of a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea that this might be turned into
something else that's more toxic than
[SPEAKER_00]: azetiractin itself is really far-fetched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just about pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides are a huge problem where it's
not monitored properly in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you know, the things that they
do, like organophosphates and other agents
[SPEAKER_00]: that cause endocrine disruption or
potential carcinogens, they don't resemble
[SPEAKER_00]: the symptomatology of CHS either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, back to our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hypothesized that this could have a
genetic cause, and the reason for thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: this is we all know people who use great
volumes of cannabis and have never had
[SPEAKER_00]: this problem, whereas others do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that there might be mutations
on a variety of genes, and our top
[SPEAKER_00]: candidates were the CB1 gene, CNR1,
the TRPV1 gene, that responds to heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: capsaicin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that it had something to do with the
breakdown, metabolic enzymes for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be done with genomic
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an extensive questionnaire that was
developed to make sure that people had the
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis that was active and that they
had a genetic diagnosis already from
[SPEAKER_00]: someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to make sure that people who
hadn't been misdiagnosed and didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: current symptoms, so they were eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This went through an institutional review
board, and we recruited over a year 585
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 205 that had had a diagnosis of
CHS and had active symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the ultimate study group.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99 of those agreed to get a genomic test
kit, but this is where it got hairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 28 returned them, and unfortunately,
this was primarily due to active
[SPEAKER_00]: dissuasion from some people in the CHS
community that questioned our motives in
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had 54 controls that were
high-volume cannabis users that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the symptoms, and 12 of those agreed
to testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it or not, this is the largest CHS
study to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the methodology of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions about it,
why don't you ask Kevin McKernan,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he'll understand it and I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the summary of the survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 205 CHS patients, again,
high-frequency users, 91% daily or more,
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily using high-THC preparations,
especially flour, and an average of four
[SPEAKER_00]: grams a day, which is very high intake
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost 16% had had a diagnosis of CHS or
cannabis dependency or addiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and over half it had withdrawal symptoms
that were significant to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not common either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost 90% had symptoms improve after they
stopped, but almost all had relapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the controls, the use patterns were
quite similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they'd all been recent users,
70% daily or greater, and smoking high-THC
[SPEAKER_00]: predominant material, again, an average of
four grams a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really were comparing like-to-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to the CHS patients,
less than 4% had ever been labeled as
[SPEAKER_00]: being addicted or dependent, and
three-quarters had never had withdrawal
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 11% had been told to stop for any
health-related reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a bunch of comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the survey, a vast majority smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, 100% of the controls were current
cannabis smokers, and you can't see it
[SPEAKER_00]: very well, but on the right, that's a
graph of daily intake, and the big spike
[SPEAKER_00]: is at four grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know the composition of the
cannabis that you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the vast majority, it was the blue
is THC predominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your use of cannabis adult use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the bluish-purple there.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6% purely medical and 38% both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use patterns, I can't even read the
captions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, treated for dependency or
addiction, the majority of the CHS
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had to stop for a health
reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the majority of the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Withdrawal, three-quarters of the controls
had never had withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were symptoms of withdrawal,
anxiety, difficulty with sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that you would imagine in any
other context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Periodic nausea and vomiting, and this is
how often it happened for many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was daily, weekly, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: That figure was zero for controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hospitalizations for nausea, again,
the vast majority of the CHS patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That figure was also zero for the
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And abdominal pain, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone of the CHS patients had severe
abdominal pain and none of the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, varying from daily to weekly or
episodically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episodes lasting anywhere from days to
months at a time, it would really depend
[SPEAKER_00]: on whether people were continuing to use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the condition improve after cessation
of cannabis usage?
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a period of abstinence, did the
symptoms resume?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, vast majority, that was true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how long it took, really was a
function of cannabis usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just say in general that when people
start back, often they do so gingerly and
[SPEAKER_00]: may not have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem will occur with dose
escalation or at a point that they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They develop tolerance, again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an opinion as to the cause of
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of people thought it might be
genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of people didn't think that they
believed in the diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6% thought it was related to neem or
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a chart on the demographic
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: In both instances, there were more women
than men.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's typical of the
demographics in the actual population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that women are more patient to
fill out a long questionnaire and engage
[SPEAKER_00]: in a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see again, smoking habit,
86% were daily consumers and CHS and 70%
[SPEAKER_00]: in the control subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big difference came in symptoms of
abdominal pain, nausea, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: so high figures for CHS and zero for the
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is hesitant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, this may be hard to read,
but we looked specifically at a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go into each of these in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bottom line is there were five genes
where there were mutations in the CHS
[SPEAKER_00]: patients that were statistically
significantly different than the controls
[SPEAKER_00]: that didn't have CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first hypothesized gene was CNR1 that
encodes for the CB1 receptor where THC
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in prior studies, there have been
SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms that
[SPEAKER_00]: were associated with cannabis usage,
but we didn't see that in the CHS
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is an important point of
distinction because there is this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: called cyclic vomiting syndrome that is
distinct from CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a form fruited of migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It often will begin in a child who has
episodes of vomiting for no apparent
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, has a family history of migraine,
and only when they're older, teen,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even adult will they develop more
classic hemicranial pain, nausea,
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting, and sensitivity of the eyes to
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this test could form a distinction
between CVS, cyclic vomiting syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: where cannabis helps, and CHS,
where cannabis hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was, unfortunately,
gastroenterology just published this
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion piece that made me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnie sent it to me, and she'll tell you
what my response was.
[SPEAKER_00]: My reaction was, but they conflated CHS
with CVS, saying they're subsets of one
[SPEAKER_00]: another or something, and they said it
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: CHS is a subtype of cyclic vomiting
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really dangerous and inaccurate
statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: My letter to the editor has been
submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if they bother to print it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so one theory was wrong,
but still helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know anything about this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't something we hypothesized,
but this is COMT,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ketocoyl-O-Methyltransferase gene that
breaks down dopamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a mutation on this gene in
57% of the CHS patients, and only 10% of
[SPEAKER_00]: controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the P value was significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's a loss of function in this
gene, it leads to dopamine excess,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can lead to compulsive behavior like
gambling, sex addiction, or substance use.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular mutation has also been
associated with depression, rumination,
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior, and alcoholism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are risk factors for the same
population, and we've come to know a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of patients who are affected, and they
tend to have other substance abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been associated with
impulsivity, attention deficit,
[SPEAKER_00]: obsessive-compulsive disorder,
anxiety, and psychosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, risk factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the genes we did hypothesize as
being involved wasn't in fact the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is TRIPV1 for that receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mutation was in 71.5% of the CHS
patients, and only 30% of controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: TRIPV1 does a lot of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it present in the gut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it present in the brain?
[SPEAKER_00]: It mediates long-term depression in the
hippocampus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It controls glutamate release in the
solitary tract that affects gut motility
[SPEAKER_00]: and secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a prior study, no mutations on this
gene were seen in cannabis dependency,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they may not have been dealing with
CHS patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a new mutation that wasn't
previously listed in the databases,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this really suggests a linkage to mood
and the gut phenomena of CHS, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: the hot water bathing, because that will
stimulate TRIPV1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also explains why capsaicin on the skin
will help.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one that we hypothesized was,
again, metabolic enzymes for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CYP2C9, as we heard from Bonnie
yesterday, is the main enzyme that breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: down THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this instance, there was a
homozygous mutation, two copies,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was seen in almost half of the CHS
patients, and only 10% of controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this breaks down a bunch of other
things, including arichidonic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: the precursor, to anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this enzyme is not functioning
properly, it could lead to THC
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation, and maybe kick it into that
range where it's proimetic rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: antiimetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also possible that, because the
enzyme is screwy, that it could make
[SPEAKER_00]: abnormal metabolites that could be toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously, there was one case report of a
mutation on CYP2C19, along with 2C9,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that patient had CHS, also dependency
and a personality disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we found another dopamine gene,
and this is the one that codes for the D2
[SPEAKER_00]: dopamine receptor that's the target of
most antipsychotic drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 61% of the CHS patients had the
mutation, and only 20% of the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stimulants of the DRD2 are proimetic and
also affect gut motility, so this fits
[SPEAKER_00]: well as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, depression and anxiety go along
with this mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's been associated with cigarette
addiction, Tourette syndrome, and chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that we've got two genes
affecting dopamine metabolism really helps
[SPEAKER_00]: explain the symptoms of CHS and also the
psychiatric sequelae that seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: accompany it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one was, again, something we
hadn't predicted, the ABCA1 ATP binding
[SPEAKER_00]: cassette transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a homozygous mutation, two copies,
and 68% of CHS patients and only 20% of
[SPEAKER_00]: controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a gene affecting cholesterol and
phospholipid balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also associated with APOE
accumulation and A-beta deposition and
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having two copies of this would place
people at risk for a bunch of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: including dementia later in life,
also coronary artery disease and type 2
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polymorphisms in a closely related gene
were also associated with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: dependency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found five mutations with plausible
etiologic roles in the phenomenology of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome that were
statistically significantly different from
[SPEAKER_00]: high-volume cannabis users that didn't
have the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel that this battery represents this
green test that could reduce costs and
[SPEAKER_00]: fruitless searches for other causes of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just read this from the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome can
contemporaneously be conceived of not as a
[SPEAKER_00]: functional gastrointestinal disorder,
but rather as a manifestation of gene
[SPEAKER_00]: environment interaction in a rare genetic
disease unmasked by a toxic reaction to
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are links.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a website, what-is-CHS.com,
where there's more information for
[SPEAKER_00]: caregivers or patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a link to the test if you would want
to order this for someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have nine seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
