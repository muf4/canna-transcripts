[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, good morning, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited and honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank the Can Med 2024 crew
for all their work in putting on this
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what a wealth of information that
we've received these past few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really, really overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if somebody will tell me how to work
these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should have been oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it, I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good, good, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no financial commitments,
conflicts to declare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the objectives of my talk,
the talk is entitled Cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: Endometriosis, A Potential Treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will describe endometriosis and its
clinical picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at its etiology and the current
treatment options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll examine how cannabis seems
uniquely suited to treat the many aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe a promising treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a case study and I hope that I
can get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to really go through this
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more item.
[SPEAKER_00]: We no longer live in a binary world.
[SPEAKER_00]: My intent is to use inclusive language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though, yes, I might slip up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when describing research findings,
this discussion will use the gender
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology in the research that the
researchers use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is endometriosis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Endometriosis is defined as the presence
of a functioning endometrial-like tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the uterus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, the lining of the uterus is
where the endometrial tissue is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's displaced or mislocated,
it is called endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also accompanied with a chronic
inflammatory reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the prevalence of endometriosis is
about 10 to 15% in the US, about 6.5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.5 million women alone have
endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The economic burden is impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exceeds $22 billion in the US alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at it compared to
diabetes, it is more costly than diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: True prevalence, though, is unknown,
mainly due to the fact that there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: inherent bias among clinicians regarding
endometriosis existing in anyone other
[SPEAKER_00]: than white females of reproductive age,
which was clearly stated in textbooks
[SPEAKER_00]: until the late 80s in textbooks in
gynecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other groups have been found to have
endometriosis, including adolescents,
[SPEAKER_00]: postmenopausal people, people of color,
and transgender males.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are actual studies looking at
transgender males and the rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other factors, including the
recognition of endometriosis is
[SPEAKER_00]: inadequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the diagnosis time ranges from 4 to 11
years, with 65% of people being
[SPEAKER_00]: misdiagnosed initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some, we don't know how many,
because they were never diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the etiology?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know the exact etiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been many theories presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's becoming more and more evident
that physiologic, genetic, environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, and immunologic dysfunction play
large roles in the etiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we used to think that endometriosis
was a disease limited to the pelvis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a systemic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a review in the Lancet by Hugh
Taylor at Yale, Yale School of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endometriosis is now considered a systemic
disease rather than a disease
[SPEAKER_00]: predominantly affecting the pelvis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This review has illuminated the fact that
we've discovered that endometriosis
[SPEAKER_00]: affects metabolism in the liver,
leads to systemic inflammation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and alters gene expression in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leading to pain, hypersensitization,
and mood disorders, which are both very
[SPEAKER_00]: common in affected patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some key factors that are
important in the systemic presence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pro-inflammatory cytokines and
shifts in circulating immune cell
[SPEAKER_00]: populations that cause inflammation
outside of the pelvis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Circulating micro RNAs have been found in
a bunch of abundance, and these can
[SPEAKER_00]: locally modulate gene expression
throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data from animal models show that cells
from endometriotic lesions can migrate
[SPEAKER_00]: into other organs, including lungs,
liver, spleen, and brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually seen endometriosis in
the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A different department was doing a biopsy
of a mass in the lung of a 35-year-old
[SPEAKER_00]: female, and it turned out to be
endometriosis, and endometrioma,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was consulted on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients with endometriosis have been
shown to have alterations in
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic,
and immune function.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, an analysis of the nurse's
health study two, done between 1998 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009, showed that women with surgically
confirmed endometriosis had a
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically significant greater risk of
cardiovascular disease than women without
[SPEAKER_00]: endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endometriosis is a disease that is a
disease of contrast, is the way I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's benign, but it is invasive and can
have distant metastases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've really just begun to discover the
extent or scope of this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's another study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty recent, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was published in November of last year,
in which it's a study that suggests
[SPEAKER_00]: another possible contributing factor to
the etiology or part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathophysiology or the result of
endometriosis, and it looked at the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system and the microbiome
and how it can influence endometriosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulating inflammation and pain
perception and the microbiome influencing
[SPEAKER_00]: immune responses and hormonal balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: An unhealthy gut, now this is really
important because actually I've run into
[SPEAKER_00]: this clinically more often than you would
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: An unhealthy gut called dysbiosis can
create an enzyme called
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-glucuronidase, and beta-glucuronidase
reactivates estradiol and causes it to
[SPEAKER_00]: recirculate mimicking higher estrogen
levels, making women seem like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogen dominant when they really aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just recirculating of the estrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's evidence that a dysregulation of
the endocannabinoid system and the gut
[SPEAKER_00]: influence endometriosis symptoms and
progression via changes in CB1 receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: expression and changes in circulating
levels of the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: More research is definitely needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the symptoms of endometriosis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well dysmenorrhea is the most common
symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects at least 70% of the patients,
but this is progressive and worsening
[SPEAKER_00]: dysmenorrhea and pain at nonmenstrual
times of the month rather than the common
[SPEAKER_00]: menstrual cramps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infertility is also very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, many patients aren't diagnosed
with endometriosis until they undergo
[SPEAKER_00]: infertility evaluations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately up to 50% of women with
infertility are diagnosed with
[SPEAKER_00]: endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's something called endo-belly,
which actually relates to the gut
[SPEAKER_00]: dysbiosis that is part of the process,
but endo-belly is bloating, constipation,
[SPEAKER_00]: diarrhea, and really can be quite
disruptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So endometriosis really significantly
affects the patient's physiological,
[SPEAKER_00]: mental, and psychological health and their
social and economic participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many patients are on antidepressants,
anti-anxiety, and even anti-psychotic
[SPEAKER_00]: meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go around, go from doctor to doctor
complaining of pain and everyone tells you
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing wrong, you will be on
anti-psychotics too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also significantly affects the families
and partners and carers of patients with
[SPEAKER_00]: these diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the treatment options?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main factors to consider in treatment
is how severe the signs and symptoms are
[SPEAKER_00]: and whether or not the patient wants to
become pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical and surgical interventions are
comparable, cause comparable pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: 44% pain recurrence after medical
treatment and 53% pain recurrence after
[SPEAKER_00]: surgical treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conventional treatment is mediocre at best
and there's insufficient evidence on the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy of any specific medication for
relieving pain associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best treatment for endometriosis is
something that will relieve the pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: treat the other symptoms of endometriosis
and not adversely affect fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where cannabis can be an effective
treatment and far superior to what we even
[SPEAKER_00]: have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potential for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll start with the endocannabinoid
system, the master regulator of the body
[SPEAKER_00]: using Dr. Russo's term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, we're gonna talk about the
theory of clinical endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency, which suggests that in some
cases the body doesn't produce enough
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids or enough receptors for
the endocannabinoid system to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, it means the many functions
in which the endocannabinoid system is
[SPEAKER_00]: involved aren't regulated properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was proposed by Dr. Ethan Russo in 2008
and then reconsidered in 2006 and 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think after these next couple
slides that I'm here just really lulling
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Russo with a lot of praise,
but he deserves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that these happen to be quite
important in talking about endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are four tenants to conditions to
qualify as a clinical endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is an increased sensitivity to
pain called hyperalgesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people with endometriosis are commonly
hypersensitive to pain due to central pain
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The micro RNAs lead to changes in the
electrophysiologic activity and the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression in the regions of the brain
associated with pain perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be the cause as illuminated
by Taylor et al in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, all the conditions are usually
diagnosed subjectively by a process of
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusion, there being no objective tissue
or lab findings diagnostic for any one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endometriosis does not have a
patho-pneumonic signs or symptom that are
[SPEAKER_00]: specific for the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly the disease has symptoms that are
common to other GYN or even some non-GYN
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders such as fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, all are associated with a higher
incidence of anxiety and depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, probably via the micro RNAs causing
changes in the electrophysical activity
[SPEAKER_00]: and gene expression in the regions of the
brain associated with anxiety and
[SPEAKER_00]: depression as mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, number four, these conditions
often overlap with some combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: similar conditions such as PTSD,
MS, autism, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just at this point going through a few
scientific studies that show the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis being a treatment for
endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next study, Dr. Russo, 2011,
Taming THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a paper most of you have
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, should read because it really is
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a review that explored the cannabis
terpenoids and focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: phytocannabinoid-terpenoid interactions
that could produce synergy with respect to
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment of pain, inflammation,
depression, and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those four symptoms I just mentioned are
components of endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few earlier studies demonstrated,
and Dr. Russo talked about this a little
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, that GPR-18 stimulation was found
to cause migration of cells, then a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of years later this was shown to cause
migration of endometrial cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, CBD is a GPR antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can stop the migration, well,
potentially, can stop the migration of
[SPEAKER_00]: endometrial cells making a potential
prevention and treatment of endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next study was a clinical study.
[SPEAKER_00]: In persons with and without chronic pelvic
pain, they had 49 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty-nine people with endometriosis
confirmed underwent laparoscopy again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty-eight had chronic pelvic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty-one did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Samples were taken from the peritoneum of
both, and it revealed that the people with
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic pelvic pain had more TRPV1
immunoreactivity when compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people without chronic pelvic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The study showed that TRPV1 expression in
peritoneal endometriosis foci is related
[SPEAKER_00]: to chronic pelvic pain, and a subsequent
study found that CBD stimulates and
[SPEAKER_00]: desensitizes TRPV1, leading to less pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next was a review study looking
directly at CBD for the management of
[SPEAKER_00]: endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chronic pelvic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the studies in this review are
preclinical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these studies have shown that CBD
decreases the secretion of
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha, and can increase the levels of
anti-inflammatory cytokines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the anxiolytic, antidepressant,
neuroprotective, and mood-stabilizing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sleep-modulating effects of
cannabinoids in general may be very useful
[SPEAKER_00]: in the management of the non-physical
symptoms frequent among patients with
[SPEAKER_00]: endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can't leave THC out completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this next study was a mouse model was
created by a group of researchers to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure and mimic some of the conditions
in human endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These include pelvic pain, anxiety,
and cognitive deficits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mice were treated with two milligrams
per kilo of delta-9 THC daily for 28 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC was given via subcutaneous
injections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's not how we ingest THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, keep following.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mice were treated, and they found that
THC reduced pelvic pain and cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: impairments in the mice, but it had no
effect on their anxious behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, they were only using THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC may also seem to inhibit the growth
and development of the endometriotic
[SPEAKER_00]: implants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, remember, as many have said,
preclinical studies may not transit and
[SPEAKER_00]: translate to the human experience,
but this is important information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of the pre-THC treatment
and post-THC treatment of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endometriotic implant of one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since we like to use whole-plant
artesian formulas, we can't leave the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beta-carophylene causes regression of
endometrial implants in a rat model.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study looked at beta-carophylene,
and again, they used adult female rats and
[SPEAKER_00]: mimicked endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fragments of the endometrium were
implanted in the peritoneal cavity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: adult rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They watched them grow over a four-week
period, and then treatment started with
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-carophylene 10 milligrams per kilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also used 30 milligrams per kilo for
21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growth of the endometriotic
implants were measured again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also a control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beta-carophylene 10 milligrams per
kilo suppressed the growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: endometriotic implants by 52 and a half
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 30 milligram per kilo did not do as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only about 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beta-carophylene that follows along with
less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beta-carophylene also produced apoptosis,
more cell death, and also, just as
[SPEAKER_00]: important, there was no statistically
significant difference observed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility of the rats that were treated
with beta-carophylene and that were not in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what you want in treating
endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to interfere with fertility
because that really does guide treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beta-carophylene was an effective
putative treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's summarize some of this data
because I'm moving along here.
[SPEAKER_00]: GPR18 may play a role in cellular
migration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears to specifically induce
endometrial migration.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is a GPR18 antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: TRPV1 is related to chronic pelvic pain in
women.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD stimulates and desensitizes TRPV1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endometriosis appears to be associated
with a down regulation of CB1 and CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors and up regulation of TRPV1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endometriosis also appears to be
associated, excuse me, cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: agonists can potentially inhibit
endometriotic cell proliferation.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and beta-carophylene seem to be
effective putative agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please note that whole plant cannabis can
reduce pain by interacting with a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: range of cannabinoid opioid, vanilla,
serotonergic and anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors as the illustrious Dustin Sulak
pointed out in a few of his talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with endometriosis are using
cannabis and finding relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I do have time to do the case
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a, well, I have on my nose 44,
but 42 on the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was in her 40s, early 40s,
diagnosed with endometriosis who had a
[SPEAKER_00]: long history of chronic pelvic pain,
pain with intercourse and anxiety and
[SPEAKER_00]: depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had been going along for a few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: She went through medical and surgical
interventions and really did well for a
[SPEAKER_00]: short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when she entered her 40s, things
worsened.
[SPEAKER_00]: She started to develop sleep issues,
moodiness and increasing pelvic pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: pain with intercourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really starting to impact her
marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We checked her hormone levels because
women in their 40s are usually
[SPEAKER_00]: perimenopausal or certainly almost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women start to lose progesterone first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason is as the overall ovaries
start to decrease their production of
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones, testosterone also comes from not
just the ovaries, but it also comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: the adrenal glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be produced from DHEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Estradiol also can produce, is not just
produced in the ovaries, produced in fat
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and is produced by the adrenal
gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progesterone only comes from the ovaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the ovaries start to decline and
function, progesterone is the first
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone to decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a woman estrogen dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can certainly reactivate,
so to speak, the endometrial implants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We added progesterone to her regimen
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this helped her with sleep and mood
stabilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't help with the endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in most patients, I should say many
patients, maybe two-thirds of patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: progesterone does really help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does really offer a tremendous help
because it balances out the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one-third of patients with
endometriosis are progesterone resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unknown etiology of that also,
abnormal progesterone signaling,
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic inflammation, aberrant gene
expression, all can be causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But progesterone resistance leads to,
you can't counteract the effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: the estrogen dominance going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things we did is we
implemented a healthier lifestyle,
[SPEAKER_00]: modified her diet, and she lost 20 pounds
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is weight loss important?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important because in the management
of patients is because fat cells contain
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more fat cells you have around,
the more estrogen you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also adipose tissue causes chronic
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maintaining a good weight is also very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We counsel patients about eating in our
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: We counsel patients about eating real
food, following an anti-inflammatory diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: avoiding toxins, chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things actually we all should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also encourage foods that can encourage
the healthy metabolism of estrogen because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's very important as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These foods are actually the cruciferous
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain a product called
3,3-diendolamethane, which has been shown
[SPEAKER_00]: to enhance the healthy metabolism of
estrogen as opposed to allowing it to
[SPEAKER_00]: recirculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This group of vegetables includes kale,
cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and arugula.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vegetables that cause gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to warn you, it's not easy to eat a
lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also encourage exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exercise can decrease the intensity of
cramps because exercise increases
[SPEAKER_00]: anandamide levels, which can lead to
calming relief of pain and certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: improve mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yoga in particular has specific poses and
stretches for the relief of dysmenorrhea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tai Chi is another.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exercises that have spiritual
components, energy components to them are
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very effective in managing some
symptoms of endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then titrated the patient to a type 3,
that's CBD dominant tincture, 10 to 15
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams once or twice a day depending
on symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also vaporized with type 1 flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my slide you'll see a 6 plus to 1 to 3
tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not CBD dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 6 should be 10 plus always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll be CBD dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also used a, she used a, vaporized with
a type 1 flour for breakthrough pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: for sleep, or for sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The addition of, and this is the part that
was really very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The addition of a type 1 or type 2 vaginal
suppository really helped to significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the pelvic pain and allowed her to
have intercourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suppositories are hard to find and
hopefully companies are coming out with
[SPEAKER_00]: some suppositories with a shelf life and
are effective and can have a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of the plant in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I have patients make their own
and it can be difficult and cumbersome,
[SPEAKER_00]: but patients with endometriosis are
determined to relieve their pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis teas, as Dustin mentioned,
are also very helpful because you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA, put a little bud in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA will stay THCA because the water
isn't hot enough to cause, lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This patient is now productive in her
vocation, has an improved quality of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: and has a healthy sex life with her
husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, he sent me flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saying thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was really life changing for this
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to summarize, and I'm running on time,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has been used throughout history
to treat conditions in people assigned
[SPEAKER_00]: female at birth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just read Dr. Russo's history of cannabis
in OBGYN historical review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an excellent, excellent paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endometriosis is a debilitating disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects patients in all aspects of
their life, including their families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Become familiar with the theory clinical
endocannabinoid deficiency.
