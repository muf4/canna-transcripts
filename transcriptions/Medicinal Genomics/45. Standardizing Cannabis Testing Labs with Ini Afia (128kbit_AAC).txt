[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, we welcome back Iniya Fia to
talk about the push to standardize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis testing labs in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: In late November, the California
Department of Cannabis Control issued a
[SPEAKER_00]: statement that they are planning to
standardize operating procedures and
[SPEAKER_00]: methods for California cannabis labs by
January, 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: This announcement got mixed reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, consumers and producers
have expressed frustration with
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistencies in lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they welcome the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, many laboratory professionals
were quick to point out that
[SPEAKER_00]: standardization is easier said than done,
especially because the state didn't offer
[SPEAKER_00]: much insight into what exactly the DCC
would standardize or how they would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iniya is qualified to speak on this
subject because he is the chief science
[SPEAKER_00]: officer at CannaSafe, a licensed cannabis
testing lab in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has also set up multiple labs with best
in-class methodology, processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and technology throughout his career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at CannaSafe, he has led the team
towards greater credibility, consistency,
[SPEAKER_00]: and accountability for their clients,
regulators, and consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss why
lab standardization is a good idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem of lab shopping, why some labs
intentionally inflate THC values,
[SPEAKER_00]: how natural variations in the cannabis
plant can create a range of potency
[SPEAKER_00]: results, how mishandling certified
reference materials can throw off lab
[SPEAKER_00]: results, why labs need to be more
transparent with their measurement of
[SPEAKER_00]: uncertainty, and whether standardization
will stifle lab innovation, which is so
[SPEAKER_00]: important in an emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Iniya, I would like to thank this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's sponsor, CannaSafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: CannaSafe is a California-based cannabis
analytical testing lab paving the way in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry through research,
education, and social equity efforts,
[SPEAKER_00]: championing safe and effective cannabis,
hemp, and CBD for all, one test at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at CSALabs.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Iniy
[SPEAKER_00]: Afiyah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Iniy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, always.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so lab standardization in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you surprised when you saw this news
come out in late November, or was it
[SPEAKER_00]: something you knew was coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: This sort of came as a surprise surprise
announcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you looked at the regulations,
or I should say, SB 544, you knew
[SPEAKER_01]: something should have been coming,
but the way it was announced was kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was surprising about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it just seemed like it was
just thrown out there as, oh, here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how people digest this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like there could have been a little
more meat to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just sort of, hey, we're going to
standardize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody's like, okay,
what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, should have been a little
meat, potatoes to that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so have there been details kind of
since then?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to ask you about that,
because, I mean, in the articles that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: read, it's basically that, you know,
the DCC is supposed to standardize
[SPEAKER_00]: operating procedures and methods for
California cannabis labs by January 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, have you got any sort of indication
of whether they are going to involve labs
[SPEAKER_00]: like yourselves kind of in that process in
terms of recommending certain instruments
[SPEAKER_00]: or methods or standards?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has there been any more details come out
about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there hasn't been any formal
details that I've seen sort of come out
[SPEAKER_01]: about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I have seen something about the
DCC cannabis committee being formed and
[SPEAKER_01]: they were asking for some representation
of representative folks to apply to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: that committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I suppose those are all connected and
headed towards that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard some news stories about
state reference labs and whatnot that's
[SPEAKER_01]: underway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would assume all this is tied into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state recently, I've been sending out
emails to labs getting trying to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: to standardize the way they report on
their COA, specifically how labs are
[SPEAKER_01]: reporting total cannabinoids and some
units on the limits of detection and
[SPEAKER_01]: limits of quantification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think they're already starting work
towards that standardization and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the COA to all look the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably one way they're trying to
make it easier to quickly read that and
[SPEAKER_01]: folks who understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now do you have any indication,
are they going to actually standardize
[SPEAKER_00]: certain equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are labs like yours going to
potentially have to purchase new
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that stuff doesn't come cheap,
especially when you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the instruments used to analyze
pesticides and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, honestly, if they do it
correctly, which again, I'm excited to see
[SPEAKER_01]: how the state plans to execute this
because one thing to say it in a secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to execute it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that they would ever move
to the standardization of equipment or
[SPEAKER_01]: even necessarily a single compendium
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say, for instance, an AOS method or
an ASTM method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do feel that in standardization,
you know, they would recommend some
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we're talking about potency,
sort of the way USP does it is if they are
[SPEAKER_01]: putting out a compendium method,
they refer to a certain column,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a consumable, like a column,
they would say USP L1 column to designate
[SPEAKER_01]: like a C18 column, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They will necessarily say, oh,
the C18 Raptor from Restec or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Agilent or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like in some sense, no,
it wouldn't necessarily tie you to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain vendor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might force some labs to upgrade
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, my lab has high level
equipment that is able to really meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: demands or whatever sort of regulation
might be put out there in terms of limits
[SPEAKER_01]: of protection and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for folks who maybe were not thinking
ahead of that, yes, they might have to
[SPEAKER_01]: upgrade in order to meet certain limits of
detections if those are changed or even
[SPEAKER_01]: certain, let's say, potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they force you to look at the spectra,
you may have to get a different detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a UV vis, you cannot do that,
but you may have to go to a diode array
[SPEAKER_01]: detector to look at, you know,
the wavelength, several wavelengths of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you touched on a good point
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it on the table that some of the actual
requirements or regulations might change
[SPEAKER_00]: as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to potentially have to be
looking for new pesticides, new
[SPEAKER_00]: microbials, things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm really hoping that they
will.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is really of concern is the category
one pesticides that currently essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: allows the labs to set their own limits of
detection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the state does say you have to get to
point one, my grandpa program,
[SPEAKER_01]: but essentially allows labs to set as high
as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And others who are perhaps more concerned
about consumer safety or perhaps are
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing the sensitivity of their
instruments are validating accordingly and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the statistical analysis to arrive
at a set LODQ based on what they've done
[SPEAKER_01]: with matrix interference and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there are just other labs who may
take advantage of that situation and push
[SPEAKER_01]: that limit as far as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it creates this uneven playing ground
in the industry where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we'll touch on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of allows for lab shopping based
on who's LQ is here, who's LOD is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If my sample passed the one lab,
it's going to fail at the other lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hey, I'm going to go here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're trying to avoid
having that sort of uneven playground and
[SPEAKER_01]: just caring more about consumer safety and
making it standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I would assume the state
would go after things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, maybe it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should kind of set the table here and
talk about the reason why the state's
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to standardize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, for the most part,
to tackle this whole issue of variability
[SPEAKER_00]: between lab results and which can lead to,
as you said, lab shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people who aren't familiar with that
term, maybe you could explain it a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd also like to ask you kind of
how pervasive is lab shopping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it as common as we hear it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, lab shopping really is
around certain manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's about I believe there's about 43,
I want to say 43 labs in the state
[SPEAKER_01]: currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be wrong on that because,
you know, new ones are getting added
[SPEAKER_01]: daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, it's great, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's options.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because there is no standard way or
standard methodology, folks would go out
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, I might have a certain
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I use a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to send it out to five labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all going to come back given we're
dealing with an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all going to come back
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potency is going to be a little different
based on limits of detection.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pesticide residue might pass or fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a manufacturer, I'm going to,
you know, probably go with the lab that is
[SPEAKER_01]: most likely to pass me based on whatever
standards they've set for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think the problem with lab
shopping is it's many factors for issues
[SPEAKER_01]: in many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for one, it does force competition in a
detrimental way where all parties lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the consumer loses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a lab may falsify results, leading to
higher, higher prices for support and
[SPEAKER_01]: products and perhaps even false negative
products where a contaminant is being put
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So consumers are losing in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the buyers and the dispensary lose
because they're paying more for inflated
[SPEAKER_01]: values.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a lab is cheating on potency,
the regulators lose because essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: they lose control of that process if they
don't have a standardized method.
[SPEAKER_01]: The labs themselves lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As there's a race to the bottom on
pricing, we all know inflation is rising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumables are higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Test costs, unfortunately, seem to go
lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everything in the world is going
higher, but somehow test costs seem to be
[SPEAKER_01]: going lower, which doesn't make sense.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Competition is great, but they're losing
in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The employees lose work as, you know,
a race to the bottom is causing labs to
[SPEAKER_01]: now shut down as they can't remain
competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cannot afford to pay employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: The taxpayers lose because people go on
employment, unemployment increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just slippery slope.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how it really isn't great for
anybody to allow this to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of shopping, is it mostly
around potency numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it around contamination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a little bit of both or is there
sort of a test that folks are shopping for
[SPEAKER_00]: more than others?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, personally, I can tell you that I
see it a lot around potency where folks
[SPEAKER_01]: are sending in samples and you are doing
your best to give a high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And folks are saying, Hey, well,
lab B is giving me 10 points higher on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a flower in and you're testing
at 19, but lab B is testing it at 27,
[SPEAKER_01]: which clearly doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's arguments around,
Hey, it's an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a top nog?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a bottom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it outdoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it indoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's variances, but those
sort of variances are highly unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of in addition to that, I mean,
at least here locally, we're out in
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of seeing some THC numbers get
up in the realm of the very unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a friend of mine recently texted me
and said that there is a dispensary that
[SPEAKER_00]: had a bud on their menu that was 47% THC,
which I mean, you tell me, does that seem
[SPEAKER_00]: likely?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, as far as flower,
that is a flat, what do you want to call
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems highly unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care how great your growing
conditions are, but now you're starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: push the limit of what the plants could
produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: 47% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would mean THCA would have been at
least 13% higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, now you're just beginning to push
the limits of what's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really do see that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we really do see, I've done some
sort of round robin testing with some
[SPEAKER_01]: menable labs where we've sent some samples
out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower, homogenized flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's been interesting, some of them
know about it, some don't, but what's been
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting is all other cannabinoid
numbers would line up within one to 2%
[SPEAKER_01]: except THCA for certain labs would be 10
points higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about, I would get 20,
they would get 30 or other labs would get
[SPEAKER_01]: 20, some labs get 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of begs the question when
you're looking at about 10 different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and they're all lining up,
but one, why is lab B all of a sudden 10
[SPEAKER_01]: points higher on this one compound,
but all the other compounds are spot on
[SPEAKER_01]: with everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a clear indication of
inflating potency for flower based on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, those labs will not do it based
on an edible Delta 9, knowing that,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, if the manufacturer gives you a 10
milligram edible, you know, you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to give them back a result of 15
milligrams, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't quite work out or 20
milligrams, but you can on flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they build in these unscrupulous work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course we would lose business because
well, lab B does give them that number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately not much we as labs can
really do about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the onus is really on the state
to enforce some of those things from
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to imagine that a lot of this
is based too on the fact that consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: really look to that THC number as the
indicator of quality for the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still waiting for the day when that's
not the case and that consumers will look
[SPEAKER_00]: at, you know, aroma or bag appeal or just
flavor more so than just a raw THC number.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I totally, you and I both,
I think we've beat this thing to death
[SPEAKER_01]: about, Hey, it's not just about that THC
number as an indicator of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cannabinoids or cannabis,
depending on how you're using it,
[SPEAKER_01]: really depends on a myriad of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we all talk about the entourage
effect and whatnot, you know, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpens effects and there's been talk back
when, where people were saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know, this 12% flower from
California knocks my socks off and I get a
[SPEAKER_01]: 30% from Nevada and it doesn't do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, yeah, because it's
not just about the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that, you know,
the lab in the other state was cheating,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not just about that THC number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an entourage effect along with your
body as well, your receptors and how,
[SPEAKER_01]: how those behave, how you, your genetics,
are playing a factor into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it'd be great on the day when you
can really, you know, look more to the
[SPEAKER_01]: science of other compounds and not even
just cannabinoids, but the whole set of
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds and cannabis and how they play
with your receptors to really give you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, certain relief that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that end, you know, not all of us
are looking to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our socks knocked off either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're buying alcohol,
you're not going for Everclear every time
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going for a nice wine or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of these days, it's going to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can only hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but talking about the variation
between labs and you know, we've touched
[SPEAKER_00]: on the fact that, you know, some labs
might be unscrupulous and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: inflating numbers, but I was wondering if
you could talk about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just more natural variations, whether it
be like you've touched upon before that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is, is not homogeneous and
there's going to be some, some variation
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about different instruments,
different, different reference standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: different things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could, could those be, be causing the
variations as well that we're observing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's really a good point that
you brought up then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about, you know,
in our cultural product that's grown acres
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have lights hitting different
parts of it and, and your nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: getting certain parts or or disease
hitting certain parts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your cultivar wouldn't necessarily have
the same value marginally throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, yeah, lots of other factors
that affect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, it starts off in sampling,
even how you sample the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're sampling for an assay,
are you doing it in a statistically
[SPEAKER_01]: significant manner?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you picking evenly or are you only
picking top, top, top nugs versus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, smaller popcorn?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, depending on what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yes, you get to the instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the issue with the manufacturer
of your certified reference material,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to vet that very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's an isocrated manufacturer
and make sure, okay, I've, I've done my
[SPEAKER_01]: due diligence and make sure that this
compound is at the purity that they say it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it stable enough?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've seen situation where we all
know once you mix this cannabinoids even
[SPEAKER_01]: in standards together, interactions,
there's some interactions that begin to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen and there is some breakdown and
decarboxylation depending on your storage
[SPEAKER_01]: condition and how many cannabinoids are
mixed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unstable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lab has to do the due diligence and
make sure they're storing their standards
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're vetting their vendor correctly and
they're calibrating correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, each of these standards come
with a certificate of analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like we put out for the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the purity of my THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, does the vendor who did their work
and say, hey, we've done the analysis and
[SPEAKER_01]: the purity is really 90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm getting a 1,000 PPM standard,
when you shoot it on your instrument,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really 900.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as an analyst, am I typing in 1,000
into my HPLC?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the vendor says this is a 1,000
PPM standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, based on the purity, it's really
900.
[SPEAKER_01]: So technically, you should be typing in
900.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see how things start to get
funny if even the analysts may not be even
[SPEAKER_01]: unscrupulous about it, may just be
ignorant to that fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at COAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all things we have to consider
that adds to that variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these things can kind of compound
upon each other, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of create even bigger variances.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we talk about methods of
measurement of uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, has every lab really done this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you pipette has an effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it calibrated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything you do adds to your measurement
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So has all the labs necessarily analyzed
for their measurement uncertainty?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that value?
[SPEAKER_01]: How far away?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the error that you expect per your
result?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've talked about this several
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that should be reported
on a COA?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should you report your cannabinoid value
as a range rather than a single certified
[SPEAKER_01]: value?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because technically, a range makes more
sense and it's probably the most accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I get where folks wouldn't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm selling it, I'm reporting,
oh, this sample is between 18 to 21
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess there are certain folks who
are selling it that may not want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that something the state should
regulate?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I will leave that up to the
state to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about standardization,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the state's going to come out and
dictate certain standards, do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that that would potentially stifle
innovation that the labs need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've listened to panels that you've
been on on CanMed before, and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about how it never surprises you
the different matrices that come through
[SPEAKER_00]: the door and that each one is sort of a
different is a small science project to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to fully analyze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how would a standardization push like
this sort of prevent you from from doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, you got to talk about what the
the rules are looking to standardize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends really on what you're
attempting to standardize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking about homogenization?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking about the prep method,
talking about sampling or the instrument
[SPEAKER_01]: method?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we talk a lot about this,
a lot of folks refer straight to the
[SPEAKER_01]: instrument method, but forget to realize
that those other parts play probably a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger role in the variability that we
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: How labs are homogenizing their sample can
make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are you picking off Keefe
material versus are you homogenizing the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that has to be regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I do believe if we head towards
some of maybe the instrument method,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is going to stifle innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you see labs out there as more
standards become available while we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting to analyze more and more
cannabinoids, you see COAs with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 20 or more cannabinoids being
analyzed for.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gives a consumer more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you look at SB 544,
you got to ask the question, is it
[SPEAKER_01]: referring to the state reference lab
adopting a standard test or for all
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed labs being forced to adopt a
single method?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's all about interpretation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the intent of the SB 544 is
noble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the goal is to stabilize an
agricultural products potency,
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement is really the way I think they
need to head as rather than try to force
[SPEAKER_01]: labs to use a single method, which would
stifle the innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when you look at a USP, yes,
there are compendial methods out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it allows also for each individual lab
to be able to validate a method per the
[SPEAKER_01]: criteria set forth by the regulating body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, you can use my method or if you
don't or don't have that instrument,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can use this other instrument,
but you have to validate following this
[SPEAKER_01]: criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where things might be a little
bit better and easier if the state went
[SPEAKER_01]: that route.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, honestly, I think they need to
perform more on label round robins with
[SPEAKER_01]: all different cannabinoids to get the labs
to align a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it should be within a 10 percent
deviation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be as far as what we're
seeing now, up to 40 percent deviation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be able to only force labs to
analyze a certain subset of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if they do this, will they be
forcing you to analyze on the THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, CBDA, CBGA?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what exactly will they establish
a list of compounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I'm really anxious to see,
you know, what kind of how they execute
[SPEAKER_01]: this, how the DCC execute this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will really determine the success
of that program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so would you not necessarily support,
but would you expect that the state would
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially do sort of a proficiency test
where they kind of homogenize a big batch
[SPEAKER_00]: and send it out to all the labs and then
see if what the variation is between the
[SPEAKER_00]: results?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most definitely, I would expect that
something like this has been doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which, you know, we've been participating
in for all the rounds where they
[SPEAKER_01]: homogenize one and send it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the state does this, if a lab is
doing something unscrupulous, they know
[SPEAKER_01]: this and they know the right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magically, the state numbers from all
the labs are probably going to align.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the state needs to find a way
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be blinded or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be blinded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be really blinded.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state needs to find a way to do this,
probably through the producers or
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators or whoever they want to use
without the labs knowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be the true test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they just send in some manufacturer,
hey, you know, we're looking to be a new
[SPEAKER_01]: client.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll quickly find out which labs are,
you know, especially if you send them a
[SPEAKER_01]: homogenized product that will eliminate
the variability or at least reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can really see who's boosting
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what do you think about producers
and manufacturers having their own
[SPEAKER_00]: in-house testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that could sort of help
regulate or stifle some of this lab
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I've worked with a few
producers that do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the best ones work directly
with the lab and say, hey, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop this relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an HPLC in-house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see your method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get on the same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you begin to analyze together and
look at this at-school analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: the differences in your methodologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you come to some sort of consensus in
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those folks get, you know,
they would do their in-house and they will
[SPEAKER_01]: be directly in line with what is expected
because they wouldn't have to necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: depend on go-lab shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some considerations when you
want to do something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for one, you should follow some
kind of strict QAQC procedures with your
[SPEAKER_01]: third-party lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important that you're aligned
with who your CRM vendor is, even some of
[SPEAKER_01]: your consumables.
[SPEAKER_01]: The method, is it standardized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the instrument they're using,
you know, the labs have to get preventive
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance done every so often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would expect the producer to do the same
with their instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even more importantly, qualified
personnel to run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, this is not like,
you know, just a plug and play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let me do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned before, literally to
before, every day is a little experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: as you get these different matrices in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to have somebody who's
qualified to understand what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with to be able to think on their
feet and understand when things go out of
[SPEAKER_01]: whack or really understand the instrument
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I think it's a great thing that
folks should be doing, but it has to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: line with how the lab tests as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good point when you talk
about just, you know, competency of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab techs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said that, you know, there's 40
plus labs in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we know, cannabis is a very
complicated matrix with a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds and pesticides that have similar
molecular weights to the compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, not that you need to name
any names, but how much of this variation
[SPEAKER_00]: could come down to just, you know,
whether it be inexperience or incompetency
[SPEAKER_00]: as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, that is a very good
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if we'll ever find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, cheating is easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think folks hire some pretty intelligent
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cheating is really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheating consistently is not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you start to weed out
those labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen all kinds of stories in the
headlines of recalls and labs doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a lot of it, I wouldn't chalk
it up to competency.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a percentage of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do chalk it up to direct negligence on
either the analyst, the lab ownership
[SPEAKER_01]: management staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's intent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's hard to prove intent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, you know, if you look in the
right places, you can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's what unfortunately really
bothers me in that with this competition
[SPEAKER_01]: that's happening is not being regulated in
the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we cannot expect the lab to be,
you know, the regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the state needs to listen when
folks do tell them about potential issues
[SPEAKER_01]: and they should do the due diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've done great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, you know, 43 labs across the state
or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so many staff in the state
to be able to handle this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done a great job, you know,
doing their their own audits and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, maybe there's some better
ways to make it a little bit easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: weed out some of these unscrupulous
players.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's always something,
of course, I'm willing to help if needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all need to be the beacon in
this industry, you know, like somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: once said, all boats rise in the tide and
and California in its example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so winding down here and forgive me,
but I'm going to put you on the spot a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like, I mean, you're in
support of standardization and this push
[SPEAKER_00]: here, obviously, probably with some
caveats to like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a certain level that you're you're
willing to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So say I'm putting you in charge of
standardization of labs in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you definitely put me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't ready for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but honestly, how would I do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would kind of follow USP's footstep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You set out some or work, you know,
not just USP, but work with AOAC,
[SPEAKER_01]: work with ASTM with some of those
compendial methods out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's modern.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, you know, nobody wants to
work with a method that is using some ink
[SPEAKER_01]: blood test or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really look at, OK, if you want to
analyze cannabinoids, you can say give a
[SPEAKER_01]: myriad of detectors you should use,
a myriad of instrument types you should
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm talking about, you know,
HPLC or LCMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about manufacturer
specific instrument, a column
[SPEAKER_01]: specification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some mobile phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain parameters I would say
this should be followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each lab would essentially you'd have
a couple options.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be able to replicate the
standardized method and you can have your
[SPEAKER_01]: own innovative method as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and those two, based on whatever
analytes you're looking at, should match.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I randomly send you a sample and I
say run it on your standardized method and
[SPEAKER_01]: your own innovative method, you should
come up with the same results.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have the lab sort of maintain a state
reference method and they can report on
[SPEAKER_01]: their own method based on a validation
that meets the criteria that was set
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So validation is important as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set specific criteria and specific ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reference the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever other organization you would
like to reference as far as validation
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters and enforce that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondarily, continue having blind round
robins sent out randomly throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: year to make sure that labs are in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conduct a more regular audit and audit the
different areas of the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just, you know, a certain assay or
certain personnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep it fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how you keep people on their toes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how you keep people honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what I would focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And additionally, you know, the potency
thing is a huge issue, but I'm more
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned about contaminant levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making sure that labs are not putting
things out there that folks that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: detrimental to folks health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, they can play the potency
game, but when you start messing around
[SPEAKER_01]: with instrument, limit of detection to
pass things that perhaps shouldn't be out
[SPEAKER_01]: there for, you know, we always talk about
immunocompromised patients, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: just about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be the entire population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether I'm immunocompromised or not
doesn't mean I want to smoke a product
[SPEAKER_01]: full of chlorphenapir or imidacloprid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really knows how this affects your
body based on the route of administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has to be of utmost importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that's what I would really
focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding innovative and efficient ways to
enforce while enforcing on modes of
[SPEAKER_01]: validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as opposed to trying to stick a
lab to say, oh, only analysis for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids by diode array detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be the standardization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you handled the question well,
very, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be very interesting to see how
this all plays out in California and good
