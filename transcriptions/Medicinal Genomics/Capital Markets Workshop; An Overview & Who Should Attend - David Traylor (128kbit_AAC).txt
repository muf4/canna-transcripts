[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess kind of to tie it all back
to the workshop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that really sort of who you're
tailoring this content for is sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: small company who is starting up and is
looking into some of these novel compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're looking for funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can come to the workshop and kind of
learn some best practices to the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to get some funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually, it's meant to go across the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's meant to reach out to biotech
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's meant to reach out to pharma
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's meant to reach out to small
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's meant to reach out to P&G,
you know, companies that are not biotech
[SPEAKER_01]: or pharma oriented.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out on the outside looking in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what we've all been about,
GP, Golden Eagle Partners has always been
[SPEAKER_01]: about Ben is providing, you know,
trying to find the best capital for the
[SPEAKER_01]: best companies, whether it's inside or
outside of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also means to be the purveyor of
objective information to a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that are on the outside looking
in that don't understand the sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, we understand it better than
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly speaking, whether it's the big
company or small company and they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into cannabis, the smartest thing that
they could do is come to Golden Eagle
[SPEAKER_01]: Partners and say, what should we do
instead of trying to go in there and throw
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of money out and lose it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can guarantee you one thing is
for sure in cannabis, there's been a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of money lost by people that have been too
arrogant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with too little arrogance and too much
arrogance and too little humility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if companies want to understand the
cannabis sector better, especially where
[SPEAKER_01]: the science is going, then yeah,
they would be prudent to show up at the
[SPEAKER_01]: capital markets workshop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
