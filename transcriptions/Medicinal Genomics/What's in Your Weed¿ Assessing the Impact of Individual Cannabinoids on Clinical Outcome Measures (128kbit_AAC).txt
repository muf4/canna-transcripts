[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, I'd like to thank the
organizers of CanMed for so graciously and
[SPEAKER_00]: generously inviting me to once again be
part of their annual conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed is one of my absolute favorite
conferences, and I'm so sorry not to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to join you in person this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that, I will talk about what's in
your weed, assessing the impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: individual cannabinoids on clinical
outcome measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I don't really have to explain to
this audience, cannabis has been part of
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient civilizations with references to
its use spanning thousands and thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it was part of our U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacopoeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1850, doctors could and did prescribe
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a recommendation for use or a
certification for use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a prescription for any number of
indications or conditions or symptoms that
[SPEAKER_00]: patients had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through a series of events, it fell out of
favor in 1937, and by 1942, it was pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacopoeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1970, it was placed in the most
restrictive class of the newly created
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlled Substance Act, was classified
as a Schedule I substance, where it
[SPEAKER_00]: remains today, Schedule I substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1970, when cannabis was declared a
Schedule I substance, California was the
[SPEAKER_00]: very first state to re-legalize cannabis
for medical purposes in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make this point because by the time my
own state had legalized cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical purposes, and you can see in that
timeline how different states sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: followed California's lead, but by the
time Massachusetts legalized cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical purposes in 2012, there was still
absolutely nothing in the literature with
[SPEAKER_00]: regard to what I would call the long-term
or longitudinal impact of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That surprised me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much everything we know about
cannabis comes from studies of young,
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily healthy recreational cannabis
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, my lab has been studying the
impact of recreational cannabis use for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades at that time, and I was quite
interested in understanding the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in those using for
recreational versus medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I scoured the literature, figuring
there had to be something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did find some studies of acute
administration of some products for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical purposes, but nothing that looked
at patients or subjects pre versus post,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing that classified or characterized
cognitive performance or really even
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical change as a primary outcome,
and nothing that followed patients over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2014, I established the Marijuana
Investigations for Neuroscientific
[SPEAKER_00]: Discovery Program or the MIND Program at
McLean Hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really the first program of its
kind, and it's dedicated to looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term impact of medical cannabis use
on things like clinical state,
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive performance, sleep, quality of
life, conventional medication use,
[SPEAKER_00]: where applicable measures of brain
structure and function, and related
[SPEAKER_00]: measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much anything we can think of,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The program uses longitudinal,
observational, cross-sectional survey and
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trial models, and it supports
projects designed to examine custom
[SPEAKER_00]: formulated novel cannabinoid-based
therapies for a range of symptoms and
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We examine major and minor cannabinoids
and their impact on clinical and cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ultimate goal here really is to be
able to harness therapeutic potential
[SPEAKER_00]: while minimizing risk and harm related to
medical cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our very first longitudinal
observational study, again, longitudinal
[SPEAKER_00]: observational study, not a clinical trial,
observational study, was designed to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually set the stage for other types of
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this study really looked at clinical
state, cognitive performance, mood,
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep, conventional medication use,
all those things I just mentioned to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: in individuals who were interested in
using medical cannabis before they began
[SPEAKER_00]: their treatment measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are folks with various and sundry
indications and conditions who are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in exploring medical cannabis
use for whatever indication or condition
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd like, but we see them before they
begin using.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then follow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, we had very ambitious goals of
going out to almost one full year,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we thought was a lofty goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now extent that several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now follow patients out to three years
because generally once they're enrolled,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to stop, which is
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see them for a baseline visit before
they begin using, and we see them again at
[SPEAKER_00]: months three, six, 12, 15, 18,
24, and now 30 and 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also talk to them every month with
regard to their medical cannabis use and
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can use medical cannabis for any
indication or condition that they'd like,
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, sleep, mood, anything, and their
choice of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those products are ultimately assessed by
an outside laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: More on that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The assessments that they complete at each
of the time points, what I call the
[SPEAKER_00]: milestone study visits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, baseline three months,
six, 12, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: They consist of things like clinical
ratings where we're looking at pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: mood, anxiety, sleep, quality of life,
and anything else I can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very detailed information regarding their
medical cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really detailed, fine grained
information, individual level data on the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual products they're using,
product type, frequency, amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: source, cannabinoid constituents,
patient profile, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conventional medication use because we're
looking at potential change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measures of cognitive performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, when we can, a multimodal
neuroimaging protocol that allows me to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at their brain structure and function
and all sorts of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty comprehensive
longitudinal observational study.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to be considered eligible for
this study, people have to be over the age
[SPEAKER_00]: of 21 and have a valid certification for
medical cannabis use or plan to use
[SPEAKER_00]: products that don't require certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole landscape has shifted slightly
since the legalization for adult or
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back to the certifications,
they can be for a range of indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we didn't limit this first
study to any specific individual clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: cohort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't sure how many people we would
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be cannabis naive or have no
regular consistent use of cannabis over
[SPEAKER_00]: the past several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to be negative for THC at
baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had a group of control patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are individuals who have similar
conditions and indications as our medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cohort, but who are not
interested in using medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least when they sign up, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've lost several people in the treatment
as usual group to the actual treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: group over time, not surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2016, we published our first paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asked by a journal to get at least
10 patients from baseline to their first
[SPEAKER_00]: longitudinal assessment, which was three
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we published on 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we looked at these folks before
they began using medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: three months after they had been using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was really quite
striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found improvements on some measures of
executive function and clinical state and
[SPEAKER_00]: a reduction in their use of conventional
medication use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that these findings were so
important, at least in my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: was that again, we'd spent decades looking
at the impact of recreational cannabis use
[SPEAKER_00]: on target performance and clinical
measures and measures of brain structure
[SPEAKER_00]: and function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally our work and the work of
colleagues across the country and
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the globe had suggested that
individuals, especially those who began
[SPEAKER_00]: using early on in the developmental
trajectory when the brain is still
[SPEAKER_00]: vulnerable, had decrements in certain
aspects of cognitive performance,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, measures of executive
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't necessarily see those same
patterns of people who began using later,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very important distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so here's this first study of medical
cannabis patients over the course of three
[SPEAKER_00]: months showing no decrements in cognitive
performance, but improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we expanded that study and actually
ultimately and I should say that that
[SPEAKER_00]: first study got a ton of media attention
and I think it was in the top 5% of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the studies referenced in Altmetric.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published, I think in 2021,
on a cohort that we followed over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 54 patients followed over the
course of a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, before they began and then at
three, six and 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, what we found were
significant improvements on some measures
[SPEAKER_00]: of executive function and clinical state
over the course of their 12 months of
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found that measures of verbal
learning and memory generally remain
[SPEAKER_00]: stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no decrements.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, what we see in these
studies is no decrements in cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: performance or clinical state,
but improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this study has continued and now I'm
going to show you data from a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a data set of 67 medical
cannabis patients who completed a baseline
[SPEAKER_00]: and at least one follow-up study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see on the left-hand side of
the screen that these folks are about 46
[SPEAKER_00]: years of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say beyond the period of
neurodevelopmental vulnerability,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are not kids or emerging adults,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're predominantly Caucasian.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a higher than average IQ at
almost 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're well-educated, 16.54 years of
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a reminder, 16 years of education is
analogous to a college degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Duration of cannabis abstinence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been abstinent from cannabis
use on average for 20.3 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense since most of the time,
if these folks have had any history of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use, it's a remote history of use
in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or college.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they using cannabis for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they interested in using cannabis
for when they first enroll?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the top three indications really
echo what we see across this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top three spots in this country and
really every state generally fall between
[SPEAKER_00]: pain or anxiety as numbers one and two and
then sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this cohort, it's anxiety,
PTSD, then pain, then sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's mood and attention and other.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Inflammatory bowel disease, chronic
migraine headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we also have a pilot group
of treatment as usual patients with
[SPEAKER_00]: similar conditions, but who are not using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also looked at those folks over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of some of the assessments they
get, these are self-report rating scales
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of looking at mood, anxiety,
sleep, pain, and quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to just highlight what some
of these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the profile of mood state,
a really, really common measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are very, very common,
well-validated measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're looking at total mood
disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also do the back depression inventory,
very common measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of depressive symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anxiety, we have the back anxiety
inventory and the state trait anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sleep, our primary outcome measure is
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the PSQI.
[SPEAKER_00]: For pain, we're looking at the numeric
rating scale, the pain distress scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pain disability index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for quality of life, I'm going to show
you data on the who calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a subset of what's actually
administered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first taking a look at our cohort over
the course of one year in terms of mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see again, total mood disturbance
of the profile of mood state is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left and the back depression inventory is
on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overwhelmingly what we see is that
patients report significant improvements
[SPEAKER_00]: in mood-related symptoms between three and
12 months after initiating medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green line is our medical cannabis
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue line is our treatment as usual
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is a statistically
significant improvement at each time point
[SPEAKER_00]: for the MC patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not see this change in treatment as
usual patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true for the TMD and the BDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we turn to anxiety, which is a very
special area of focus and interest in my
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, we have the back anxiety
inventory on the left and the trait scale
[SPEAKER_00]: of the STAI on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients once again, report statistically
significant improvements in symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety between baseline three,
six, and 12 months of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The treatment as usual folks, those folks
on the blue line, that's the blue line
[SPEAKER_00]: there, do not demonstrate the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same pattern, no improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at sleep, patients are generally
reporting improved sleep quality between
[SPEAKER_00]: three and 12 months after initiating
medical cannabis use a statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant improvement at each of the
time points in the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patient group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not see the same in the treatment as
usual group.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a subset of patients, these are folks
who are using medical cannabis exclusively
[SPEAKER_00]: for chronic pain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see here is over the course of
three to six months, patients with chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain report significantly decreased
ratings of pain on the numeric rating
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, the pain distress scale,
and the pain disability index across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the green line is the patients,
blue are the treatment as usual folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistically significant improvements
over the course of a year in the MC
[SPEAKER_00]: patients that we don't see in the
treatment as usual folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sensing a theme?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, with regard to quality of life,
and this is the hook fall, physical health
[SPEAKER_00]: on the left and psychological health on
the right, what we see are significant
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements on some aspects of quality of
life, specifically here for physical and
[SPEAKER_00]: psychological health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually didn't see any change in
social relationships or the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: subscale scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those remain pretty stable over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for psychological and physical health,
we do see a statistically significant
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement over the course of one year of
medical cannabis treatment in the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: group, not in the treatment as usual
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fantastic to see that overall
people are getting better, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly raises the question,
what's in your weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What might account for the improvement and
how can we find out what's in your weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we best do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I turned back to my
extraordinary lab and we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a step-by-step metric that really
quantifies estimated maximum possible
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Cannacount and it's an
improved metric for quantifying estimates
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoid exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The increasing array of cannabinoid-based
products contain various amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabinoids and other
constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Existing methods are pretty limited
though, and none at all account for actual
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid content of the products that
patients or consumers are actually using.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created something.
[SPEAKER_00]: This metric basically considers things
like the actual individual cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents, frequency and duration of
use, the amount used, and the route of
[SPEAKER_00]: administration or mode of use.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things are incredibly
important in figuring out what's in your
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and what might people be exposed to
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a slide showing cannabinoid
constituent information and how you get
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right side, what you see is
laboratory analysis that breaks down,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, a cannabinoid constituent profile,
how much of each of the constituents is
[SPEAKER_00]: found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical cannabis product samples are
basically sent to a third-party lab for
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of profiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it quantifies the amount of
individual cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If actual product samples are not
available for testing or if patients are
[SPEAKER_00]: unwilling to part with even a tiny amount
for testing, which so far has not been a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, thank goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rely on dispensary or supplier
certificates of analysis if you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can use product labels,
not preferred given the very known and
[SPEAKER_00]: very obvious issues with product labeling
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you really want is to get a sample of
the actual products that patients are
[SPEAKER_00]: using and have an outside lab analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an overview of Cannacount, and I won't
belabor this too much, you can pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really helpful step-by-step
guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we're querying patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use this with recreational
consumers as well for people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're asking questions about product
type, frequency, amount or magnitude use,
[SPEAKER_00]: and duration of use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, then we get this laboratory
assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We organize the data and then convert the
data into what I would call preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: units for the calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might convert, for example,
things like percentage to milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: gram or milliliters to gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also account for conversion of the acid
form to the active form.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We calculate exposure generally in two
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use one or both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the discrete use approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients report frequency and amount of
the products used each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much and how often they're using each
individual product or they can report the
[SPEAKER_00]: total amount of a product used over a
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I might say to a patient,
you bought three and a half grams of X
[SPEAKER_00]: flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did it take for you to go through
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you use it, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannacount, this metric can actually be
used to estimate exposure to any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid, not just THC and CBD,
which most people spend a lot of time on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the minors as well, as long as the
cannabinoid content is known and derived
[SPEAKER_00]: from what I would call a reliable source.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a quick slide that shows you
how you calculate exposure for the
[SPEAKER_00]: discrete use approach versus the total use
approach, but this is all detailed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this is just a way of getting to
what I want to show you, which is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in your wheat factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you can actually sum
cannabinoid exposure for each route of
[SPEAKER_00]: administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you have folks who are using
routes of inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smoking and they're vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also sum, for example,
anything that was an oral administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have asked us whether they can sum
exposure across product types.
[SPEAKER_00]: You certainly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily recommend it because
it doesn't account for different
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailability across product type and
route of administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ways in which we use these products
and individual product types are not all
[SPEAKER_00]: created equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back to our own sample of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bar graph that basically
illustrates exposure to delta-9-THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is the dark green and CBD is the minty
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see immediately is that between
baseline in three and baseline in six
[SPEAKER_00]: months, our patients are being exposed to
significantly more CBD than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is perhaps not surprising because
generally, our patients are very clear on
[SPEAKER_00]: not wanting to be high or altered.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, what they say is, Dr. Gruber,
I don't want to be messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be checked out during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a job to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to be able to sleep through
the night or I just want to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a walk with my husband or remember my
kid's birthday or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not looking to be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very often, they're choosing products that
have an array of non-intoxicating
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, very often rich in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: To examine the unique contributions of THC
and CBD, we actually conducted and
[SPEAKER_00]: examined correlations between these
cannabinoids and outcome variables,
[SPEAKER_00]: so clinical measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative to baseline, only three months of
medical cannabis treatment, higher THC
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure was actually related to
improvements in pain severity as measured
[SPEAKER_00]: on the visual analog scale and the numeric
rating scale and pain-related distress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that in these graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher THC exposure and greater
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't see any relationship between
higher THC exposure and mood or anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens at six months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative to baseline, at six months,
of medical cannabis treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC exposure is no longer related to any
measure of pain or mood or anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw it at three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't see it at six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really interesting, especially
when we consider what's coming next.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to CBD or cannabidiol,
relative to baseline, after three months
[SPEAKER_00]: of medical cannabis treatment,
higher CBD exposure was actually related
[SPEAKER_00]: to improvements in mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this in the POMS Total Mood
Disturbance Score, the Beck Depression
[SPEAKER_00]: Inventory, and anxiety measures,
so both the trait and the state measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see it in terms of improvement on
disability caused by pain, so the pain
[SPEAKER_00]: disability index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's three months of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: At six months of treatment, now what we
see is higher CBD exposure continues to be
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with all of those measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the total mood disturbance and BDI
and the anxiety and PDI scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher CBD, greater improvement on all of
those measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we also have an association with
improvements in pain severity,
[SPEAKER_00]: as measured by the numeric rating scale,
and pain-related distress.
[SPEAKER_00]: At six months, we see the same
improvements with CBD on mood and anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: and pain, pain distress, and now we're
seeing pain severity and pain distress
[SPEAKER_00]: also improving with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I probably don't have to explain to
this audience, given some of our esteemed
[SPEAKER_00]: folks in the audience, I'm sure,
minor cannabinoids often exert a major
[SPEAKER_00]: impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we need more work in this area,
we certainly have a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence suggesting that some of the
so-called minor cannabinoids, termed only
[SPEAKER_00]: minor because of the amount in which they
are present in chemomars, they can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: major therapeutic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, cannabigerol or CBG has been
shown to exhibit anti-tumor, antioxidant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and anti-inflammatory properties,
and is often touted as being neurogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabichromine or CBC, hypothesized to
have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial,
[SPEAKER_00]: and antifungal effects, and also shown to
increase viability of adult neural stem
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerator cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCV or tetrahydrocannabinol, shown to
inhibit some of the negative cognitive and
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologic effects related to THC
administration, and may also be
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the beginning, so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, what about the minors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we look at the minor
cannabinoid exposure in our population,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we see is certainly a range across
the board with CBG and the acid form,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBN, CBC, and THCV, but it raises the
question of what's in their read,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did an analysis of all the products
submitted by our patients to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of minors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found, this is all of the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me be clear, not just the minors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is everything, and I'm going to pull
out the minors.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, when we consider all
of the constituents, 82 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: products submitted had detectable CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost 71 percent had detectable Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, right after that, the next step,
cannabigerol or CBG at 58.8 percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabichromine, CBC, at 54.9 percent,
so well over 50 percent for those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, you have the acid form of CBD,
you have CBN or cannabinol, THCV,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very interesting in terms of what's
in these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: In more than 50 percent of the samples,
we found CBG and CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We conducted preliminary analyses to look
at the potential relationship between
[SPEAKER_00]: these two cannabinoids and any potential
change in clinical outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What domains are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, pain, mood, and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased exposure to CBG and CBC were
both associated with lower distress
[SPEAKER_00]: related to pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look on the left, that's CBG and
the pain distress scale on the left-hand
[SPEAKER_00]: side, significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right-hand side, that's CBC and the
pain distress scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not necessarily seeing relationships
between CBG and CBC and actual mood and
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no relationships that we found in
this preliminary analysis between CBG or
[SPEAKER_00]: CBC and any specific mood or anxiety
measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we're seeing lower distress
related to pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me summarize what we see so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a longitudinal observational sample of
medical cannabis patients, the clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: data are clearly showing areas of
significant improvement between three and
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 months of treatment after initiating
their medical cannabis regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing improvements in measures of
mood, anxiety, sleep, pain, and quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their treatment regimens contain vastly
greater amounts of CBD relative to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get that by using this great metric,
CanAccount, and actually quantifying
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure to individual cannabinoids over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not taking their word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually quantifying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accurate estimates of cannabinoid exposure
using CanAccount or this metric will help
[SPEAKER_00]: clarify the impact of cannabinoids on
treatment outcomes and hopefully generate
[SPEAKER_00]: more accurate risk benefit ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're desperately in need of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need something to help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also saw improvements related to THC
and CBD exposure that were very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we considered pain, we saw reductions
in pain associated with higher THC
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure at three months, but we did not
see that same relationship at six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: only at three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most associations between pain and CBD
exposure were noted at six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to CBD, we did see
improvements in anxiety and mood with
[SPEAKER_00]: higher CBD exposure at both three and six
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different responses to these two
primary cannabinoids when we think about
[SPEAKER_00]: them before we get to the minors.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we consider the minors, we saw that
the products that are being used by our
[SPEAKER_00]: patients do contain a range of minor
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 50% of all products analyzed
contained CBG or CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see significant relationships
between the minor cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: measures of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, for CBG and CBD,
CBC exposure, we saw a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: association with reduced pain related
distress, pain related distress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, we need additional studies that
look at specific relationships between the
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called minor cannabinoids and the major
clinical impact they may have and what
[SPEAKER_00]: subtle nuances they may actually confer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, pain related distress is not
necessarily the same as pain reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really interesting and important
area of investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, I just want to touch on mindful
activities and the fact that we do a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of custom formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently conceptualizing and
formulating a number of additional
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid blends optimized to treat
various conditions and indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are whole plant, derive full and
broad spectrum products, hemp and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they create study products that
are high in cannabinoids that are
[SPEAKER_00]: typically considered minor, but which
demonstrate tremendous clinical potential
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for some of these studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're interested in examining the impact
of terpenoids on a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: bio-behavioral measures as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes, of course, are the essential
oils that give cannabis its characteristic
[SPEAKER_00]: scent and flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither THC nor CBD have a scent profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They themselves have their own
bio-behavioral health effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually currently optimizing some
terpenes to ultimately address specific
[SPEAKER_00]: indications and conditions, which are
really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of clinical trials
designed to assess efficacy and safety of
[SPEAKER_00]: custom formulated full and broad spectrum
products and a number of INDs or
[SPEAKER_00]: investigational new drug approvals in
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very, very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at moderate to severe
anxiety and a number of cohorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anxiety and agitation and Alzheimer's
related dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mood and anxiety in patients with bipolar
disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kicking off this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anxiety and pain in patients with
glioblastoma with a very exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: exploratory aim of potentially slowing
tumor growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we now have a new study focused
on chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually taken a fair amount of
work in terms of optimizing some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: lesser known cannabinoids or terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to considering THC and CBD
content, again, we're optimizing products
[SPEAKER_00]: with regard to the minors and their
terpenoid contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would conclude by saying we have an
unprecedented opportunity to customize and
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize cannabinoid-based treatments for
our patients, which has the potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: transform patient care and medicine as we
know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By harnessing therapeutic benefits of
cannabis while also mitigating potential
[SPEAKER_00]: risk and harm, cannabinoid-based
treatments may very well be the answer for
[SPEAKER_00]: countless individuals for whom
conventional medication doesn't provide
[SPEAKER_00]: adequate symptom relief or produces
unwanted side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those things, unfortunately,
result in lower rates of compliance in our
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical cohorts, so we have to do
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this, I would thank you for your time
and tell you that I couldn't do any of
[SPEAKER_00]: this work without my extraordinary team,
I mean extraordinary team, as well as my
[SPEAKER_00]: various team collaborators, and tell you
that if you have any questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be delighted to answer them.

.edu.

[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of exciting things, so much to be
excited about.

conference.

experience, and I wish you all the very
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
