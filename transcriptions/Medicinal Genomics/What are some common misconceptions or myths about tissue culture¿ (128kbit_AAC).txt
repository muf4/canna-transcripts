[SPEAKER_01]: What are some common misconceptions or
myths about tissue culture that you'd like
[SPEAKER_01]: to debunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm not sure if they're common
myths or the like, but there's several
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that the clients always come to
me when I'm discussing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if it's a myth or if I'm
just getting a small sample size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the concerns that I've had several
growers, specifically because of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory threats, they were concerned,
okay, so once we start doing this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing all the science things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I going to be sure that when I give
you these plants, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, they're hemp right now, but what if
they go hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, do they have a history of
going hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it's less than like,
it's less than 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, are you going to make it into
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like some of these things that I don't
think several people understand is when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing tissue culture, you're making
an exact clone of the mother, the donor
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, unless you're doing genetic
modification, specifically, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: another step.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just clone that process,
it's whatever genetics it has is what the
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter is going to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it's not going to suddenly like,
it's not a like 0.02% THC plant is not
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly going to go 20% just because it
crossed the threshold of my door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless we do a lot of extra heavy
lifting to like insert things,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is that they have a lot of
questions is whether or not it will impact
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers organic certifications,
which it's not necessarily like a science
[SPEAKER_00]: myth, but it's like, it's something that
is very much so of interest to the client.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is organic or not is a government
regulation and tissue culture does not
[SPEAKER_00]: impact your organic certifications at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's apples to aircraft carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it would have no more impact on
your organic certifications on whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not you used an electronic vehicle to
transport your cannabis versus like a gas
[SPEAKER_00]: powered vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, we don't, it doesn't,
the regulations don't apply to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we're doing, we're only like,
we only have the genetic expressions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that we begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the daughter is the exact,
it's an exact clone of the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, if, you know, once I hand it to
you, if you continue to do your organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, I haven't messed up with any of
your, those are the two that I always get
[SPEAKER_00]: asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if they're myths,
but it's like questions that the clients
[SPEAKER_00]: always have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'd bring it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
