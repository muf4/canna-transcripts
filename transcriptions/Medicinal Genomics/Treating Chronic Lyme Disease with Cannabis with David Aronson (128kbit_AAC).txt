[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't have much for updates this
episode other than to tell you that our
[SPEAKER_00]: team is working hard on finalizing the
details for CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have some I's to dot and T's to
cross before we can make our public
[SPEAKER_00]: announcement, but let's just say,
keep your schedule clear for mid-June.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also aiming to add our CanMed 24
presentations to the CanMed archive by the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We apologize for the delay on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still have five years worth of
CanMed content in the archive now,
[SPEAKER_00]: so feel free to check out those videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the past episodes of the CanMed
Coffee Talk podcast at CanMedEvents.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you're there, make sure to sign
up for email alerts so you don't miss any
[SPEAKER_00]: announcements.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is David Aronson.
[SPEAKER_00]: David is a cannabis educator who,
since 2018, has directly educated more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 5,000 healthcare professionals
nationwide on the medical applications of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is on the faculty for PESI,
one of the nation's largest providers of
[SPEAKER_00]: professional continuing education,
and he independently provides seminars for
[SPEAKER_00]: health professionals around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned during our conversation that
David also has post-treatment Lyme
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, which is a condition that causes
fatigue, neuropathic pain, brain fog,
[SPEAKER_00]: forgetfulness, and other chronic symptoms
that he treats with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: His experience made him curious whether
others have found success using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat persistent Lyme and has shared
his findings at CanMed 24 as a poster
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation and also with me in the
conversation you're about to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered what is Lyme disease and how
does one acquire it, the different stages
[SPEAKER_00]: of Lyme disease, treatments that are
available to treat chronic Lyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: how David collected data for the study,
and which types of products are effective
[SPEAKER_00]: for chronic Lyme symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
David, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, McKinney RSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: McKinney RSA is made up of regulatory
science veterans who apply lessons learned
[SPEAKER_00]: in the nicotine space to help cannabis
manufacturers better understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicological and societal implications of
their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do that by identifying base
compounds, extracts, flavors, and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, understanding how they interact,
and ensuring effectiveness for the
[SPEAKER_00]: intended use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also provide dosing recommendations
and establish guidelines for product
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn more at McKinneyRSA.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with David
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaronson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm excited to talk with you today
about using cannabis to potentially treat
[SPEAKER_00]: persistent and post-treatment Lyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a timely topic for me because
I actually found a deer tick on my torso a
[SPEAKER_00]: few weeks back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, I caught it early and took a
prophylactic dose of antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hopeful that I prevented an
infection, but maybe we can get into that
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, Lyme disease has at
least been on my mind recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy that I've had a chance to
talk with you about it here today and
[SPEAKER_00]: about whether cannabis can be used to
treat long-term cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into all that,
I think it would be helpful to establish
[SPEAKER_00]: the basics of what Lyme disease is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could you do that for us?
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when first defining something
important to note.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Lyme disease is a bacterial infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis is not going to cure Lyme
disease at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at it as a symptomatic and
palliative treatment for the illness
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's so many symptoms and so
many side effects from treatments and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very helpful in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Lyme is a bacterial infection that is
transmitted primarily by ticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ticks, deer ticks primarily,
although they're found in other types of
[SPEAKER_02]: ticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's black-legged ticks in the northern
latitudes and in the western part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: country, too, like in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: There aren't deer ticks, but they also
carry Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're also finding it in lone star
ticks and dog ticks and wood ticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be found in any kind of tick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just most commonly in the deer tick
because the way the life cycle works,
[SPEAKER_02]: they contracted from mice, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just regular old mice are the reservoir
for Lyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the baby ticks pick it up from
that and they can give it to deer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they get on the deer and they
fall off deer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they often find us or they find
us before the deer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, there are other ticks and
they all carry lots of different presence
[SPEAKER_02]: for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just Lyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having only Lyme disease is often an
exception to the rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I would encourage you to do is
just ask for a follow-up test for a full
[SPEAKER_02]: panel of the other stuff if you at all
feel unwell in the next few weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's about a dozen things that
they carry that they can pass on to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very common for people who have
two or three infections at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a special kind of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a spirochete, much like syphilis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a little corkscrew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it really gets into cells and into
tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it can hide really well from our
immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can even hang on to white blood cells
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then not only that, but it can change
shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's been in the body for a long
time and well-established, there's enough
[SPEAKER_02]: of them when they're exposed to one type
of antibiotic, they'll actually change
[SPEAKER_02]: into a different type of bacteria that's
not susceptible to that type of antibiotic
[SPEAKER_02]: until it's gone and they'll change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a nutty thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very advanced and it's hard to
treat once it becomes systemic in the
[SPEAKER_02]: body.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you catch it very early,
then just a few rounds of doxycycline is
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much all it takes for most people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it persists, it can persist into,
and tell me how much you read,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 to 20% of people can end up having
chronic conditions, either from a
[SPEAKER_02]: continuing infection or from damage done
by the illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is sort of like, I guess this is
more of a personal question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is sort of the timeline from,
you know, you have to bite till you're
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing symptoms?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three basic stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the initial stage is flu-like symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people feel pretty sick right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason I became so interested in
this is I had a really bad case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I first had it, I definitely
had a summer flu that didn't go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went and saw the doctor and she gave
me a Lyme test, which she said,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to come back in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are very often wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple of weeks later, I felt a lot
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said it was negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never went back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really should have gone back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something to be aware of is that
the testing is terrible for Lyme disease
[SPEAKER_02]: in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a little better, but it's a hard
thing to detect in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't culture it or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking for antibodies that can be
hard to detect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so did you ever find a tick or
anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a scar from it and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what happened to me was I found it
the day it bit me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't have a tick scoop or a pair
of tweezers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did what my dad did for me as a kid,
which is definitely you're not supposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: do, is I heated a paperclip, red hot,
and I killed the tick while it was on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what that does is make it regurgitate
everything into you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I almost guarantee an infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had pieces of it in me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to dig it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they laid dormant for many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was such a subacute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I either got bitten again or it
was also at the same time as a major life
[SPEAKER_02]: stressor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I became I had major neurological
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so the symptoms you experienced was
well after that initial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I had that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had this like weird back pain
for somebody in their 20s for many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like I said, a major life
stressor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lost in the family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden I started going numb
from my feet up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then having all sorts of weird like
getting lost on the way home from work and
[SPEAKER_02]: all sorts of really unpleasant things,
lots of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took a long time to get the right
diagnosis.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we sort of touched on it there,
like the different stages, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second stage is when it becomes kind of
more disseminated in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it starts like joint pain and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third stage is in the nervous
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when it becomes much harder to
treat because the typical courses of
[SPEAKER_02]: antibiotics generally aren't effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually IV antibiotics are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prior to that sort of last stage,
like a course of antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it might need to be for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there are multiple infections that
have gotten out there, then you might need
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple types of antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the diagnosis is one thing,
but then the treatment side of things is a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole other kind of mess, honestly,
because there's no established protocol
[SPEAKER_02]: for these multiple infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so everybody's got their own way of
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody thinks they're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're probably right for some people
and not for others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets to be a tricky thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it's not covered assurance,
and it gets really messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is it also an issue, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could get rid of the bacteria,
but there's lasting effects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where I'm at at this point in my
life, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got peripheral neuropathy now from
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an immune deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely don't have Lyme disease
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have a lot of symptoms of without a
better explanation might start to look
[SPEAKER_02]: like MS.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as long as I take good care of myself,
I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're telling me is I should call
my doctor and get more antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would all feel unwell in the next
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we touched on how people acquire
it, what the different stages are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We briefly touched about different
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that a rabbit hole that we can go
down?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bit of a rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would suggest when people get Lyme
disease and the initial treatment isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: enough, then a great thing to do is
there's a few resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is to look up your local Lyme,
especially if you're in a major urban area
[SPEAKER_02]: or a largely populated state, there's
going to be Lyme disease support groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: You contact them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say, I'm really sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: My initial treatment is not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for names of doctors who
specialize in treating Lyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it really is a specialty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Lyme literate is a term to
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for a Lyme literate physician.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another organization called ILADS.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called International Lyme and
Associated Disease Society.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really have established a protocol
for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where your Lyme literate
physicians get their training from.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to their website and do a
search for doctors trained in your area
[SPEAKER_02]: and find somebody to talk to most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people will not be accepting
insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good rule of thumb is to get a good
quality rule out if you're sick and you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to know if you truly have Lyme
disease or not, you'd probably expect to
[SPEAKER_02]: spend somewhere around $1,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to find out if you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about spending the doctor
$200 an hour for their time and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: testing is generally out of pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the testing would be from those Lyme
literate physicians?
[SPEAKER_02]: They would draw the labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I told you the testing is so bad,
the standardized tests, there's labs that
[SPEAKER_02]: are fully accredited and good labs,
but they're not insurance covered
[SPEAKER_02]: generally because they do their own
assays.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do a good job and that's usually
where these doctors will send the tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to imagine too, at least from my
own experience with finding the deer tick,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think they describe it's like
the size of a sesame seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the nips can be that small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine that, you know, like perhaps
in your case too, where you have some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that summer flu or something or that,
you know, that sickness that you just
[SPEAKER_00]: can't kick and, you know, attributed to,
oh, it's a virus or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it really could have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people don't know that my dad
almost died last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in the emergency room in and out
for three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't know what was wrong with him
and he kept getting fevers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his organs were failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I showed up and I said, have you
tested for ticks?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they went, what do you do for a
living?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, never you mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they gave him antibiotics and he
bounced right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that didn't develop into some sort
of persistent condition?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because it was a rare kind of case
where it hit him hard and fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was anaplasmosis that was really
tanking him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happens sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's old, he's 80.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, sometimes that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fevers of like 104.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's up there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your study looked particularly at
persistent and post-treatment Lyme
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we call it that because in the,
from our, so a couple of things,
[SPEAKER_02]: one is I didn't want to elude to the fact
that one should treat acute, like acute
[SPEAKER_02]: case with just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also in the data set, these are people
that are, are filling out a form saying I
[SPEAKER_02]: have Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what stage they're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so it's, that's seemed like a large
enough grouping.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of safe to assume that,
that they're either treating persistent
[SPEAKER_02]: cases or post-treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's no reason that some of them
couldn't have been acute, but it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: unlikely if they're just in that short
treatment window of two weeks on
[SPEAKER_02]: doxycycline that they would enter this
world of treating it with cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The symptoms that we're tracking,
like anxiety, inflammatory pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: sleep, those kinds of things are common in
the later stages of Lyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, if you're treating it with
cannabis, you've probably already been
[SPEAKER_02]: through the standard route.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are, those are assumptions,
but we can't interview these, these
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really just looking at,
they say they have Lyme and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: treating X symptom and the tool helps them
rate it on different scales.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's interesting now is as ubiquitous
as Lyme is, as much as cannabis is being
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at, nobody had ever looked at these
two together before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you, which is really surprising,
because if you do just a simple Google
[SPEAKER_02]: search, there's a lot where every
dispensary is telling you you should treat
[SPEAKER_02]: your Lyme disease with cannabis and lots
of, lots of doctors' websites have blog
[SPEAKER_02]: posts about using cannabis to help with
Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of Lyme blogs and Lyme
information websites tell you CBD and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis are good symptomatic treatments,
but absolutely nobody has done any
[SPEAKER_02]: academic or formal look at it until now,
which is really weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're doing a retrospective sort of
naturalistic study and we're continuing to
[SPEAKER_02]: examine more symptoms and kind of parse
out the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it really is effective and it's
interesting that it affects people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the things that Lyme, people,
sorry, Lyme disease is often a root cause
[SPEAKER_02]: of things like rheumatoid, ALS,
it can be mistaken for Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_02]: For lupus, fibromyalgia, these are all
things people commonly use cannabis to
[SPEAKER_02]: treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very, so, and they're not always caused
by Lyme, but Lyme is one of the potential
[SPEAKER_02]: causes of these syndromes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was very interesting to me
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we found though, is that
people who like use it for arthritic,
[SPEAKER_02]: for inflammatory pain, if they have Lyme
respond differently than people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: using it for inflammatory pain who don't
have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: How so?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like higher THC formulations were found
more relieving for anxiety than mixed
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid ratios in people with Lyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas when we look at overall on the
other ends, it's usually the other way
[SPEAKER_02]: around, like a one-to-one or a higher CBD
ratio formula will be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better for Lyme?
[SPEAKER_02]: For anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the THC is more helpful for Lyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's better relieving
inflammation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a sense, or, and so it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot, I mean, when we talk
about the data, there's a lot I can say
[SPEAKER_02]: about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, first of all, you know,
where are you getting this data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how, where's it coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a great app and website called
StrainPrint, StrainPrint.ca.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Canadian company, but they also
track a fair amount of American products
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really great, um, uh,
use tracking tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, um, and I, so I suggest to people
regardless, because it's helpful because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you might say, say you use,
you use and you find, oh, my pain's
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really, but it also then will ask
you, are you feeling tired?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you feeling, um, you know,
a little irritable or upset stomach?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it helps you note side effects as well
and help dial in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of helped dial in your dosing
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it asks people to, to identify
their disease or diagnosis, and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: will give a list of symptoms commonly
associated with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you can also choose your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tracks up to like 70 different
symptoms, a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, uh, you rate it,
how you're feeling on a scale one to 10
[SPEAKER_02]: before you put in what you took and then,
and then rate after.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's got for, if you're in Canada,
for example, all the products and
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries are loaded into that app.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it tracks all the testing data and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's also useful for producers and,
and looking and studies to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what cannabinoid ratio might be
good for this salmon and that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that that's a, it's interesting that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're able to track a lot of different,
uh, ratios of, uh, products that people
[SPEAKER_02]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and in this one, we were down to like
the batch level too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a company that's regularly
submitting their stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, it's, it's useful in oh,
so many ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the, the, um, we looked at a
combined of inhaled and edible products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of put it all in one,
but it would be interesting to parse that
[SPEAKER_02]: out in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we looked at a range of
cannabinoid ratios of including THC only
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD only, and then naturalistic ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might in the data, you might see
like a 25 to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's a very high THC,
um, cannabis, but it's, it's still a
[SPEAKER_02]: naturalistic ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got some measurable amount of THC
or CBD and other cannabinoids in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're really just looking at THC and
CBD as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which is something I think is often
not enough, but it's more often than not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, and going all the way down
one to one and on the other end of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and what we found in this data set was
there was an overwhelming preference for
[SPEAKER_02]: THC, very, very strong preference and,
and very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the THC only, I note that to a product
availability, um, what's, what's pushed in
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries, you know, there's a higher
margin in distillate and, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, for some, in some ways sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and then the convenience factor,
uh, there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then that's also primarily what's
in edibles, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They use distillate and edibles as well,
because then they can have an even measure
[SPEAKER_02]: of dosage, even though it may not be the
best delivery method.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while that was used the most often,
not in every case, was it the most
[SPEAKER_02]: preferred, but it always scored very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but when you, when you look at other
ones, what often score equally high,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and, uh, or better with less dosages,
um, uh, was naturalistic ratios or a one
[SPEAKER_02]: to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, CBD only often also didn't perform
very well in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then what we found was we also looked
at gender differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was really fascinating here was,
um, so for pain, um, I just, I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure I get it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found in anxiety, um, like I said,
uh, THC only, um, performed, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: really high, um, among, uh, they performed
better for, for women.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it did for, uh, for men, which was
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, uh, for then it,
then the CBD did, um, and then it was
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhat reversed for the inflammatory
pain where men found it, uh, found a
[SPEAKER_02]: better, uh, result and efficacy from
higher CBD than THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And women found higher THC more efficacy
inflammation too, which is, so that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't say anything in particular other
than it's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important that we continue to
examine gender differences because there,
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever we do, there are, um,
I believe it's, it's been a long time
[SPEAKER_02]: since I looked at what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, um, there's a study that looked
at, uh, blood levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and women have, will yield higher
levels of THC from equal dosages often in
[SPEAKER_02]: their blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there, so there's, it's just really
important that we look at those
[SPEAKER_02]: differences so that we can better
understand how to help people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, so if you had somebody
with high anxiety, you might not suggest
[SPEAKER_02]: that they use a high THC product,
but with this data, you could,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could feel better about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or when they're telling you that that's
what they're using, you might not say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sorry to circle back, but I believe
you were saying that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of these symptoms are
similar to other conditions like
[SPEAKER_00]: fibromyalgia or, you know, inflammation
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was effective for you know,
for that versus what's effective for Lyme
[SPEAKER_00]: was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, if, if someone is at the stage
where it's sort of more persistent Lyme
[SPEAKER_00]: and that may have been, uh, undiagnosed
before, is that something that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: get tested for to kind of get a better?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, you know, anybody, so I,
um, I've been a therapist for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's how I kind of, I know
that's why I got into the education of
[SPEAKER_02]: this because I realized as I was sick that
I had, I know I had seen so many people
[SPEAKER_02]: that had had this because there's really
strong psychiatric presentations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whenever somebody, if somebody gets
this far along into it, they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have anxiety or insomnia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depression is very, very common in Lyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, there's a guy out of Columbia,
Brian Fallon, who has done studies where
[SPEAKER_02]: he draws a causative link to Lyme,
which is a pretty daring thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's any time people have a kind of
persistent mental health disorder with a,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, not clearly diagnosed or, or a
syndrome type illness that's chronic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, and especially if you live in the
Northeast or spend a lot of time there,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's worth checking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, and, uh, and that,
that can be a challenge to get people to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tie is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's changing slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it is looked at more and more,
especially up in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, so once people kind of get to
this persistent or post treatment stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it then just all about managing
symptoms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's, it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people get a lot better, um,
when they, they take antibiotics and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and, but there's a way that the
illness works, that there's a stage in
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment where, um, and it waxes away,
it cycles where you, it precipitates
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms and you feel a lot worse for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then before you feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the length of time that goes on is
different for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people get, um, get really
discouraged and don't continue their
[SPEAKER_02]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so really there, and some people
can't don't get any better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people hit a wall and they,
they don't get any better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or there are certain things they could
do that they don't do, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like major diet changes and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it is really, really variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all I can say is it's a,
it's all very, um, individualized
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment, um, which is one of the reasons
cannabis is so helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so like, before I was diagnosed,
um, you know, I, I would use cannabis for
[SPEAKER_02]: the thing that we would always use
cannabis for you and to have fun,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and relax and unwind and help you
sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, when, uh, when I was diagnosed,
I was taking you know, prescriptions for
[SPEAKER_02]: pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nerve pain is terribly hard to treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was taking, uh, prescriptions for sleep
and, and, uh, uh, things to help me stay
[SPEAKER_02]: awake.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really awful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, cause I'd be, I'd be the
basically falling asleep during the day
[SPEAKER_02]: and unable to sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I, when I understood that I had
Lyme disease, I stopped taking all those
[SPEAKER_02]: things and I was able to manage all of my
symptoms, uh, with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and I would say I was able to,
I was able to get through all that
[SPEAKER_02]: antibiotic treatment, you know,
the nausea and the, the, the, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can really cause, you know,
low mood and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to get through all that and
manage that really well with, with using
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that, um, you know, a combination
THC CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, I, for me it was, it's,
it was pretty much high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used a lot of high CBD flour and a lot
of high THC flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I am not able to use edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of those people that I could eat
and nothing happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that is generally the best for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although when you have a lot of
medications, that's one of the good things
[SPEAKER_02]: about cannabis is you can use it in a
method that's not going to try cause,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, dangerous drug interactions by
inhaling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you bypass the liver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's one of the good advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, it really, it managed pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helped me sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it can, uh, help, um, you know,
lower immune inflammation without lowering
[SPEAKER_02]: your immunity because steroid treatments
when you have an infection aren't an
[SPEAKER_02]: option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a, it really fills in a lot of
gaps for people with this kind of chronic
[SPEAKER_02]: illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true for cannabis in general,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very useful for sort of these tough
to treat, um, diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's, and you know, in my,
I do a lot of education for health
[SPEAKER_02]: professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what I always start by saying is
it doesn't cure anything, but it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just a, one of the best symptomatic
treatments for almost everything in many
[SPEAKER_02]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, David, winding down here,
um, any sort of closing thoughts or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: things we didn't cover with respect to
Lyme or, or the data that I would say look
[SPEAKER_02]: for more, um, uh, myself and the person
David, David Berg that runs Strain Print.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be examining more symptoms
and, and, uh, we're looking for academic
[SPEAKER_02]: partners to help publish this stuff in the
literature beyond, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: posters at conferences, but I'll be at
more conferences with my posters as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the cannabis clinicians conference
in October in Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, the Strain Print database,
is that something that's publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: available or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the database is not publicly
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: The app is, um, and, and you can certainly
contact David Berg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he loves working with people and
sharing the data and, um, and finding ways
[SPEAKER_02]: to get it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I encourage anybody that's interested
in looking deeper at the data and finding
[SPEAKER_02]: out if it can help them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: To, uh, contact David Berg or myself and,
um, or go through the StrainPrint.ca,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's a, it's a great tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the largest databases of
naturalistic, uh, cannabis data.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got like, I, so remember I said
nothing had ever been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I asked him, he said, do you have
any, uh, any numbers of people diagnosed
[SPEAKER_02]: with Lyme?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, uh, like 5,000 over five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: 5,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, the N on this, on these,
or over 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so this is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's like over 2 million data
points and he's like 80,000 something
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that sounds like a great resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to love to talk with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to have them out at Canva next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should, you should give them,
you should give them a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thanks so much for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, definitely put some links in the show
notes for people to learn more about your
[SPEAKER_00]: work and the other resources that you
shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send you, I'll send you some
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and like I said, hope to see you down
in, uh, in Canva again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
