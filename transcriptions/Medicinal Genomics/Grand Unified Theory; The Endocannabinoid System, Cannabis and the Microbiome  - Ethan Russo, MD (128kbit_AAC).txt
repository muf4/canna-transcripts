[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to be here, especially to
follow Rafi, my mentor and surrogate
[SPEAKER_00]: uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this slide, you'll see my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to hear from you afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of this talk is contained in an
article that was just published last week
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'd be happy to send to each of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I am on the high wire without a
net trying to do an hour presentation in
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some disparate threads here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to tie together and hope that it
becomes coherent at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human gut harbors 100 trillion
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are 10 to the 12th per
milliliter of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their genome exceeds that of the host
human's 100-fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference in obese humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more of a type of bacteria
called bacteroidatitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fellow, Dr. Moller, did a very
interesting study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually went and sampled in the
field fecal samples from wild chimps,
[SPEAKER_00]: bonobos, which are pygmy chimps,
our closest genetic relatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: gorillas, and human populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbiomes of American humans are
more different from those of Malawi humans
[SPEAKER_00]: than the gut microbiomes of Malawi humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malawi humans are from bonobos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the p-value there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never see values like this unless it
is a clear finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at three different continents in
humans, there were lower microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity than in apes with respect to the
bacterial phyla, classes, orders,
[SPEAKER_00]: families, and genera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a constriction of the diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans average 30 fewer bacterial
genera, the lowest level of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These changes have been associated
historically, epidemiologically,
[SPEAKER_00]: with vast increases in gastrointestinal
disorders, obesity, and especially
[SPEAKER_00]: autoimmune disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same group did a subsequent study,
again, showing that there are also
[SPEAKER_00]: anatomical differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In apes, the colon is greater than 50% of
the intestinal volume versus only 20% in
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clear that several bacterial lineages
have seemingly followed evolutionary-wise
[SPEAKER_00]: with hominids over the last 15 million
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, in industrial nations,
humans harbor the fewest genera of any
[SPEAKER_00]: primate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two bacteroid ACI lineages in
apes that have never been found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: American human subspecies, as I like to
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And severity of irritable bowel symptoms
is inversely related to the gut bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity, so this definitely has
importance to disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a person to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd suggest these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, probiotics that may be familiar to
some of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are oral supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are oral supplements of beneficial
gut bacteria that can be supplied as
[SPEAKER_00]: capsules or in fermented foods,
especially kefir, lacto-fermented
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, to replace the kind of thing
that is missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need something that those
bacteria like to eat, and those are
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are oral vegetative matter,
indigestible sugars and fiber,
[SPEAKER_00]: fructooligosaccharides, that serve as a
feedstock for the beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other studies looking at the
relationship between the microbiome and
[SPEAKER_00]: psychology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people ingest bifidobacterium and
lactobacillus probiotics, it reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: negative mood, a treatment for depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probiotics, these special bacteria,
in elderly patients improve detention and
[SPEAKER_00]: working memory as compared to placebo,
and that was statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some diseases, particularly
clostridial infections, that are treated
[SPEAKER_00]: with fecal transplantation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this was done in autistic children,
there were improvements in the behavioral
[SPEAKER_00]: and GI signs and symptoms over the course
of the ensuing eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Presumably, this was something that needed
to be repeated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the gut microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: These different bacteria affect
neuropsychiatric status in such conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: as autism, depression, stroke,
and schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mechanism of action seems to be
mediated through the autonomic nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: system, the enteric nervous system,
the immune system, and relates to
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to suggest now that there's
a role for the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we've seen marked changes in the
human diet as compared to past centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we've had skyrocketing
rates of chronic disease, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: obesity, inflammatory bowel diseases,
other autoimmune diseases, allergies,
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes, cancer, depression, and
neurodegenerative disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were not rare in past centuries,
merely because we're living longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's demonstrable that there are more of
these per the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, it's necessary to have
multiple probiotic species, not single
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, to protect against pathogenic
bacteria like clostridia and to gain these
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropsychiatric benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, probiotics may help control
PPAR gamma.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nuclear receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be hearing a lot more
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It regulates gene transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, it was shown that cannabidiol
and also THCA, tetrahydrocannabinolic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, are agonists of this receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been called the master regulator
of adipogenesis, the production of fat,
[SPEAKER_00]: also regulating tumor necrosis factor
alpha, which is important in autoimmune
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases and in inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prebiotics, so those vegetative matter
that the bacteria like, change the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiota to reduce fat production and
stabilize the gut so that it doesn't leak
[SPEAKER_00]: and allow toxic metabolites to enter the
bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that CB2, the
non-psychoactive cannabinoid receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, correlate to concentrations of
lactobacillus, what's in yogurt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and negatively, with clostridial species
that are often pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A study that directly relates to the
endocannabinoid system is this one from
[SPEAKER_00]: 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lactobacillus acidophilus, common
component of yogurt, a specific strain of
[SPEAKER_00]: that was administered and induced.
[SPEAKER_00]: CNR2, that's the gene that produces the
CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's RNA expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above that, in the human HT29 epithelial
cells, and that was statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they demonstrated that, as well as an
enhancement of morphine's painkilling
[SPEAKER_00]: effects in rats, highly statistically
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that reduction in pain was inhibited
when a CB2 antagonist was administered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that fits together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting study from 2011 looked at
obesity in cannabis users and non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: users.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they found was obesity rates were
only 14.3% and 17.2%, respectively,
[SPEAKER_00]: among participants using cannabis at least
three days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a one-third reduction over
non-users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, those who used cannabis had
significantly better body mass indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what yours is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another study directly relating
cannabinoids to this issue was done in
[SPEAKER_00]: Calgary, published in 2015 by Nina Clooney
and the group there.
[SPEAKER_00]: DIO mice have a genetic susceptibility to
obesity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gain weight on the same dietary
intake that doesn't affect others.
[SPEAKER_00]: When administered THC that altered their
microbiome balance, affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: firmicutes and bacteroidities ratio,
the THC essentially prevented the ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: increase or weight gain despite being on a
high-fat diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could help explain what we observe
in humans, as we'll see from these
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who use cannabis suffer from a
variety of stereotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common one is the cannabis user
as a lazy slacker stoner, as we see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: illustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another one is this, that of the
skinny hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that he's got a grocery bag
full of vegetables, hopefully the right
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth is that the skinny hippie is
the more accurate representation of what a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis user is likely to look like as
opposed to the slacker stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, how do we change the way things are
and this destiny that our diet has seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: to impose upon us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this prebiotic array you see some
vegetative matter that may be quite
[SPEAKER_00]: unfamiliar to you, starting with acacia
fiber in the upper left, chicory roots
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes used as a coffee substitute,
sun chokes otherwise known as Jerusalem
[SPEAKER_00]: artichokes, then dandelion greens,
burdock, and then the more familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: leaceae, your onions, leeks, and garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these feed the beneficial bacteria
in the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, another thing that's changed
about our diets is our vegetables have
[SPEAKER_00]: become tasteless.
[SPEAKER_00]: In ancient times, people ate what they
could get to gather, and it included a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of bitter herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these have largely fallen out of the
diet, particularly Americans like things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are sweet and not bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be supplemented with herbal
bitters, as demonstrated in the photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been shown that these are present
not only in the tongue, but throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: gut, and specifically in the brain,
where they do such things as reduce hunger
[SPEAKER_00]: drive, the drive towards sugars,
and also seem to correlate with reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: such disorders as diabetes and even acne
in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, can bitter herbs allay
hunger via the hypothalamic and ECS
[SPEAKER_00]: mediated mechanisms and lead to weight
loss and counteract the metabolic syndrome
[SPEAKER_00]: and type 2 diabetes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are a couple of books on how to eat,
Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: which first came out in the 90s,
but still presents a very relevant diet on
[SPEAKER_00]: the more recent bestseller by Perlmutter
called Brain Maker, correlating use of
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of diet with prebiotics and
probiotics to improvements in autism and a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of other neurologic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hypothesis would be that we're seeing
common mechanisms between the prebiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: and probiotic diet and what cannabis can
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has led to this diagram that was
published last week, what I like to call
[SPEAKER_00]: the gut or grand unified theory that
relates the microbiome to treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: various diseases, including especially
beta amyloid formation, neurofibrillary
[SPEAKER_00]: tangles that are associated with
Alzheimer's disease and a variety of other
[SPEAKER_00]: neurodegenerative conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you see from the diagram,
it's not only beneficial bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's abundant evidence presented in
the paper, but not here today,
[SPEAKER_00]: that supplemental THC, CBD, and even THCA
may do similar things in allaying these
[SPEAKER_00]: type of afflictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests a new approach to
neurological therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have always said throughout my career
that it needs to be a preventative and
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic specialty rather than just a
diagnostic one to provide better treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: for epilepsy, tumors, Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's, traumatic brain injury,
[SPEAKER_00]: and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this includes aerobic activity,
which is known to stimulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education throughout life seems to help
prevent dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And above all, an anti-inflammatory
prebiotic and probiotic diet that should
[SPEAKER_00]: emphasize saturated and monounsaturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's olive oil, as we heard previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also omega-3 essential fatty acids,
bioflavonoids from things like berries,
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented foods, protein, and minimizing
carbohydrates, which have only been used
[SPEAKER_00]: in abundance by humans for about 3,000
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, this can be supplemented
with cannabis extracts providing the THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, THCA, karyophylline, and other select
terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three minutes remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess people can come to the
microphones then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll attempt to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not plan that to come out within
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: The microphone's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just please talk closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you took my bacteria, my gut,
and I would imagine my formicutes and
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteroidities level is a good one in that
I would have lower bacteroidities and
[SPEAKER_01]: higher formiculities.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you took that and did a fecal
transplant into someone obese,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: They would expect an improvement in their
weight and intakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it might be a temporary
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it works the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a rodent model of Parkinson's
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take the fecal matter from
the affected mice and put it in those that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't affected, they become symptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is being used a lot now in
gastroenterology practices to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common situation is treating
clostridial infections that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: recalcitrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that is a function of
antibiotic use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would point out that part of the
reason we're having so much trouble with
[SPEAKER_00]: these autoimmune diseases is not just
changes in diets, but overuse of
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics that are suppressing normal,
desirable bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a follow-up question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised you didn't talk about
antibiotics more in this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we only had 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
