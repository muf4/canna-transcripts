[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head over to canmedevents.com now to learn
all about our CanMed 2022 event,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will take place May 3rd through 5th
at the Pasadena Convention Center in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pasadena, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This three-day event begins with a
full-day medical practicum led by Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnie Goldstein, the practicum's
originator, as well as Dr. Dustin Sulak,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Kevin Spellman, and Eloise Thiessen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of the presenters will share the
latest research as well as their clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and practice guidelines related
to cannabinoid therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new section of this eight-hour course is
dedicated to reviewing different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions, products, and optimal dosing
for cannabinoid therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we have two full days of
presentations and panel discussions
[SPEAKER_00]: covering the latest research in the
cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and safety testing taking place May 4th
and 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full schedule is up at canmedevents

[SPEAKER_00]: This episode's guest is Dr. David Jolie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the associate professor at the
University of Moncton, where his team
[SPEAKER_00]: investigates cannabis and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Jolie has a unique expertise in the
field of plant genomics and their
[SPEAKER_00]: associated microbes, and his work has been
cited more than 1,000 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier this year, Dr. Jolie published a
paper titled Genome-Wide Characterization
[SPEAKER_00]: of the MLO gene family in cannabis sativa
reveals two genes as strong candidates for
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an important paper when it comes to
breeding powdery mildew-resistant cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we discussed, PM is as common as it is
destructive, and it torments all types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growers, from the hobbyist home
grower to large-scale commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our conversation, we discuss how PM
infects cannabis plants and how
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions play a role,
the prevention and remediation options
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivators currently have,
the difference between PM resistance and
[SPEAKER_00]: PM susceptibility, and how both variations
can affect the severity of infection,
[SPEAKER_00]: how breeding out PM susceptibility genes
provides more robust protection than
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding in PM resistance genes,
what are MLO genes and how do they affect
[SPEAKER_00]: PM susceptibility, how MLO genes were used
to breed out PM susceptibility in other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, the importance of having a quality
reference genome to investigate genes of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest, and much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with Dr.
Jolie, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Cannopedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannopedia.net is the world's most
comprehensive cannabis genomic library,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a recent update has made it easier
than ever for customers and researchers to
[SPEAKER_00]: explore Cannopedia's database of more than
1,400 cannabis cultivars to make smart
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding decisions and demonstrate novel
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannopedia.net now has a number of new
features to help explore your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars' genomic data, improved search
and filtering, make it easy to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars of interest within the
Cannopedia database, new visualizations
[SPEAKER_00]: and variant tables highlight high-impact
variants in genes of interest,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the MLO genes cited in Dr.
Jolie's paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Responsive design means you can view your
reports on any screen, private reports
[SPEAKER_00]: allow you to keep sensitive data hidden,
and much more.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: David Jolie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you and your team recently
published a pretty important paper on
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew susceptibility,
which we are going to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I wanted to lay some
groundwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our audience here on the podcast includes
people from all facets of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, and not everyone's going to be
intimately familiar with PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by outlining the powdery
mildew problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering if you could explain
why is powdery mildew a threat to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, what is at stake here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, first of all, I would say that
powdery mildew is a threat because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very common, first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not something rare that people are
likely not to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it certainly will happen at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very common and it can spread very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when once a crop is infected,
so usually the recovery options are often
[SPEAKER_01]: limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want growers, of course,
to use those nasty fungicides that we see
[SPEAKER_01]: sometime on other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we still have access to a few
environmentally friendly options,
[SPEAKER_01]: but those are not always very efficient or
they are not easy to apply on larger
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now about its impact on the plant
itself, of course, it will really kill it
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's what we call an obligate
biotrope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it needs living tissues to propagate,
but it can severely reduce photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_01]: when it gets out of control, especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thus it will in the end affect yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something that no grower want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another impact I can think of is,
of course, it will affect the smell of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have a plant infected by
powdery mildew, people will notice it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: different smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know that consumers are more and
more interested in the flavors and the
[SPEAKER_01]: scent, the aromas of their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly it's a problem that people
will want to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's called powdery mildew because
it has sort of a powdery white look on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves when a plant is infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm familiar with the fact that it
will show up on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it also infect the flower itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it sort of affect the bud that
eventually would get to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, we often say that that powdery
mildew can affect all aerial parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, which will include stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they're non woody, it can
infect the leaves and it can infect some
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the of the flowers, not all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like when we refer to cannabis
flowers, of course, we have the bracts and
[SPEAKER_01]: those can be infected by powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to understand that powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will hear a lot of things about
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will say it's systemic and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can describe rapidly how powdery
mildew works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually like powdery mildew first,
it's a fungus, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will propagate mainly through its
asexual spores that we call canidia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those spores will land on a leaf and
then they will germinate and produce those
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of tiny projections into the cells
from the epidermis and only the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So powdery mildew will only affect one
layer of cells, which is the first layer
[SPEAKER_01]: of cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't get further down than that
compared with other fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is certainly not systemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very restricted to the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have epidermis on leaves,
but we also have epidermis on the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you can see powdery mildew
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those tiny projections I was I was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gets into the plant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are needed by the fungus to absorb
its nutrients from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it will also be a way for the fungus
to suppress the defense response from the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then why do people think it's
systemic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's many reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other plants that survive winter,
for example, so people talk it was
[SPEAKER_01]: systemic because very rapidly in the
spring you could see powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: appear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the reason for that is that it can
stay dormant within buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not talking about cannabis buds
here, but like any axillary bud that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can find on a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can also stay dormant on plant
debris.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mostly, I think the big reason is that
it can be present, but at a very low
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people will think that the plant is
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will then propagate it or share it
with friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then suddenly the conditions become
favorable and it will be a big boom for
[SPEAKER_01]: the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can stay dormant at very low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an important thing you mentioned there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So environmental conditions can sort of
bring on an infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, so that's why usually so,
you know, people will have their mother
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so their mother plants are in a
setting where usually the humidity is not
[SPEAKER_01]: as high as the cuttings will be once they
start propagating that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a plan that was maybe not in
the ideal conditions for the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't see it, but it's still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you do the cuttings,
you put them into higher humidity level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the fungus likes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will start to propagate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you get your plants outside
of the rooting period, it will add time to
[SPEAKER_01]: get established.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people will often also see it
getting more important during flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it because it had time to mature or
because the canopy is maybe more dense or
[SPEAKER_01]: also because I don't know if the light can
affect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure it has been studied,
but maybe like, because we changed the
[SPEAKER_01]: light regime during flowering,
maybe it also helps the poultry mildew to
[SPEAKER_01]: propagate easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: More easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I know you briefly touched on it,
but I mean, a lot of your paper is about
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to identify these genes that may be
responsible for susceptibility to powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also the opportunity of
finding powdery mildew resistant genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm sure we'll get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the absence of sort of breeding for
resistance, what steps do you cultivate or
[SPEAKER_00]: currently have to either prevent PM
infection or once it's happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of remediate it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I mean, right now, as I said at
the very beginning, so there are a few
[SPEAKER_01]: options that exist to kind of reduce the
incidence of the incidence of the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and about those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know there was there was a study
conducted by the group of the group of
[SPEAKER_01]: Zamir Punja at Simon Fraser University,
who you also add on your podcast a year
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they they tested a bunch of different
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some are based on the use of bacteria
that will attack the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can talk about the products like
Actinavate or Rhapsody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also look at products that are
based on plant extracts such as neem oil
[SPEAKER_01]: and also some other products that are well
known in the in the organic farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as potassium bicarbonate or that we
know as Milstop is the name of the product
[SPEAKER_01]: that we often see for cannabis use or
hydrogen peroxide also, which is another
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will talk also about silicon,
because in in other crops, it has been
[SPEAKER_01]: shown to be very useful to reduce powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: UBC lights that are getting also
popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are different methods that can be
used to reduce the incidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess before we have to use those
those products, I think the key is to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep your plants as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as you detect infection,
remove the infected plant parts,
[SPEAKER_01]: try to not have dense canopies,
as I said earlier, try to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity maybe a little lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it is a fungus that is
airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those spores are very easily
transported by by any air movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, outside, it's easy to
understand that I'm talking about wind,
[SPEAKER_01]: but inside, you know, just people move
moving around or so you can get spores on
[SPEAKER_01]: your on your clothes, and then you get
into another another room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those spores can infect the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, so trying to reduce so if you
have a room that is completely infected,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, don't go in that room before
going into your cleaner room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know, just simple steps like that,
trying to reduce the inoculum levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that breeze brings us to the
prospect of actually breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to powdery mildew, which is
what your paper is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, powdery mildew doesn't
just infect cannabis and affects a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: range of other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering if you could maybe
explain how breeders have successfully
[SPEAKER_00]: bred for resistance in other crops and how
we might use that information to to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve it in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you said, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So powdery mildew is a big family of
fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have different species, some will be
very host specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And others have a broader host range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is the case for the one we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before we talk about resistant,
this is something we can just talk for a
[SPEAKER_01]: few seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's a problem in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have something that's very
host specific, as long as you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: any of those plants nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you you're less likely to
get that disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you have a cannabis field,
but you know, there is no cannabis field
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: If if the fungus was specific to cannabis,
then it's less likely it will get into
[SPEAKER_01]: your field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is that the species we
have is not specific to only to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can also infect a lot of different
plants from the the aster family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of flowers, like when we
think about dahlias and sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can get infected by that same
species and also some weeds like ragweed
[SPEAKER_01]: can also be infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something also to consider when
we're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's get into the the resistance,
at least what we learned from other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think some of the the first things
that were discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was on barley more than 50 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they they they discovered some
accessions from Africa that were
[SPEAKER_01]: completely resistant to to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that was the first point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they started to investigate,
trying to understand what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and they realized at some point that
it is a form of resistance, but we prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: to call it like a loss of susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So resistance and susceptibility,
you know, we we kind of try.
[SPEAKER_01]: We often think that it is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one is, you know, the plant is either
resistant or susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you breed a resistant plant,
we can see it as we're bringing something
[SPEAKER_01]: new to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bring a new genes that will confer
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is another way to to achieve
resistance is to reduce susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you have maybe something in
the plant that confers susceptibility and
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to remove that from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, people will think,
well, susceptibility, if there was
[SPEAKER_01]: something in the plant that would cause
susceptibility, it would have been
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminated by years of natural selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is that maybe those genes
are very useful for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant cannot get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a caveat of having those
genes is that they, you know, they cause
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptibility to some to some fungal
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is exactly what some genes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are getting interested into
those genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But MLO is one of those examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a resistant gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to find cannabis strains that
have either an inactive version of that
[SPEAKER_01]: gene or a mutated version of that gene
that will make it more difficult to the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen to infect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one interesting thing also,
when we're talking about resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as you said, so I published a paper
recently about the MLO family,
[SPEAKER_01]: but almost at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another group that published a
paper about PM1, which is a resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can talk a little bit more about
those two side of the coin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So resistant gene, the way that I can
describe it from a genetic point of view
[SPEAKER_01]: is what we call a gene for gene
interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have one resistant gene in the
plant that is able to recognize one gene
[SPEAKER_01]: from the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit like, you know,
like our own immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not it's not working the same way,
but it's easier to understand if we
[SPEAKER_01]: compare it to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have something that is more of a
recognition system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gene can recognize the pathogen
and triggers defense responses that will
[SPEAKER_01]: kill the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with that types of resistance
is that it's usually isolate specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will recognize only a few isolate
or, you know, one population of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen, or it can for a while looks like
if it's recognized the whole the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after a while, the pathogen will
rapidly evolve to overcome that
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So leading us to what we call a
coevolutionary arms race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we constantly need to find new
genes of that kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So new resistant genes, and we can try to
breed a lot of them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would mean maybe it will be more
durable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually, if you have only one,
it will likely not be durable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now when we talk about susceptibility,
then it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So susceptibility is usually more durable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is that you're
removing something that the fungus needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to enter or to infect the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very difficult for the pathogen to
adapt to that kind of situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: something is missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it cannot, you know, just create it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of resistant resistance,
it's loss of system of susceptibility,
[SPEAKER_01]: less of susceptibility will become a form
of resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is in that case, way more durable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is, it's also more
difficult to breed, because it's a form of
[SPEAKER_01]: recessive resistance, a little bit like if
you have two people with brown eyes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's easy, it's easy to get a
child with brown eyes, but to get a child
[SPEAKER_01]: with blue eyes, then it depends off if
there are some blue genes hidden
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the same thing here, you need to
find to bring that level of having the two
[SPEAKER_01]: mutated copies or the two different genes
must be inactivated at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's a little bit harder to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I come back to that, to that
example of barley I was talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: so 15 years, 50 years later, so it's still
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see that still very durable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and that was something that I
needed to kind of wrap my head around when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading the paper was that you
actually want less MLO for to really kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of simplify things, you want less MLO to
have more resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the quotes that I pulled out
from the paper that really hammers this
[SPEAKER_00]: home is that you said, expression of MLO
is necessary for the successful invasion
[SPEAKER_00]: of PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, what you're trying to do is
eliminate that MLO so it can't
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully invade, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as I said, it's it's not that
easy, because if that gene is still there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's because it plays another role.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's usually what people are seeing
is that if you inactivate a susceptibility
[SPEAKER_01]: gene, you can have some pleiotropic
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the case of MLO, so it's very
variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some crops, where they did that,
so you have some, they will see that they
[SPEAKER_01]: have either an increased susceptibility
toward other diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more resistant to powdery mildew,
but it becomes more susceptible to other
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases, or you will have early leaves
and essence and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in other crops, there doesn't seem to
be any effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe under some conditions,
it will, it would cause something bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But under the conditions that we keep our
plants into, you know, we take care of our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, we fertilize them, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it will never show any bad
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know for cannabis,
it will, if it will show some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: pleiotropic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if not, then it would become something
very interesting to breed.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now do we understand what MLO does to
sort of help PM invade the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what the mechanism is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, even though people have been studying
it for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they consider MLO as a negative
regulator of plant immunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But apart from that, we have no clear idea
of what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other MLOs that are not involved
in powdery mildew susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know a little bit of the functions
that those genes are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But clearly, it is not an indication that
the one we're talking about here that
[SPEAKER_01]: dictates powdery mildew susceptibility
would have a similar function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are more than one MLO genes in
the plant, and not all of them are sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: implicated in this PM infection,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some plants, you can have,
I don't know, five, maybe six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, no, let's start wiring that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most plants will have, you know,
around 15 or more MLOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within those MLOs, you know,
you have different subfamilies,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only one that is involved in
powdery mildew susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other ones, they play other roles,
as I was explaining earlier on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even within that subfamily,
so then it depends between crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for some plants, if you have,
for example, three genes in that
[SPEAKER_01]: subfamily, maybe you will need to
inactivate all those three to get
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in other crops, there seems to be
maybe one that is the leader or more
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you inactivate that one,
it should be enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in cannabis, we found two genes in that
subfamily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know yet if both are required
for susceptibility or if maybe it's only
[SPEAKER_01]: one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, to your knowledge, are there PM
resistant strains of cannabis out there
[SPEAKER_00]: currently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they exist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistant strains, I would say yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistant strains that are resistant
because of MLO inactivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because as I said, so we have those
other examples, like the strains that have
[SPEAKER_01]: the PM1 gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm aware of other people that have
those plants that will stay completely
[SPEAKER_01]: clean of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though they are surrounded by
plants that are covered with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly, there are probably a lot of
those genes that are similar to PM1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a matter now of identifying a
lot of those genes and trying to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: them all together to have a very resistant
plant that will resist to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different powdery mildew populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: MLO, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem right now is that if we look
at what was done for barley, and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: the same for peas and for tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants, the accessions,
they found that add that MLO resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always in ancient land races and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that we haven't explored that
much for cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and even if we consider going back to
wild populations, then it will be a matter
[SPEAKER_01]: of trying to find those wild populations
because it's not clear if they still
[SPEAKER_01]: exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so going back to sort of that PM1 side
of the coin, as you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and if I'm correct, that group that
that published on the PM1 gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were looking at one snip to sort of
indicate whether or not a cultivar was
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Information to really make that call?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it would not be a first for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look into systems where a lot of
different genes like that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: identified and studied, so we can think
about wheat with regards to rust,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a big problem affecting wheat or
even potato in its relation with late
[SPEAKER_01]: blight, which is also another big,
big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in those two systems, there is a lot of
genes like that that have been identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that's the only thing that
will be different between a susceptible
[SPEAKER_01]: and a resistant plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have one snip in that resistant gene
that will cause an amino acid change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's enough to gain resistance or
lose it, depending on how you want to see
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the same is true on the pathogen
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gene that is recognized,
only one snip can make it not being
[SPEAKER_01]: recognized anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that arms race I was I was
referring to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always difficult to predict how
long it will be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess another point that you
had made is that there can be a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways to to skin the cat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a combination of different
proteins that are inferring the resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: or the lack of susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be that a snip that's
identified in a certain population might
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily apply to a wider a wider
population, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we don't know enough about about
those genes as of now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for now, I talked about susceptibility
and resistance, but within resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I was talking about mostly is what
we call qualitative resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's either your resistance or you're
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there is also what we call
quantitative resistance, which is a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: different, harder to breed as well,
because it's we don't know exactly how it
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of genes that are involved,
each one playing a minor role.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's together that they bring
resistance resistance to a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so trying to find an example for
cannabis would be maybe the genes that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been identified by the medicinal
genomics group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they identified chitinases and tomatins
that seem to correlate with the levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that case, I would tend to believe
that maybe they are involved in something
[SPEAKER_01]: more quantitative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are very interesting because
quantitative resistance, as I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: is harder to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as anything that is harder to breed,
it's also it also means that it's harder
[SPEAKER_01]: for the pathogen to defeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that I picked up in the
paper that sort of maybe talks to maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a quantitative type of lack of
susceptibility was that, if I understood
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, hemp actually has fewer MLO
genes, in which case it might be less
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I get that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it's I would say it's a high
hypothesis that we that we put forward,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, in our paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at five different genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those genomes are certainly not all
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was only one that was really
from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Phenola genome CBDRX is considered as
having some hemp ancestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two were the one that only had
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for one of the copies, the then for
one of the two genes, they only had one
[SPEAKER_01]: copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is is is this an indication that hemp
would be more resistant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also it's also hard to talk about
hemp, because what we call hemp in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: is sometimes different than hemp in the
US.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hemp in Canada, it's often what we call
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: While in the US, hemp is more like CBD
producing plants, but they often have the
[SPEAKER_01]: same ancestry as, you know, THG producing
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you touched on the fact that sort
of the process that you went through to
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate these genes is you used a
variety of different reference genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of how important is it to have a
really strong reference to do this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: work and sort of what was the variation in
quality that you encountered?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I mean, any people doing
research is always looking for one
[SPEAKER_01]: reference genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually that's what they have in other
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and when we started working,
we were looking for which one we could we
[SPEAKER_01]: should use as a reference, because it was
not clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, a lot of people were
considering purple Kush as the reference
[SPEAKER_01]: just because, you know, there was a first
draft of it in 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were aware that purple Kush was not
the best one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people were considering CBD RX as
the new reference genome because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it has a very high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to first decide on which one
we would call our reference genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to look at first Jamaican lion,
CBD RX and purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then only looking at those three,
it was not easy to decide which one was
[SPEAKER_01]: the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, each one has its benefits,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD RX was, you know, a very clean,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe too clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that maybe later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, very less repetitive
compared to the other genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had a chromosome level assembly,
which was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of, you know, we were
considering maybe that one is the best
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaican lion was also very good,
but it was maybe a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: repetitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also there was no chromosome level
assembly at least available to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Kush, well, it was the worst of the
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can skip this one for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so it was, you know, deciding between
Jamaican lion and CBD RX.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what I said, CBD RX, you know,
might have looked better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I said, it was maybe too clean
because when we started looking at our
[SPEAKER_01]: gene family, so we realized that one gene
that we found in the other genomes was
[SPEAKER_01]: absent from CBD RX.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it something real?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe CBD RX is missing that gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't looked into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or has it been, you know, clean a little
bit too much or they try to remove,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, repetitive elements from it and
by accident, they remove that gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of decided to move forward with
more than one genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we decided, okay, so we're just
gonna add the other two that were
[SPEAKER_01]: available at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Finola, which was also interesting
because it was hemp, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was maybe a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Jamaican lion, there was also a
male version.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to add that as well because
then we add Finola and Jamaican lion
[SPEAKER_01]: males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two males, three females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to see if there could be
differences as well, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Y chromosome and the X
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you find any difference there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there were some differences,
but, you know, at this stage, is it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, real biological differences or
are they difference that are caused by,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, technical aspect of,
you know, some genomes being better than
[SPEAKER_01]: others?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sure, I would say that purple Kush
Finola as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they were showing a lot of
errors in the sequences when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if we would try to transcribe those
genes, they would not transcribe well into
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins because they add, you know,
some extra letters or some missing
[SPEAKER_01]: letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we thought, well, maybe it's a
reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe those genes have been inactivated in
those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when we looked at other data from
the same plants, so we had to look at some
[SPEAKER_01]: transcriptomic data from those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that those differences were not
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly it was an error during the
assembly process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two had more problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say they were more fragmented as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, so for those two, it was easier
to say that we would prefer not to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with those two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they will get better at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're still trying to,
you know, to make them cleaner or to make
[SPEAKER_01]: them better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the other two, it's really the
difference that we talked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe CBDR is being too clean,
but Jamaican Lion, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe still too repetitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's hard to come with the
perfect genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how does the quality of reference
genome that we were working with in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis compare to some of these other
crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we still very far behind?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not that far behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think we're certainly getting
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of the community,
you know, deciding on which one is their
[SPEAKER_01]: reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we start building on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the problem we had is that,
you know, and it's not only for,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's the same for all crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say for all organisms,
you know, people, it's so easy right now
[SPEAKER_01]: to sequence things, to sequence complete
genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will sequence it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality is not good, but we're still
going to, you know, upload it onto NCBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you end up having access to a lot
of genomes, but the quality is not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you try to work with those,
then it's, you start with a big,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a big bias in your study because
you try to predict genes, but if the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome is not complete, then you will miss
some genes will lead you to erroneous
[SPEAKER_01]: conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to have a good reference
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we, I think we have,
we have maybe two right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we're, we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, it, we sort of need to
choose a gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone's working off the same
reference, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it leads us to, you know,
maybe the other problem that we have is
[SPEAKER_01]: that usually when you have a reference
genome for another crop, so that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, was used to create that
reference genome is also accessible to
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can share that plant or that
accession.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they will conduct studies on that
same plan from which the genome was
[SPEAKER_01]: obtained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, I mean, it's not a matter
that people don't want to share it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they cannot share the plan because
it's forbidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jamaican lion, I mean, I'm sure that
people would like to get their hands on
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but right now, especially between
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from Canada, we cannot import from the
U S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure you guys could export
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's very a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when even going further, so,
you know, most crops, they have those
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm repositories, you know,
that, that scientists have access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have all those different
accessions, land races, sometimes mutants,
[SPEAKER_01]: or sometimes mapping populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how, that's how the scientific
community will move forward more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't, we don't have that for
cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winding down here for the, for the
purposes of maybe breeding out some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these MLO genes that are causing
susceptibility, where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are sort of the next steps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what I just talked about,
so if we could have access to more plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, more, more, uh, you know,
a lot of, because right now we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: what's available in the commercial space
is still very limited from a genetic point
[SPEAKER_01]: of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that there are huge,
like, yeah, there is a lot more variation
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so we need to get our hands on that
and see if that MLO based resistance maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: already exists within, uh, that germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't exist, then maybe we need to
create it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have access now to some
biotechnological tools like CRISPR to do
[SPEAKER_01]: some genome editing, but those tools are
not working for cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know a lot of people are trying to
develop those tools, but once we get them,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be, and I'm not talking only about
MLO here, uh, but you know, for any trade
[SPEAKER_01]: that we will discover maybe, uh,
uh, you know, a link between a genotype
[SPEAKER_01]: and a phenotype, let's talk about,
you know, a trichome formation or
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering or, uh, other types of disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we, we see correlation
between the genomic data and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and what we observe of the plant,
but we need to confirm those by,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, inactivating genes or
overexpressing genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some functional studies, but right now
we don't have the tools to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we're, we're lagging or
where there is a bottleneck right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you worry about how the cannabis
community might accept CRISPR?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, you know, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where also we, that's why I
always like to, you know, have both words.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we develop the biotechnological tools,
but at the same time, we try to explore as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as possible, you know, the natural
variation that, that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if, if the community really
doesn't want to hear about CRISPR,
[SPEAKER_01]: then maybe we can find some alternative
that have been accepted by the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the organic farming world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about, uh, traditional
mutagenesis, so, you know, we have the
[SPEAKER_01]: pink ruby grapefruit, which was created
that way, but you can still grow it like
[SPEAKER_01]: organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, CRISPR is not different from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even better, but we'll go with what
people accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it seems like the regulations
though, are really an impediment to really
[SPEAKER_00]: making a dent in this and many other,
um, breeding breakthroughs that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: be making.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, at the same time,
you know, doing research on cannabis was
[SPEAKER_01]: not even possible 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things are moving fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe those, those, uh, impediments
will also fall in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, before I let you go, I wanted to
give you the opportunity to share with the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience, um, any additional resources you
think might be of interest or any website
[SPEAKER_00]: or social media to stay in contact with
you, uh, share away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, I mean, I'm on Twitter,
uh, I D J O L Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my username there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I, I don't tweet that often,
but, uh, you know, when I tweet,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's usually because we have a new paper
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good way to know, uh,
what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we published quite a few in,
in the last, uh, few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were also working on, you know,
um, looking at, uh, beneficial bacteria or
[SPEAKER_01]: they can promote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cannabis growth and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a, you know, it's not only
very, uh, hard to understand genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but we also do water type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and hopefully we'll continue to,
uh, to look at that in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and not only disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're interested in looking
into other traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so we'll see what the future brings.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be the topic for another podcast.
