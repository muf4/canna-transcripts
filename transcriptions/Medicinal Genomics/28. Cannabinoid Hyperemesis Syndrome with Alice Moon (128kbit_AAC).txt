[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, my guest this episode is Alice Moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alice is a PR and marketing professional
who has worked in the cannabis space since
[SPEAKER_01]: 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2018, Alice was diagnosed with
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and had
[SPEAKER_01]: to cease cannabis use completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since being diagnosed with CHS,
Alice has found herself being an advocate
[SPEAKER_01]: for safe and mindful cannabis consumption,
awareness, and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: At CanMed 2019, Alice participated on a
CSH panel, which is the first time I had
[SPEAKER_01]: heard about this condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, her passion for educating on
the subject has garnered the attention of
[SPEAKER_01]: RxLeaf, Leafly, Business Insider,
and Forbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In early 2020, Yahoo released a
documentary featuring Alice, which I will
[SPEAKER_01]: link to in the show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: During our conversation, we discussed
Alice's experience with CHS, what little
[SPEAKER_01]: we know about what causes CHS,
what treatments provide relief from CHS,
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies cannabis users can use to
reduce their risk of developing the
[SPEAKER_01]: syndrome, how awareness for CHS has grown
since Alice developed the condition,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether patients who recover from CHS can
go back to using cannabis, the three
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of CHS, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Alice, I would like to thank this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode's sponsor, the American Cannabis
Nurses Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: ACNA is a national nursing organization
whose mission is to advance excellence in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis nursing practice through
advocacy, collaboration, education,
[SPEAKER_01]: research, and policy development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Founded in 2010, ACNA is now in its 11th
year with almost 1,700 members in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: They continue to work on providing their
members with up-to-date cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: information and resources to care for
patients who use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join them today at www.cannabisnurses.org
and be part of the change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, our friends at the Hemp and

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Alice
[SPEAKER_01]: Moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Alice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very interested to talk with you today
about an issue that I imagine a lot of our
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners don't know too much about,
cannabis hyperemesis syndrome or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have dealt with this personally,
and I know you've told your story
[SPEAKER_01]: countless times, but I hope you wouldn't
mind sharing it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just tell us about your experience with
this syndrome, and then we can talk more
[SPEAKER_01]: about kind of everything that goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I joined the cannabis industry
back in 2011, and in 2015, I started
[SPEAKER_00]: writing edible reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was consuming a good amount of
edibles, about 10 to 15 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd smoke about half a joint in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't consider myself a heavy user by
any means, but I was definitely a user.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use cannabis for anxiety, depression,
and for sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was definitely a medicine for me,
while I also would use it recreationally
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it had a lot of benefits and purposes
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 2016, I started to throw up,
and I would just get really sick for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: hours at a time, then it would go away,
and it would happen about once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as time went on, it started
happening more and more like once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2018, I threw up for 14 days
straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was nonstop vomiting all day
every day, 14 days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sick for 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doctors couldn't figure out what was
wrong with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then eventually I saw a doctor who said,
you know, it's got to be the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a three-month cannabis break,
and then I reintroduced cannabis back into
[SPEAKER_00]: my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got sick again, this time only
lasting four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said, okay, maybe I can
introduce CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and when I reintroduced cannabis into
my life, that was pesticide-free cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made sure it was pesticide-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because a lot of people say that CHS is
caused by pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went pesticide-free, still got sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I introduced CBD into my life,
and I was able to use CBD for about three
[SPEAKER_00]: months until I had my worst episode yet,
where I threw up all day every day for 16
[SPEAKER_00]: days straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a really crazy journey with
CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being so sick for so many years,
not knowing what was going on with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: having my near-death experiences for all
my throwing up, and my 16-day episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an ulcer, a hernia, and a bacteria
infection in my gut from all the throwing
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's unbelievable, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe you had to go through
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when was it that you actually figured
out that this was CHS, or that it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that was causing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be very frank, I had never heard
of CHS until I heard your story at
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabid 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what resources were available to you at
the time when you were going through this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How well-known was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't very well-known at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was barely any resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only things I could find online when
searching were very fear-mongering
[SPEAKER_00]: articles that are like, cannabis is bad,
and people are getting really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really sick, and it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very fear-mongering and wasn't
informative at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Jeff Robber, Raber, I don't know
exactly how to pronounce his last name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's with a terpene company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually is the one who told me to put
capsaicin cream on my stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that did provide some relief when I
used capsaicin cream, but then my skin was
[SPEAKER_00]: on fire and was burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I used a wet rag to try to wipe the
capsaicin off, not knowing that water
[SPEAKER_00]: actually increases the effects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just made it even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was crying in tears because my
stomach was on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I couldn't use capsaicin again
after that because it was so traumatizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But capsaicin does help a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back to your question, there wasn't a
lot of information out there at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few Facebook groups that exist
that are great resources now, but I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have them at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't aware of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until I started publicly
speaking that people reached out to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: told me about the Facebook groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took me a few years to really find a
lot of resources on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when did I first truly believe that I
had it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, before my 14-day episode,
right before, I had seen a doctor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she had said it could probably be the
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so before my 14-day episode,
I said, OK, I'm going to go have one last
[SPEAKER_00]: hurrah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to an infused dinner in the
Malibu Hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't want to pass it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that last hurrah is what triggered my
14-day episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it became very apparent that it was
cannabis that was triggering my symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to imagine that that must have
been hard for you personally, too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you were in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a very vocal advocate for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to have this be something that's
causing you illness must have been a hard
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very hard thing to accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a very challenging thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still get upset about it from time to
time because not only is cannabis my
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, but cannabis is my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cannabis socialite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to events all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I review products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I educate people on safe consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live, eat, breathe, sleep cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my world completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely a hard pill to swallow on
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if you could speak to what
has sort of the response been from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community now that you've been
more vocal about this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can speak from not really
experience, but talking with other folks
[SPEAKER_01]: on the podcast who have maybe raised some
concerns about potentially negative
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of cannabis that they do receive
some backlash from people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering if you experienced that
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I have had some support from
people in the industry, I've also had an
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming amount of backlash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone said I deserve to be beaten up
because I was speaking out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've received targeted attacks so many
different times from people both within
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry and outside of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lost a lot of peers in the space,
people who I thought that were like
[SPEAKER_00]: friends because they were just so
frustrated that I was speaking out about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they think that it's a potential harm
to legalization, but I just think it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential negative that needs to be
discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by not discussing it, we're doing more
harm than good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all agree that cannabis has
amazing, therapeutic potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we believe that it can do all of
these great things, then we have to assume
[SPEAKER_01]: that it could do some negative things too
in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully it doesn't happen too
often, but we need to acknowledge that
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a risk out there in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more we understand it,
the better we can use the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want the cannabis community to
understand that and become more accepting
[SPEAKER_00]: and aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was sick for two years before I
knew what was wrong with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because there wasn't any
education and awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, that's two years of suffering that
I went through that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I had to cancel all the time,
flights that were missed, things that my
[SPEAKER_00]: life was disrupted because I was so sick
and I don't want anyone else to have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think awareness is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the topic of awareness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, as I was saying to you before we
started recording that back in 2019,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you were on the panel about this,
this issue at Camid 2019, I had never
[SPEAKER_01]: heard of CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but since then I have heard of it a
few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, most recently in a clubhouse room
discussing THC limits that are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: placed on edibles where someone mentioned
that, um, CHS, uh, is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, a lot of people on that call had,
had never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually, I actually, uh,
raised my hand and pointed people to the
[SPEAKER_01]: video of the panel that you were on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I hope people actually check that
out and I will definitely add a link.
[SPEAKER_01]: Link to that in the show notes for,
um, for this podcast as well, for anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: who hasn't seen it, but back to the
original question about awareness,
[SPEAKER_01]: that how has awareness grown, um,
since 2019?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, awareness is definitely growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was featured by Washington post
last summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a cover story in their health
section of the newspaper, um, about CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, business insider, Leafley high times,
they've all done pieces on it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you, um, TV station,
patients have also done pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think awareness is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I created an Instagram account and a
Twitter account that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I use CHS hashtags and I'm constantly,
I'm searching Twitter for people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can point them in the right
direction for resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think awareness is definitely
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more people are hearing about it,
but there's still a lot more people who
[SPEAKER_00]: need to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work is not over yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, during that panel in 2019,
you know, this whole condition was still
[SPEAKER_01]: very mysterious as to, you know,
what are the causes?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the treatments?
[SPEAKER_01]: There hadn't been enough research into
CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's changed on that front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have any more idea of sort of what's
triggering this condition or maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, at least some commonalities between
people who are experiencing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, at the CanMed panel, I had done a
survey of, I believe it was like 130 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, since then I've done a survey of 330
people and I asked more in depth
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the only commonality that we
all have is that we use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount that we use, the duration we
use, um, the type used, it all varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the age of people, the majority of
people were using for eight years or
[SPEAKER_00]: longer before developing symptoms,
but there were people who were using for
[SPEAKER_00]: less than a year that develop symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, there was one other point
with it that I just slipped my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, oh, um, there was a high
amount of people with anxiety and
[SPEAKER_00]: depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that, oh, if you have anxiety
and depression, you're going to get CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be those people are just using
cannabis to treat their anxiety and
[SPEAKER_00]: depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we have a high amount of
people that have it, but that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: preexisting condition that there was a
high amount of people having it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as treatment goes 90,
I think, believe like 97% of people use
[SPEAKER_00]: hot baths as successfully, um,
to treat their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Haldol is a medication that is
commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a small amount of people who
use Haldol and it did work for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it gave them such severe side effects
that they said they would have preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: the nausea and vomiting over the side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, Haldol is really a medication that
is being used more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the go-to now in emergency
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doctors are turning to that medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's an, uh, benzodiazepine and
anti-psychotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for people who don't have psychotic
issues, it can cause psychosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is, should be a last resort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capsaicin cream should be the go-to,
but a lot of doctors are using Haldol and
[SPEAKER_00]: a few other medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, University of Calgary in Canada is
currently doing a study to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial Haldol truly is as a medication
for treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see those results in a few
months, see what they come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they did a study already on Capsaicin
and so now they're working on Haldol to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how that works out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's encouraging that there are some,
some folks that are doing some research
[SPEAKER_01]: into treatments for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I wish that there was some research
going on into the cause behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be more beneficial if
we could figure out the root cause and a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to test for it to see why this is
occurring, um, who this is occurring in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way people, if there's like some
type of genetic predisposition,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could figure it out sooner before
people go through, you know, months to
[SPEAKER_00]: years of suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that really, um,
kind of stands out to me is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as you, as you mentioned in your
story is that you enjoyed cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: symptom-free for years, um, before
developing this condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, do we understand is there some
sort of, you know, mechanism that flips
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can no longer tolerate it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously I think, as you said,
we still don't know, but it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, it seems interesting and not something
I can really think of happening with any
[SPEAKER_01]: other allergy or, or condition or
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's just like a flip that
gets switched all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, your body just rejects it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one theory that too much cannabis
can turn off the TRIP1 receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the TRPV1 receptor, which is, um,
a receptor it's a capsaicin receptor that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually helps regulate digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's suggested that perhaps too much
cannabis can turn off that receptor in
[SPEAKER_00]: some people and the heat, hot baths and
capsaicin cream on the stomach turn that
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor back on because it's a capsaicin
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is that theory that, um,
potentially that receptor is what is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting shut down, but you know,
that is just a theory and we don't a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred percent know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is there any sort of general advice
that, that folks are giving to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sort of prevent that if it is
sort of like an overload of that system in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of, you know, whether it's taking
regular breaks from cannabis to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: reset the receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently did a podcast with Dr. Dustin
Sulak, who, who recommended that not in,
[SPEAKER_01]: not for CHS specifically, but just in
general to, you know, take a break every
[SPEAKER_01]: now and then, and that you can actually
see some regeneration of, um, CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors in just 48 hours of cessation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there, any thought to maybe that
being a potential way to prevent something
[SPEAKER_01]: like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone should take cannabis
breaks every now and then, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: just give your body a reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I think that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that I rarely did is
I didn't take breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was consuming quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I wish I would have taken more
breaks, um, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, there's three
phases to CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a prodromal phase, which is
nausea, um, and stomach aches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the hyperametic stage,
which is where the people are throwing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the recovery stage,
which is when you're getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people hit that prodromal stage,
the beginning stage of it, where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just feeling nauseous, that's definitely a
key sign that they should be taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully by taking a break,
they won't ever get to the hyperametic
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that something that, you know,
will start happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you'll feel nauseous with one session
and it sort of goes away, but you continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to use and it progresses, or does it all
kind of progress one after another?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of progresses generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and some people won't even experience
a prodromal phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't experience that phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went straight to the hyperametic phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hits everyone differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, like there isn't like a
real pattern with things that kind of is
[SPEAKER_00]: like all over the place with how it's
going to affect people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing is it's usually not
immediately after smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually about 24 hours after using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it can be hard to correlate
that it's cannabis because it's not always
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately after use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you get to the hyperametic
phase, um, and you're like, really bad
[SPEAKER_00]: off, it can happen immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right after you smoke, you're
immediately sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally for people, it's like 24
hours afterwards, which is really why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to correlate the fact that it is
cannabis making you sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the things that you had
mentioned on that panel is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is largely accepted or believed
to be kind of an anti-nausea, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if what you're saying is that after 24
hours of using cannabis, you could start
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling nauseous, it's not, um,
it could be a logical response to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'll have some cannabis to help
relieve my nausea, but that could be the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact opposite of what you should be
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do use cannabis to try to
treat their symptoms of CHS and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: only make themselves worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cause they don't know about CHS
and what's going on with their body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so I mean, we're talking about
raising awareness in, in users,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what about awareness amongst,
um, medical professionals and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ER physicians, for example, um,
you know, what sort of efforts are being
[SPEAKER_01]: done to kind of educate them on,
on this condition?
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year I worked with the Institute
for safe medicine practices in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we developed a brochure to give out
to, um, people in emergency rooms all
[SPEAKER_00]: across Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, now I have Canada down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's next to US try to work on
something similar, um, in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, I'm just one person here
and I don't get paid to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried my hardest to get things done,
but so we, at least educated, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, physicians and emergency room
doctors in Canada, but there isn't a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of efforts being made in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's two issues right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either doctors don't know about CHS or
doctors know about it and they're too
[SPEAKER_00]: quick to diagnose people with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of doctors can misdiagnose people
because they just ask the patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, are you using cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's making you sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that person could potentially have
other underlying conditions that the
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor doesn't want to test for because
they just want to put it straight to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of, um, makes people
disbelieve in CHS because then they end up
[SPEAKER_00]: finding out that there's something else
going on with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're saying, you know,
doctors are just too quick to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think that there's like two
issues at hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to educate doctors on it,
but we also need doctors to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're ruling out every other possibility
before saying it's CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, so I guess in that, in that vein,
are there some symptoms that are specific
[SPEAKER_01]: to CHS?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of a clear indicator that
that's what, that's what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding a relief from a hot bath is one of
the key indicators that doctors use for
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis, because there isn't anything
else that really provides this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about like, I was throwing up
excessively and I would get in the hot tub
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would stop completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within seconds of getting out of
the tub, I'd be throwing up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really that like, important and
just impactful, the hot bath, the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I was like living on my bathroom
floor, going between like throwing up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hot bath for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, that just leads to more
dehydration, which is not good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which, you know, there have been a few
deaths from CHS from dehydration and organ
[SPEAKER_00]: failure because people are throwing up so
excessively and they don't know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on with them and they aren't treated
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately, you know,
they have died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been five reported deaths total
on CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, and I think you kind of
touched on it before, but I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe we could talk about it again,
but I mean, what is it about the hot bath
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically that is providing the relief
if we even know, or if there's a theory
[SPEAKER_01]: behind that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a theory about TRPV1 receptor,
which I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also a theory about,
um, body temperature regulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, blood temperature regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not too, um, privy on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't really speak on it too much,
but there's just a few theories around
[SPEAKER_00]: going around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the TRPV1 and the TRP1
receptor one is the one that makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: most sense out of everything I've read
that the hot bath turns that receptor back
[SPEAKER_00]: on temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get out of the hot bath,
that receptor gets shut back off and your
[SPEAKER_00]: body goes haywire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of the other things that you
mentioned on the panel that some folks get
[SPEAKER_01]: some relief with is running, which,
um, the first thing, and the first thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that came to my mind when I heard that was
anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, could anandamide be playing a
role?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I think the doctor on the panel
mentioned more about the temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation aspect of that, but I'll let
you speak to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So running is something that has helped,
um, in a survey that I did, there was only
[SPEAKER_00]: a small amount of people who got relief
from running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, only I think like, I don't know,
like 10% of people found relief from
[SPEAKER_00]: running, but that still is a percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like 33 people who found relief
from running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there was one study, um,
documented case of someone getting grabbed
[SPEAKER_00]: a myelosis from running so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone ran for like 17 hours straight and
just, um, did his body dirty by just
[SPEAKER_00]: running so much and his body just,
you know, shut down on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he didn't die thankfully, but he got
grabbed a myelosis from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we don't really understand the
why behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with my second episode, I,
the one that lasted four days,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got up and went for like extensive walks
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that helped at all,
but I know that my episode only lasted
[SPEAKER_00]: four days that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of the 14 or 16 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could have had some type of
impact, the moving around, the changing of
[SPEAKER_00]: body temperature, um, that could have
helped with my, um, symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to ask you, um, so what is
your relationship with cannabis now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is it still that you cannot tolerate
any at all, or is there any, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: are there any cases of folks who have CHS
who are able to reintroduce cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: or is it just, you know, it's done?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, from what I've seen, people who
reintroduce cannabinoids, if they have
[SPEAKER_00]: CHS, they do end up getting sick again,
but it's a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always like immediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be after years or it could be
after weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it, the symptoms do come back,
but a lot of people don't want to give up
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as their medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they figure out ways to use it lightly,
whether that be just using like one hit a
[SPEAKER_00]: day, one talk a week or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a lot of people who still
consume and they just listen to their
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the nausea starts to creep up,
they take a cannabis break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, um, my endocannabinoid
system is so overdone that I can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: handle secondhand smoke now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friends can't even smoke around me,
um, or I will start to throw up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can't use cannabis at all,
but I still work in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still extremely passionate about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do PR and marketing and social media
and, um, I promote the plant and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: its benefits and I love it so much and I
want to cure so that way I can go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: using my medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and I think that's an important,
um, an important thing to bring up again,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, um, like you said, you
experienced some backlash talking out
[SPEAKER_01]: about against, excuse me, you experienced
some backlash speaking out, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: about this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes people, you know,
are very black and white when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either, it's either all good or it's
all bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you're a great example of,
you know, acknowledging the bad and the
[SPEAKER_01]: good and, you know, having a very,
um, level headed perspective on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think something else that we should
touch base on is what happens when
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody stops using cannabis,
because that's also not talked about at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you think you stop using cannabis and
then you're all better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, people can go through withdrawals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had extreme nightmares when I quit
using cannabis, my anxiety heightened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, that could be because I
had preexisting anxiety, um, but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to plenty of people who didn't have
preexisting anxiety and they quit using
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had anxiety afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had loss of appetite, sleep issues,
um, agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things that can go on
mentally and physically with the body when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're quit using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as cut and dry as,
oh, you have CHS just quit using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like somebody can go through a lot of
really gnarly withdrawals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the industry likes to say that
there isn't any withdrawals from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's simply not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body is going through some changes,
you know, your body can be so positively
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted by cannabis when you're using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you take it away, can't you
imagine that some things could be going on
[SPEAKER_00]: with your body then as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if everything we know about the
endocannabinoid system is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's, it's to promote
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're constantly supplementing with
cannabinoids, um, and then you take those
[SPEAKER_01]: away, then there's going to have to be
kind of a readjustment period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes all the sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there has been so many people who
go back to using cannabis because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to deal with the nightmares and
the anxiety and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then, you know, it's a never ending
cycle of like getting sick and having to
[SPEAKER_00]: quit, getting sick, having to quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just quite simply, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it is good to hear that,
you know, some people who experience this
[SPEAKER_01]: can still, um, can still use cannabis in
small doses or more manageable doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I've, I've spoken to,
to doctors here on the podcast who,
[SPEAKER_01]: who say that a lot of patients can get a
lot of benefits from, from low doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of cannabinoids still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so hopefully if, um, if folks who are
really using cannabis to treat a severe
[SPEAKER_01]: condition or, or it's the only thing that
works for them, there's still some hope
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can continue to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, anyone listening to
this who thinks they might have CHS,
[SPEAKER_00]: just listen to your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are throwing up all the time and
definitely cut cannabis out of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're only feeling some nausea and
you're able to take breaks and then
[SPEAKER_00]: reintroduce it, like just tread carefully
and be very careful with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because you don't want to go into a 14
day episode like I went into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we sort of talked about it when
we were, we were asking if there was any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of correlation between, um,
the experiences of people who have gone
[SPEAKER_01]: through this, but, um, I don't think we
talked specifically of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: are there certain formulations or certain
forms of cannabis that, that seemed to
[SPEAKER_01]: trigger this more than others?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you know, smoking versus
eating or, you know, high THC versus high
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, or is it sort of all across the
board?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with my survey, um, only three people
were edible users only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was surprising that only three
people were just using edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of people were using
cannabis, um, as the flower itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And majority were using it out of bongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there is, you know, some people who
are using dabs and bongs, um, some people
[SPEAKER_00]: using vapes as well, but majority of
people were smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as, if it was high THC,
low THC, I actually don't know the answer
[SPEAKER_00]: to that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but as far as if it was pesticide free
or not, there is about half of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: grew their own and it was pesticide free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, and they still develop CHS
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but half the people didn't know
what, if their flower was pesticide free
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, with legalization,
we'll see more people who are like having
[SPEAKER_00]: access to pesticide free flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it'll actually know what
they're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but for now, a lot of people don't
have safe access.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're getting whatever they're
getting, but I don't believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides are the issue here at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think if it was a pesticide problem,
we'd see this a lot more widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has occurred with people with
synthetic cannabinoid use at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shows that it's like something to
do with cannabinoids is the root cause of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so what's next for you in your,
um, in your goal to try to raise awareness
[SPEAKER_01]: here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to keep doing interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to spread the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my next goal is to be New York,
be in New York times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the ideal goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was speaking with them last year
before COVID hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when COVID became a thing that
like cut that story out of the picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that would be, um, my ultimate goal is
to get in New York times, because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: a story that, that would just reach a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to just keep reaching out to
people, talking to people, connecting and
[SPEAKER_00]: educating and letting people know that
they're not alone with this, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt extremely alone and it was very
isolating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want people to know that I'm a
support for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have CHS, if they have any
questions about it, they can come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I also built a website, uh,
www.cannabinoid-hyperemesis.com where
[SPEAKER_00]: people can read 20 plus research papers,
patient stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an FAQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then there's links to all the
articles, um, that I've been in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for anyone who wants to really deep
dive into CHS, the information is all
[SPEAKER_00]: readily available for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's a great segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in addition to that website,
are there any other resources that you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like to share with the audience,
um, that I can kind of put into the show
[SPEAKER_01]: description so they can learn more about
you or about CHS or anything that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you think would be helpful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my Instagram account is the Alice Moon,
T H E Alice Moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a CHS account is cannabinoid
.hyperemesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people can reach out to me on
either of those platforms, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: either of those, um, accounts,
or they can email me at alicemoon at
[SPEAKER_00]: alicemoon.la.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm more than happy to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to them about CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will definitely put those into the show
description.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Alice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, thanks so much again for joining us
today and sharing your story and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, helping us get the word out
about CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I hope to see a lot more research into
this condition and I hope to see some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that research presented at a future CanMed
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
