[SPEAKER_01]: On this episode, I got to speak with Dr.
Marion McNabb, who is the president of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Center of Excellence and CEO of
Cannabis Community Care and Research
[SPEAKER_01]: Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marion is a public health doctor by
training and has nearly 20 years of global
[SPEAKER_01]: and domestic public health experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her team recently completed a veterans
health and medical cannabis research study
[SPEAKER_01]: with the goal of gathering information
from U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: military veterans regarding their current
health conditions, conventional medical
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments, medical cannabis use,
and its effectiveness with self-reported
[SPEAKER_01]: health conditions and symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a lot about the veterans study
as well as other public health topics
[SPEAKER_01]: related to medical cannabis, including how
military veterans use cannabis to treat a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of conditions to reduce dependence
on other medications, what barriers
[SPEAKER_01]: veterans face when trying to access
medical cannabis, what programs have been
[SPEAKER_01]: established to assist veterans with the
cost of cannabis medicine, how does
[SPEAKER_01]: veterans use of medical cannabis compared
to the general population, how has the
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID-19 pandemic changed cannabis use in
terms of frequency, purchasing habits,
[SPEAKER_01]: and conditions, how implementing proper
testing led to the eventual lift of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vape ban in Massachusetts, and how the
vote to legalize adult use cannabis in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Jersey affects the issues of public
health, social justice, and advocacy in
[SPEAKER_01]: that state.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get to that conversation,
I do want to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Science and Technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Science and Technology is proud
to present a special supplement in free
[SPEAKER_01]: virtual Veterans Day e-Symposium focused
on medical cannabis treatment for veterans
[SPEAKER_01]: with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: The supplement and symposium will feature
Dr. Marion McNabb and the data she
[SPEAKER_01]: uncovered in her 2019 Veterans Health and
Medical Cannabis Study.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, the supplement will include
articles with Dr. Stacey Gruber,
[SPEAKER_01]: veteran patient Stephen Mandil,
a VA caregiver, a nurse, and medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis advocates all heavily involved
with this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The e-Symposium will also feature a
special panel discussion organized by
[SPEAKER_01]: Stephen Mandil with the group of veterans
from across the country.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, as promised, here is my conversation
with Dr. Marion McNabb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Marion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really interested to talk with you
today because many of our guests on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast we've had so far and really a lot
of the presenters that we have in Can Med
[SPEAKER_01]: and sort of the medical area really speak
from a clinician's perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sharing their experiences and
their successes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the work that you're planning to share
at Can Med is really more focused on the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient's perspective, which I'll admit,
unfortunately, isn't a perspective we hear
[SPEAKER_01]: nearly enough at Can Med.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I'm really interested to
talk with you about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess instead of me telling you what
you're presenting on, I want to give you
[SPEAKER_01]: the opportunity to kind of tell us and the
audience about the data you've collected
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you'll be sharing at Can Med.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited and honored to be
presenting next year at Can Med.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the work that we did last year,
I'm a public health doctor by training,
[SPEAKER_00]: so more of a population level researcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year, I partnered with Stephen
Mandela and Anne Brumm of Joint Venturing
[SPEAKER_00]: Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: to launch the 2019 Veterans Health and
Medical Cannabis Study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this study was designed to understand
from a veteran's perspective, using
[SPEAKER_00]: through an anonymous survey, how veterans,
what are the current health conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: that they face?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the current treatments that they
are using to address their health
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ask further about their medical
cannabis use and how their medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use has impacted their life from
a variety of perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we partnered also together with UMass
Dartmouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study was approved by their IRB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had about an eighth month data
collection period and captured data from
[SPEAKER_00]: 565 veterans nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But majority of the focus of our outreach
and work was in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around half of our sample size is from
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what data from this study survey
really stood out to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or perhaps what information is really sort
of the take home message that folks should
[SPEAKER_01]: know about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the most interesting things
was to learn what health conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans were using medical cannabis most
commonly for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those out of the reported sample,
38% of veterans report using medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to address chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: As their top health condition,
followed by 25% reporting medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is helpful for PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 9% reporting their top condition using
medical cannabis for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at chronic pain,
PTSD and anxiety as some of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, we do, and I will present at
CanMed some further data about each of
[SPEAKER_00]: those conditions and their medical
cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the most striking data points
that we found in this study is the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of veterans that are using medical
cannabis to reduce unwanted over the
[SPEAKER_00]: counter medications or prescription
medications related to their health
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, out of our entire sample of
565, 78% report using medical cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: actively reduce the use of over the
counter or prescription medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a public health perspective,
when you step back and look at this,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's never been a documented death or
lethal overdose with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there has been documented really
unwanted side effects and the possibility
[SPEAKER_00]: of overdose with a lot of the medications
that veterans are commonly prescribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think I recently read a study that
reviewed, I don't know, over 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans records and found that often
they're prescribed somewhere between 40
[SPEAKER_00]: and 50 medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the understanding the medical cannabis
is being reported by veterans as an
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative and actively trying to reduce
the use of unwanted medications is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: striking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, are there sort of barriers to
veterans getting access to this cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ask, what are some of the major
barriers for accessing and actually 51%
[SPEAKER_00]: report money to purchase products that
they want, 41% lack access to the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: right products for their conditions,
32% report they don't have the money
[SPEAKER_00]: required to get a medical card,
followed by stigma at 30%, owning a
[SPEAKER_00]: firearm at 29%, and then workplace testing
at 24%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also asked about how much money that
veterans are spending, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So of our top barriers are money to
purchase products, access to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: products, which is market related,
and then money to get a medical card.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we ask how much money are you
spending per month on your over the
[SPEAKER_00]: counter or prescription medications?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how much money are you spending
per month on medical cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And nationally, on average, veterans spend
$98 a month on out of pocket expenses for
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription and over the counter meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they spend $343 a month on medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without having understanding that it's
being used as an alternative, medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is not covered by insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, also the majority of our veterans in
our sample are getting their prescriptions
[SPEAKER_00]: mailed directly to them from the VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could just really tease out cost is
a major barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, so there's examples of,
I believe in Canada, they're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide free or low cost access to medical
cannabis for veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Massachusetts, Steven Mandela,
who I've worked with on the study and
[SPEAKER_00]: events last year, he partners with
dispensaries to share this information and
[SPEAKER_00]: to offer 40% off discount for 100%
disabled veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the use of this information,
I think, is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the areas of research that
I'm most engaged with is not only
[SPEAKER_00]: conducting studies and collecting data,
but then how do you actually use that data
[SPEAKER_00]: for policy change or to implement programs
or provide access?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, and I think the other barrier
that I think is quite interesting is the
[SPEAKER_00]: owning a firearm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because that's a part of federal
regulation, I think that's also something
[SPEAKER_00]: that is unique to this population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that one sort of jumped up to me as
well, because I mean, one would assume
[SPEAKER_01]: that veterans are probably more likely to
own a firearm than maybe your average
[SPEAKER_01]: citizen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so what is it about owning a firearm
that makes access to cannabis difficult?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Massachusetts, I am not entirely sure
about other states, but I'm not sure how
[SPEAKER_00]: enforced this is, but you cannot have a
firearm if you are trying to get a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the other really interesting
findings from the study was actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we now see that veterans are using
medical cannabis for a variety of health
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wanting to use it as an
alternative treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the challenges specifically for
veterans is that they can access private
[SPEAKER_00]: care, but they also access care through
the VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the VA is federally funded,
VA clinicians are restricted from either
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming recommenders of medical cannabis
and basically don't have access to a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of high quality education around where the
state of the science is for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I think this is really
important is because these veterans are
[SPEAKER_00]: working to get access to an alternative
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important for them to discuss
this with their health care providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now, policy at the VA is that
the clinicians and the veterans are
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to discuss about their medical
cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't lose benefits, and that will be
recorded in their medical record.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the clinician isn't allowed to advise
on types, dosages, and et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even really engage with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ask the veterans in our study,
is your VA doctor or clinical care
[SPEAKER_00]: provider aware about your medical cannabis
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And 60% said yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we ask, is your VA doctor or
health care provider supportive of your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And 59% said they don't know, indicating
it's not this clinical discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've maybe informed the doctor,
but they don't know if their clinician
[SPEAKER_00]: approves its use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I think, also another barrier
to really finding what the right dose,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the right products, dosages,
et cetera, for veterans for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, in my other
conversations with other health care
[SPEAKER_01]: providers, that's not an issue that's
really exclusive to veterans,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of citizens out there who
feel they could benefit from medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but there's just so few
clinicians who are well-educated and can
[SPEAKER_01]: really provide that guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is certainly a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was encouraging to hear you say
that in the absence of the VA giving
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits or giving access to medical
cannabis that some of the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: were stepping up and providing discounted
products to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really encouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder, and this is probably
something you've already looked into,
[SPEAKER_01]: but is there any chance that private
doctors or one or cannabis doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically would be willing to sort of
provide guidance to this population at a
[SPEAKER_01]: discounted rate or even perhaps for free?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some providers out there are
giving sometimes free discounts for
[SPEAKER_00]: special, but for a short period of time or
definitely discounted discounts for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually used this study under the
leadership of Steve last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used the data from the study to
advocate for a bill in the Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_00]: State House to mimic a program similar to
what's in Illinois where the veteran has
[SPEAKER_00]: already been diagnosed with conditions by
the VA and to have that paperwork used as
[SPEAKER_00]: an evidence that would be required to get
a medical card, so reducing the need to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did introduce that, used this data
to support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bill did not go through this year,
but changes will be made and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: try in the next session.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's a really important aspect
to have that medical cannabis specialist
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of guidance and help for veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody that is providing
absolutely free ongoing services,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that would be great if they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess another thing that sort of
stood out was you saying that so many of
[SPEAKER_01]: these veterans are trying to use cannabis
to sort of either replace or help reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of other medications that
they're using, but the cost is sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: barrier there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just seems so unfortunate that that
has to be the case because I think we all
[SPEAKER_01]: could agree that they would definitely
benefit from reducing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually I led another study prior to
this one in 2018 that looked at over 2000,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had over 2000 respondents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an open cannabis consumer and
patient study, so general population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found very similar findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 70% of people in that study of over
2000 sample were also using cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce prescription over-the-counter
medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is just an extremely
important public health reality that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a legal safe alternative
treatment that's available, I think it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: public health right to make sure that
that's accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other interesting parts in the
veteran study and in the consumer study
[SPEAKER_00]: that we ran is that they also report
reducing the use of alcohol and tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: much less now with the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about this, it's like
almost a harm reduction method for a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of substances that are more
lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only medications, it's
medications, tobacco, alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to both physical and
psychological relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad you brought up that survey
because I was looking at that data as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really one of the things that jumped
out to me, and it seemed to be almost the
[SPEAKER_01]: same percentage on the veteran study too,
was that 80% of the respondents said that
[SPEAKER_01]: using cannabis just generally helps their
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the top response for how
cannabis impacts their daily lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to ring true with what you
just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using cannabis and you're just
generally feeling better, that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably less likely to be resorting to
some of those destructive behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or finding it's a better alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wondered, were there any other
interesting correlations or maybe even
[SPEAKER_01]: some interesting differences comparing the
data from the veteran survey to the more
[SPEAKER_01]: open study?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the consumer and patient study and the
veteran study, I think one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences is in the top conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the veteran study, more veterans
express report having PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's one major
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see similarities like we just talked
about in the medication reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think differences a little bit in
smoke and in preferred methods and
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred time of day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, I think these populations
also in the veteran study, we had about
[SPEAKER_00]: half or over half of the respondents were
over the age of 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got that right, let me just check
on myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty substantially older
population versus what we had in our other
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but you gave me the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to dig in further and really try
and tease out those differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll write a blog and I'll make sure
to send it to everybody who's listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'd be great and be happy to
share it with the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do publish it before this
episode goes live, I'd be happy to put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in the show notes so people have a quick
way to get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that stood out to me and
you sort of touched on it there,
[SPEAKER_01]: was that I think this was at least in the
more open study that 54% of respondents
[SPEAKER_01]: said that smoking flour was their primary
method of consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was another question that
sort of asked for their preferred method
[SPEAKER_01]: where they could select multiple different
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still smoking flour was the top choice
at 79%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's just because I'm more in
the industry and aware of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of cannabis products that
are out there, whether it be vapes or
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles or tinctures or patches,
that it's interesting to see that smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: flour is still such a dominant preferred
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was wondering if you had any
thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that sort of just because it's sort of
the easiest one to access or the most
[SPEAKER_01]: widely known one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know if you had any thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in both of these studies, we focused
heavily on the Massachusetts market,
[SPEAKER_00]: although it was a convenient sampling
approach and anybody nationally could take
[SPEAKER_00]: the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we targeted outreach in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it might be because of the
nature of the industry at that time and
[SPEAKER_00]: the availability of products and not
having as many now that we do have now or
[SPEAKER_00]: could have in the future or even the
diversity of products in other markets
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's much greater than what's
available here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it's a factor of that product
availability because we see that access to
[SPEAKER_00]: the right products was one of the barriers
for the veterans study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe they want vapes and edibles and
it's too far away or only one dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: offers it or that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think it's probably also,
it's just a very common, people are
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally very used to smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people are new into cannabis now,
I think it can be intimidating to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other methods of administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're unfamiliar, maybe it needs
to be more patient education around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people gravitate towards simple flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that when I walked into the
dispensary the first time, I'm a consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a patient, but I was intimidated to
ask questions and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's probably availability in
the market, awareness about how to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: those other methods, comfortability in
consuming those other types, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and maybe one thing that sort of
struck me as you were answering there is
[SPEAKER_01]: could there perhaps be a correlation
between the method of administration and
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of the symptoms that they're looking
to alleviate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, I think that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not you're using a tincture or
an RSO or a flour, all of those by
[SPEAKER_00]: condition, I think people definitely
probably, if they're very committed to
[SPEAKER_00]: learning how to dial in their dosage and
everything that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting too is so we've run
these two studies, the open consumer and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the veterans health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And earlier this year, together with UMass
Dartmouth launched the COVID 19 medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and consumer study that I'm
running right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we launched that study and we have
several partners in Massachusetts and
[SPEAKER_00]: really looking at the impact of COVID 19
on patients and consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what are they consuming for what
health condition or symptom?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much and how has this changed during
COVID?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just trying to pull up the data
now, but speaking of cannabis consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: methods, let's see, let me find it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did ask, because of COVID, have you
switched?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has your cannabis use changed,
basically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, that 14% said that they
switched their preferred method for
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming cannabis, which I think is
really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 47% stated that they consume cannabis
more now since COVID 19 started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only 11% say they consume cannabis
less now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, people are consuming more
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also reporting using cannabis for
top health conditions differently than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now we're living in an environment
of COVID, which is heightened anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: also just heightened risk for people who
have underlying health conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: like medical cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think medical cannabis patients are,
I think should be considered a vulnerable
[SPEAKER_00]: population right now within the epidemic
or the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and they're also still reporting
in our COVID 19 study, replacing the use
[SPEAKER_00]: of alcohol or prescription medications
with the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other questions are you asking as
part of this survey?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we asked, how has COVID 19 impacted
your purchasing habits?
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 40% report that it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: One couldn't access legal recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now 14% reported now since COVID,
they purchase cannabis in the illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or unregulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12% now only order for a curbside pickup.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% reported they got a, they registered
to get a medical cannabis card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other questions that we ask are the
top health conditions, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what are the barriers again,
to purchasing, to accessing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: both pre and post COVID and access to the
right products is the top barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's increased since COVID started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then money to obtain cannabis products
has also increased since COVID started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stigma has decreased as a barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Place to consume cannabis has decreased as
a barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money required to get a medical card
decreased as a barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so did lack of healthcare provider
involvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what does that compare to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that compared to the study that you did
in 2018 or?
[SPEAKER_00]: We asked in the survey pre COVID,
what were your barriers and post COVID,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are your barriers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to rate their top barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also ask about COVID infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8% of the respondents reported they were
infected with COVID and received the
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11% respondents, I think they have COVID,
but they can't access a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 13% report they have current symptoms
of COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is very interesting because
of the emerging evidence around cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, terpenes, cannabinoid profiles that
are coming out right now from a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: research institutions related to the
impact of cannabis on COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: By interrupting the cytokine storm at the
end stage or different researchers are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at either THC or CBD or a
combination of different, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes and how they may
actually be a possible prevention measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite interesting data that's
coming out of Israel and Canada and South
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina and Georgia and other
universities, University of Miami.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as part of this study, we've actually,
I'm organizing an event to be held in
[SPEAKER_00]: December around COVID and cannabis and
where's the research and standing at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also from a clinical perspective
to really lead an engaging virtual event
[SPEAKER_00]: that will, I've invited several of these
researchers to present some of their
[SPEAKER_00]: preliminary findings to some clinicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll have a nice discussion at
the end about the state of the evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: around this and kind of what's the latest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to invite ourselves,
but I know that some of the folks on our
[SPEAKER_01]: team here have been looking into COVID and
cannabis more on the testing side to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that we have sort of a testing assay
to measure if there's any COVID on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products to sort of protect
consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say we've seen no evidence of that
in the marketplace, that that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main reason that our CSO,
Kevin McKernan felt it important to create
[SPEAKER_01]: this test was more so because one of the
encouraging signs of the pandemic was that
[SPEAKER_01]: in many states, they deemed cannabis to be
essential, which I think we can all agree
[SPEAKER_01]: was the right move to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the concerns that we had here
was that if for whatever reason there ever
[SPEAKER_01]: was COVID found on cannabis, that that
would completely shut down the supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of these patients wouldn't
have access to their medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to prevent that, we wanted to
make sure that there was a test available
[SPEAKER_01]: that should that become an issue that the
testing labs could run to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis is still functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thankfully, there really hasn't been a
need for that, but it's something that we
[SPEAKER_01]: felt very strongly about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I know that if you gave
them the chance that Kevin would be more
[SPEAKER_01]: than happy to take part in your event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you all for that because that
would have been a disaster to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have really shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and put patients at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for leading that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely, I would love Kevin to be
part of this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking of sort of maybe there being
a ban that took medicine away from
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, I know that when I was doing my
research on the many things that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in, that you were involved in
sort of advocating here in Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_01]: to lift the vape ban that had been
implemented after there was the vape scare
[SPEAKER_01]: where a lot of people were getting sick
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering if you'd like to speak
a bit about that since it seems like a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year, there was sweeping cases of
a valley going across the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sort of issues around potentially
contaminated products are really just a
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of understanding about what was
causing the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Governor Baker took very swift action
to ban vapes in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had looked at this issue in terms of I
just scientifically started to look from
[SPEAKER_00]: an epidemiological perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were the cases?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they be reporting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this coming from tobacco vapes or is
this coming from THC vapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just try to start to dig into whatever
I could find online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, at that time, also very
quickly, MCR Labs put together the vitamin
[SPEAKER_00]: E acetate test to start testing products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually worked together on trying
to figure out the science of this from the
[SPEAKER_00]: different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they put together that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to look into, like I said,
what be my potential causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually reached out to my father as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an international infectious disease
epidemiologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I thought it was a little
premature for to have such swift action
[SPEAKER_00]: without a little bit more further testing,
which only took a little bit of time to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really hurt the industry and really
hurt medical patients that rely on vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we put together a press
conference around this, invited Dr. Peter
[SPEAKER_00]: Grinspoon, Commissioner Shumlin-Title,
different experts, I give their opinions
[SPEAKER_00]: on the vape ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that we've got that recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, did advocacy around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eventually lifted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, now, since we
understand that Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think it was a premature
intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some studies that have come out later have
documented that it had really no impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: the valley cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I was, yeah, that was an
interesting time and an interesting time
[SPEAKER_00]: for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it took a really big hit for
patient access and just for the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: at large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, just another example of how
sort of the knee jerk reaction can be just
[SPEAKER_01]: to ban and how, you know, that
unfortunately is sort of a blunt
[SPEAKER_01]: instrument that's not always the best one
to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you demonstrated, having good
testing techniques to ensure patient
[SPEAKER_01]: safety is really the way to go rather than
just kind of do a wholesale ban.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for your work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran a quick survey of that as well,
because, you know, me and studies and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we did find that, I mean,
people when they're when they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to things, you know, they're and
you can't just cut them off with a ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So people did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Products on the unregulated market that
are not tested and that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily fully safe, driving across
borders to get things, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: saw that also probably when when adult use
was deemed non-essential in Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_00]: with Covid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I mean, in our study,
young people, like we said, I said that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some people now since Covid had
to seek their products on the unregulated
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look at that over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm going to look at the timestamp
of when adult use was banned in
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts and that data versus now
when it's back open and see if those
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'll be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know we're getting towards the end
here, and I did want to give you an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity that I know, in addition to
the work that you're doing in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: doing surveys and sort of larger scale
studies, that you also do a lot of work in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of advocacy and social justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to kind of get an update and
see if there's any any new things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're working on that you like to share
with the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long running advocate for social justice
and and addressing the failed drug war
[SPEAKER_00]: through effective programming,
education, access, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, we were a state approved social
equity training vendor for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So top nine courses in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, quite excited to partner
with Rider University and my colleague,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sarah Trocchio, who's a professor in
criminal justice at Rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's leading a course, and I'm one of
three mentors in the course that's focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on New Jersey and focused on New Jersey
legalization and the vote that's coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: and social equity in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are the student students are grouped
into three consulting groups, one focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on public health, one focused on social
justice and one focused on advocacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the students are actually running
their own research study that's approved
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Rider IRB as part of their
learning methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's open right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know anybody in New Jersey,
please take the survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help the students basically asking
opinions about legalization and social
[SPEAKER_00]: justice in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the students will be analyzing this
data and producing a report that would
[SPEAKER_00]: provide recommendations for future
commissions or advocates or others in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state around those topics of legalization
and social justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are trying to make this a very
actionable study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very quick data collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before November 3rd, if anybody is a
New Jersey resident, we encourage you to
[SPEAKER_00]: take take the survey and we'll be having a
virtual event on December 2 at 3 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: where the students will present the
findings and we'll have various advocates
[SPEAKER_00]: and experts from New Jersey also
participating in the virtual event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you send over the links,
I'd be happy to put that in the show notes
[SPEAKER_01]: so people can quickly get to that if
they're able to take the survey or
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely sign up for that event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's very appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You looking into New Jersey, because I
know that a lot of folks in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: here, especially us on the East Coast,
are very interested to see what happens in
[SPEAKER_01]: New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be only the second state in the
Northeast to really go full adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the general consensus is if
New Jersey goes legal, pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone else is going to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is definitely going to be a big
vote that we're all paying attention to in
[SPEAKER_01]: November.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to another pretty big one
that's going to be happening in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess just finishing up here,
I did want to give you a chance to let
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone know about the different
organizations that you're involved in and
[SPEAKER_01]: plug those websites, social media,
anything like that.
