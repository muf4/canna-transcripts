[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everybody, my name's TJ Martin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm the VP of Research and Development
with a company called Abstracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm here to talk to you today about a
new class of compounds called Canisulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds we've identified in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before hopping into that, I'm gonna give a
brief background as to who is Abstracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Abstracts is broken up into two companies,
Abstracts Tech and Abstracts Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Abstracts Tech is our terpene flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Abstracts Labs is a California
licensed hydrocarbon extraction facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason it's important we have both
these facilities is because with our
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed facility, we're able to not only
research cannabis in a legal manner,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also with our flavor house,
we have the flavor expertise to recreate
[SPEAKER_01]: and validate some of these analytics we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we wanted to know is,
what are the chemical origins of the
[SPEAKER_01]: gassy, skunky aroma in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are the potential impacts that
may have on the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: So why do we care about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers, this is a potentially desirable
aroma in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be perceived as a potential quality
metric in specific products, as well as it
[SPEAKER_01]: may influence purchasing decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a producer, this is important
to you because you're looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially increase that aroma potency in
your flower or even extract products,
[SPEAKER_01]: which then leads to making decisions of
optimizing your extract products and your
[SPEAKER_01]: extract processes, but also drives those
packaging decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending how you package your product may
influence the retention or loss thereof of
[SPEAKER_01]: these volatile sulfur compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: For non-consumers, this could be very
undesirable aroma and even considered a
[SPEAKER_01]: potential nuisance odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as for policymakers, they would
have tasked with trying to have odor
[SPEAKER_01]: control and reduction strategies,
potential health implications,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether positive or negative, and other
zoning implications.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to start answering these
questions and tackling these problems if
[SPEAKER_01]: we understand the chemical origins of this
aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis, as we all know, has a ton of
different flavors and aromas to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything from gassy, floral,
spicy, herbal, skunky, even some more
[SPEAKER_01]: exotic, new cultivars that have more
papaya, tropical, berry, citrus aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look into how the weight
distribution of secondary metabolites of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, how it evolves, we have,
you see cannabinoids by far the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: weight percentage, and it's currently
mostly THCA as far as cannabis goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to breeding practices, that's why it's
so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have other compounds such as
flavonoids, fats and waxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, we were interested in
this, which is the aromatic compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It breaks into terpenes and then
flavorants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I wanted to show this
figure is not only to show the wide
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity of secondary metabolites in
cannabis, but also the fact that,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you can see with these flavorants,
such as the can of sulfur compounds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom, it's a very low weight percentage
compounds, which does present potential
[SPEAKER_01]: issues with detection limits in gas
chromatography and other analytical
[SPEAKER_01]: instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So traditionally, the scent of cannabis is
always been prescribed to things like
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look at things like betamircine,
it's very fuely, like a chemical fuel,
[SPEAKER_01]: spicy, woody, limonene is very citrusy,
lemon, limey, linalool is very floral and
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But none of these have the sensory
descriptors of skunk or gassy that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for and interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we wanted to look towards nature
for inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since terpenes really don't give that
specific scent, it has to be something
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we look at other botanicals like
garlic, durian fruit, onions, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: animal species such as skunks,
and their pungent aromas are coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: other volatile sulfur compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us to believe in cannabis,
it's possible that its pungent,
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky gassy aromas are also coming from
sulfuric compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to develop a, and use a
special technique of type of gas
[SPEAKER_01]: chromatography equipment called two
dimensional gas chromatography or 2D GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Benefit of this over traditional GC that
you would see in the lab, a traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis testing lab or a lot of other
testing labs is it has an increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: separatory power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see more compounds as I'll go
over in the next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also equipped with three detectors
that are analyzing simultaneously as
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds are being eluded from the GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a mass spectrometer for identifying
the structure of the compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: a flame ionization detector for
quantifying, and a sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: chemiluminescence detector for quantifying
specifically just the sulfur bearing
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can start looking for those needles
in that haystack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to kind of give you an idea of the
benefit of why we went with 2D GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here on the left we have what a
traditional one dimensional chromatogram
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like has very well defined peaks,
but you only have maybe 20, 30 compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: in that specific chromatogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you could develop this method out
further and can get better separation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're still going to have to deal
with coalition from similar size
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when we go into the two
dimensional space, we're able to separate
[SPEAKER_01]: not only by molecular size, but also
polarity by having that second dimension
[SPEAKER_01]: column, which allows us to see now two,
three, 400 different compounds in a single
[SPEAKER_01]: run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see going from a one
dimensional system, two dimensional
[SPEAKER_01]: system, we're able to identify vastly more
compounds and start looking for what are
[SPEAKER_01]: these specific flavorants causing that
skunky gassy aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now just to demonstrate why using a
sulfur chemiluminescence detector was so
[SPEAKER_01]: important to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at the top plot, that's what an
SED looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only see the sulfur bearing compounds,
which has in that specific plot about 10
[SPEAKER_01]: different compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when you look at the bottom,
we have hundreds now since they're eluding
[SPEAKER_01]: at the exact same time on our system,
we're able to overlay these plots and
[SPEAKER_01]: start pulling out the exact volatile
sulfur compounds, solve those structures
[SPEAKER_01]: and determine what makes these specific
strains smell the way they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we decided to do is we
procured 13 different samples from the
[SPEAKER_01]: California marketplace of varying
different ages and different aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also procured two specifically that had
zero skunky gassy aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Gutaberry and Blackjack for our
controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bachio Gelato as well as other varying
OG and exotics to give it that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that had that skunky gassy aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put this through our internal
sensory panel and had everybody rank this
[SPEAKER_01]: from how pungent and how gassy and skunky
this was perceived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can start correlating this and
looking for trends in our data to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: if there are any particular compounds of
importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we saw was we, on top there we
have Bachio Gelato, our most skunky and
[SPEAKER_01]: gassy as well as Blackjack on the bottom
which is the absence of a skunky gassy
[SPEAKER_01]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found was there was a trend in
volatile sulfur compounds three and five
[SPEAKER_01]: in particular, but also there was a
complete absence in almost all the
[SPEAKER_01]: volatile sulfur compounds except for VSC1
which is dimethyl sulfide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dimethyl sulfide is common in a majority
of plant species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to give us, we then identified
the structures of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important were
3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol and
[SPEAKER_01]: 3-methyl-2-butenyl-acetyl-thiolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the ones we saw the greatest
trends with in the data in the most
[SPEAKER_01]: closely relating to the aromatic score
that everybody was giving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something important to notice is when we
were looking for direct trends in how
[SPEAKER_01]: things were changing, we saw that Prentol
thiol or Prentol mercaptan changed the
[SPEAKER_01]: most with the organoleptic scores.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a much more linear trend of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prentol thiol acetate was more so present
when a sample is perceived as gassy and
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky, but when it had a no gas and no
skunky scent to it, it was completely
[SPEAKER_01]: absent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we looked at terpenes as well to see
if there's any particular trends of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and there really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just kind of all over the board
which is what we were expecting going into
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something interesting we've been
looking into, Nick Jicombe's group has
[SPEAKER_01]: been looking into different cultivars of
cannabis to relate different major
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and what their potential
classifications could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started looking into that paper as
well and seeing if there's any
[SPEAKER_01]: correlations with ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something we noticed is that the
terpenoline, myrcine-rich cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've really never seen any of these can
of sulfur compounds present.
[SPEAKER_01]: These include things like jacquer,
different haze types that really just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have a skunky gassy aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really don't understand or know
why.
[SPEAKER_01]: These terpenoline-rich strains lack can of
sulfur compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just know that they do lack it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas carolfin limonene and
myrcine-pining-rich cultivars like your
[SPEAKER_01]: more modern exotics as well as your
traditional OGs do have a lot of can of
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur compounds in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we understand that Prentol thiol
acetates that are bottle sulfur compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: are what are the result in this skunky
gassy aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we know this, what can we utilize
this for other meaning in the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so something we noticed, because we
use garlic as that initial inspiration,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottle sulfur compounds identified in
garlic, that same structural family,
[SPEAKER_01]: we saw something very similar in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In garlic, we have allele thiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have Prentol thiol in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you have allele methyl sulfide,
you have Prentol methyl sulfide in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where there's di allele sulfide and di
allele disulfide in garlic, you have
[SPEAKER_01]: diprenol sulfide and diprenol disulfide in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's important is these garlic
bottle sulfur compounds, that's what gives
[SPEAKER_01]: garlic not only its flavor and aroma,
but also a lot of its potential medical
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it begs the question, do these bottle
sulfur compounds you've identified in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis have some other potential medical
benefits in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Second one to see, how do these compounds
change as a function of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do these compounds change as a
function of plant growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these there throughout?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this have an increase during
different stages?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how could they potentially change
during curing and storage?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did an in-house grow trial using
Gelato with our cultivation manager,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan, to see and capture this data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we saw is all the bottle sulfur
compounds weren't really detectable until
[SPEAKER_01]: about week seven of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important to note, we only
monitor during flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it really didn't start getting a
large concentration, noticeable amount
[SPEAKER_01]: until about weeks 10 and 11, which is when
we started the drying process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after from weeks 11 to 12,
which is one week after storage in a
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional mason jar container,
we saw huge decreases in the majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: these volatile sulfur compounds,
including Prentol mercaptan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next we want to know, do you detect these
in cannabis extracts?
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis extracts tend to have,
are done using butane hydrocarbons that we
[SPEAKER_01]: used here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One to see is, do these make it through?
[SPEAKER_01]: What we noticed is that all the volatile
sulfur compounds we were looking for in
[SPEAKER_01]: Gelato do make it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with Mario Guzman, also has Mr.
Scherbinski on this, to see that all of
[SPEAKER_01]: them did make it through in Baccio,
Gelato, and Aussie buried Gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically Prentol thioacetate was
in the highest concentration of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: volatile sulfur compounds, specifically in
the extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, we wanted to take this and find a
way to relate this to a consumer that
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't in a scary nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cognizant that chemical compounds to
traditional consumers may sound scary,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Prentol mercaptan, Prentol thioacetate,
diprentol sulfide, these aren't very,
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer friendly terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna relate something that means
something to a consumer because they are
[SPEAKER_01]: making purchasing decisions where they
know those are not at the dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we took our data from our same
sensory panel, we started looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical concentrations of these compounds
we're identifying to see if there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: linear trend or any type of consumer trend
we can pull out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we noticed is that right around 50
nanograms of these volatile sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds we started having, and basically
when it starts becoming like a turn on
[SPEAKER_01]: effect where it was that skunky gassy
aroma, and it really started peaking
[SPEAKER_01]: around 200 nanograms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's really important is that even
though the perception of that skunky aroma
[SPEAKER_01]: may not get a higher perception at higher
numbers, maybe slightly, that does then
[SPEAKER_01]: give you potentially longer shelf life
because you now have more volatile sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as it's off gas and you start losing
those compounds, due to transportation,
[SPEAKER_01]: storage, even how long it takes to sell
through at the dispensary level,
[SPEAKER_01]: the product going to that final end
consumer is still gonna have that aroma
[SPEAKER_01]: and flavor that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our ongoing research is we're
still looking at other different cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars to understand what makes them
smell different, their own flavor notes
[SPEAKER_01]: and uniqueness, looking more into other
volatile sulfur compounds just because we
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what makes gelatos and OGs
unique doesn't mean we understand
[SPEAKER_01]: everything about this plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's hundreds, if not thousands
different cultivars out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really want to understand what
makes each one unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is just one example of a
different cultivar known as meat breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, there's well over a dozen
different compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are known, they're in the normal NIST
mass spec database, others are newly
[SPEAKER_01]: identified or still structurally unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these challenges are due to
the fact that these are such low
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations, you can't always
necessarily detect them and it requires
[SPEAKER_01]: other types of techniques to enrich them
on your GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in conclusion, we've identified a
new class of compounds correlating with
[SPEAKER_01]: that gassy skunkier of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all in super low concentrations,
but they have big aromatic impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concentration is around part per
billion or part per trillion, which does
[SPEAKER_01]: have that issue with detection limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see an increase in these can of sulfur
concentrations at the end of flowering and
[SPEAKER_01]: curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do see them make it through into
different types of extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the future work was we really
understand is what are the potential
[SPEAKER_01]: medical properties of these?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have any?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it good or bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any impact on the entourage
effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the genetic explanation for why
some cultivars produce these compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but others don't?
[SPEAKER_01]: We see this in a lot of OGs and gelatos
and modern exotics, but not really in any
[SPEAKER_01]: turpentine rich like hazes and jackhares.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a genetic reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it some other reasoning for why it's
not produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what other possible can of sulfur
compounds are in cannabis that we've yet
[SPEAKER_01]: to detect?
[SPEAKER_01]: These could have potentially really
important impacts for flavor, aroma,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also medical or potential mood
enhancement of the experience of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I'd like to acknowledge my
team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian, Marcos, Ryan, and Kevin from
Abstracts did a lot of incredible work on
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out and thanks to Abstracts for
funding this and always encouraging and
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting us with publishing our research
and making sure we get it out there to
[SPEAKER_01]: help educate the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to Anthony Buchanan with Marks
International and Cepsolve Analytical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They worked with us a lot on the GC work
on helping develop some methodologies as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as thanks to Josh Del Rosa,
Josh D., Mario Guzman, and Mr. Sierbinski
[SPEAKER_01]: from the cannabis industry for really
helping get us some of those iconic
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars that are important for the
skunky gas aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually very interesting to hear
that it is not all about terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: thials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite contrary to what widely is
believed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You briefly mentioned about the genetic
mechanisms or genes that control in this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, and probably you're going to work
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you please tell us if there is any
work that you have done or any idea of how
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically these specific aromas might be
controlled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with genetically understanding that,
we really don't know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that certain cultivars that are
rich in myrcine, bitacrophene,
[SPEAKER_01]: limonene, pinenes, do produce these kind
of sulfur compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's things like think of any type of
exotics, wedding cake, gelatos,
[SPEAKER_01]: runts, skittles, as classic OGs,
all produce canicil for compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But traditional hazes, jackhares,
and those, almost like those traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: sativas, to be honest, really don't
produce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't do a lot of genomic,
well, we don't do any genomics work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And medicinal genomics obviously does
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we focus a lot on understanding the
volatile secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the things we hope to
find out through collaboration someday.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Following on from that, I think the key
here probably has to do with the
[SPEAKER_02]: ecological role.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not there for our enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, perhaps an ecologist would
have insight into why the plant produces
[SPEAKER_02]: these and may also provide insight into
what role they could have for consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these secondary metabolites are
produced for usually some biological
[SPEAKER_01]: function of their right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some for pest deterrents,
maybe other benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be even a decomposition product
due to some other process, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in hops, we see their polyfunctional
files come from the degradation of
[SPEAKER_01]: different amino acids like cysteine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a possibility here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very reasonable possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
Thanks.
