[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning everybody So I've spent the
last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a doctor now almost 30 years,
but I've spent the last 10 years as a
[SPEAKER_03]: pediatric Cannabis doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also take care of adults when I started
my practice It was mostly adults,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I just wanted to share with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all Some patients of mine that
are using multiple different cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: to enhance the quality of their lives and
these include cancer patients children
[SPEAKER_03]: with genetic diseases children who have
had issues since birth And it's been
[SPEAKER_03]: really very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some other kids as well If you
could see the top middle photo This is a
[SPEAKER_03]: little boy that was never supposed to walk
and he came walking into my office this
[SPEAKER_03]: year So that's kind of amazing the little
boy all the way on your right on the top
[SPEAKER_03]: Said mama for the first time at age six.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anybody who's worried about damaging
little brains with cannabis It doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It appears to actually make brains move
forward So the conditions that I take care
[SPEAKER_03]: of mostly are here Treatment resistant
epilepsy by far is the number one
[SPEAKER_03]: condition I see in pediatrics.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, autism is coming in as a very
close second Unfortunately, I do see
[SPEAKER_03]: children with cancer Most of them are
advanced cancers metastatic who have been
[SPEAKER_03]: giving very poor prognosis And as you can
see the other conditions and one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: things that's very important to understand
is that many of these conditions have an
[SPEAKER_03]: underlying root cause of endocannabinoids
deficiency or dysfunction some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: literature is is bearing out that these
children clearly have an endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: deficiency and I know there's going to be
a talk on autism but just in March of this
[SPEAKER_03]: year Stanford University published a paper
where children with autism had
[SPEAKER_03]: significantly lower anandamide levels when
compared to children who were what we call
[SPEAKER_03]: neurotypical so when a child is missing a
compound in their brain that's supposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: promote Homeostasis I consider it
malpractice not to correct that imbalance
[SPEAKER_03]: Here the rationale for use again evidence
of the endocannabinoid system is root
[SPEAKER_03]: cause despite a recent very recent just
this past Thursday there was a article
[SPEAKER_03]: published in New England Journal of
Medicine about medical marijuana for
[SPEAKER_03]: chronic pain and there was a pro and a con
and The con said we don't know the safety
[SPEAKER_03]: baloney.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know the safety of cannabis thousands
of years Show me the bodies We don't see
[SPEAKER_03]: that so Certainly tolerated well by most
we don't see organ damage the only time I
[SPEAKER_03]: really get concerned is when it's combined
with certain pharmaceuticals, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: in children with epilepsy No question that
the quality of life of these children are
[SPEAKER_03]: being improved if they respond and we do
see like around an 80% response rate,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is pretty good Certainly
compassionate care end of life now that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have tested medicine and there has always
been tested medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't Required here in
California, but now everything that's on
[SPEAKER_03]: the market is pretty is is compliant with
testing I don't have to worry anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get a batch result and I can see
what is in The compounds that the families
[SPEAKER_03]: are using and most importantly with
cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a one-size-fits-all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can customize treatment I will share
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are two children the little boy on
the bottom These are siblings by the way,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the mom sends me these nice little
milestone updates the first day of First
[SPEAKER_03]: grade for Casey on top and her brother
started third grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are both children with epilepsy and
autism They had terrible quality of life
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both on different regimens and
both as you can see are in school and They
[SPEAKER_03]: look pretty happy doing really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Had this really cool animation where
when I click the button the little circles
[SPEAKER_03]: came up But I lost that when I converted
this to a PDF.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm using in in terms of
cannabinoids For patients is I am using
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that is circled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am using CBD extracts THC extracts
the raw cannabinoids THC a CBDA We're also
[SPEAKER_03]: using just newly available Delta 8 THC for
some teenagers with anxiety So all of
[SPEAKER_03]: these and by the way, some other compounds
are available CBN, which I haven't really
[SPEAKER_03]: used very much I haven't found very good
success.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe other people have THC V is now
currently available in California access
[SPEAKER_03]: to all The different cannabinoids is
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some patients on five different
Extracts a day multiple times throughout
[SPEAKER_03]: the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people take certain Cannabinoids in
the morning and some take at night but
[SPEAKER_03]: without the ability to customize or to
have these available and you know I often
[SPEAKER_03]: get asked to talk to families who are out
of state if they don't have access
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we really can't get anywhere
with a condition So let's talk about CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: extracts as Dr. Mishula mentioned this
morning, of course anti convulsant and
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been born out in multiple studies
now We also know that CBD extracts can
[SPEAKER_03]: help with anxiety and aggression and si be
a self-injurious behavior certainly
[SPEAKER_03]: analgesic My own mother is using CBD for
severe arthritis pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been very successful for three
years She's been able to not take any
[SPEAKER_03]: other painkillers Neuro protection even in
the patients that I take care of like the
[SPEAKER_03]: children who may not respond With a great
result with epilepsy the parents still
[SPEAKER_03]: want to continue to give CBD to their
children Despite that it's not lowering
[SPEAKER_03]: seizures They feel that it's protecting
their child's brain and they're seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: that the child isn't losing memory every
time that they have a seizure We also know
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD to be anti-cancer and in general
decreases neuroexcitation Interestingly
[SPEAKER_03]: remember CBD is a stimulant in low doses
and it's more sedating in higher doses and
[SPEAKER_03]: of course this Varies a lot of inter
individual variation But I have found in
[SPEAKER_03]: an autistic population that sometimes the
lower dose is actually aggravate behavior
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we go higher in dose we can
actually get an opposite effect,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a more calming effect Sometimes
that turns people off they may try CBD for
[SPEAKER_03]: their child and usually in a very low dose
They see their child escalate behavior and
[SPEAKER_03]: then they're terrified to use CBD anymore
But remember these compounds are biphasic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to see an opposite effect I
like to divide the CBD into two types of
[SPEAKER_03]: compound or Kind of categories high ratio
CBD to THC and lower ratio CBD to THC and
[SPEAKER_03]: yes, you can see I've listed some ratios
Those are not the only ratios that we use
[SPEAKER_03]: but that is just an example and the reason
I do this is because I find that people
[SPEAKER_03]: often say Okay, I got some CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, is it CBD with a one-to-one or CBD
like a 27 to one because if it's they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to give you different effects and
you cannot compare the two of them and if
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't know what you're doing and you
buy a One-to-one ratio and you go home and
[SPEAKER_03]: you dose it by CBD and you get stoned
You're going to be a little bit turned off
[SPEAKER_03]: to that if you're not looking for that
effect So I do like to categorize and at
[SPEAKER_03]: least again reading labels so that you
understand What is in the product that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're using in children?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've listed the five most common terpenes
that seem to be helpful for both seizures
[SPEAKER_03]: and for autism linalool pineine limonene
beta-karyofaline and So raw cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: have been available now for a number of
years in California I find that both of
[SPEAKER_03]: them are anti convulsant in my clinical
experience anti-inflammatory and also in
[SPEAKER_03]: pediatric patients this list of
improvements that we're seeing which is
[SPEAKER_03]: decreased anxiety improved focus better
speech less stimming in those children
[SPEAKER_03]: that have Autism better sleep better
appetite less aggression.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a picture of Katherine Katherine
Came to me many years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's one of my first pediatric patients
and when I gave her CBD Because that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what was available at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had THC and we had CBD extracts She did
terribly she didn't even last two weeks on
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD oil her seizures were Escalated she
was on three medications.
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought maybe there's a drug
interaction that we weren't accounting for
[SPEAKER_03]: but her family was completely turned off
to it and they were not willing to even go
[SPEAKER_03]: and move any further with it and About a
year later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed her name on my schedule and when
they came in the mom said, you know We
[SPEAKER_03]: tried two more pharmaceuticals and we are
not getting anywhere She was having a
[SPEAKER_03]: significant number of seizures every week
and tremendous anxiety related.
[SPEAKER_03]: She felt Every seizure coming so we call
that an aura and it would create
[SPEAKER_03]: tremendous anxiety for her which then
created tremendous anxiety in the family
[SPEAKER_03]: and When she came back to see me we had
some new information about THC a and so we
[SPEAKER_03]: started her on that and She had about 30%
reduction of seizures and complete
[SPEAKER_03]: resolution of what the aura is So the
mother said the quality of life was
[SPEAKER_03]: tremendously improved and when CVDA became
available we added that into the regimen
[SPEAKER_03]: and right now I'll tell you she's 50%
reduced on seizures.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's been able to wean off a very
difficult drug called Amphi that's almost
[SPEAKER_03]: impossible to wean off of and she's had no
rebound seizures from the weaning and in
[SPEAKER_03]: general her quality life has really been
improved and Again, that's just on rock
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't take CBD or THC All right THC
extracts, you know, I read something about
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody saying that Children,
of course don't use THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they do in my practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do I do find that there it is an
added anti-convulsant effect for some
[SPEAKER_03]: patients I in fact have one patient who
the only thing that works to stop his
[SPEAKER_03]: seizures is THC if you were going to
design a drug for a child who may need to
[SPEAKER_03]: be on this medication for long-term THC
May develop tolerance over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not the greatest But what we found
with this patient is that we've got the
[SPEAKER_03]: seizures so well controlled that we can
back up a little bit on some days Skip a
[SPEAKER_03]: dose maybe take a break for a day and then
restart to try to keep the tolerance down
[SPEAKER_03]: in general though The child has no
intoxication intoxication.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's at a pretty low dose, but it's made a
big difference in his seizures I also find
[SPEAKER_03]: THC to be very helpful when weaning the
pharmaceuticals AED stands for
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-epilepsy drugs Also what parents will
tell us and remember if your child has an
[SPEAKER_03]: end of my deficiency or an endocannabinoid
deficiency giving THC can help replace
[SPEAKER_03]: that deficiency and So what we are seeing
is improvements reported in you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: focus speech less stimming better sleep
ever appetite decreased anxiety I find THC
[SPEAKER_03]: in general to be very well tolerated one
of the things I explained to every family
[SPEAKER_03]: is that every person has a ceiling dose
and what we do is we start extremely Low
[SPEAKER_03]: and we titrate up if you if they see their
child starting to have any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: intoxicating effects We've now hit the
ceiling dose and the goal is really to
[SPEAKER_03]: stay under that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we're not we're not looking to
intoxicate children So the low
[SPEAKER_03]: concentration products 5 milligrams per ml
and 10 milligrams per ml everything and
[SPEAKER_03]: basically standardized 1 ml syringe which
is easy to measure and give to a child I
[SPEAKER_03]: find allows us to explore THC and very low
accurate doses with very little unwanted
[SPEAKER_03]: effects Now CBG is fairly new on the
market CBG stands for cannabigerol And I
[SPEAKER_03]: have to thank a group called whole plant
access for autism and there's they have a
[SPEAKER_03]: poster in a booth So definitely check them
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on their advisory board.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a nonprofit group that helps
families with autism There's over 8,000
[SPEAKER_03]: families involved with them They pointed
out to me that CBG was out on the market
[SPEAKER_03]: and there were some families using it so I
delved into the research and I I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to go through it all since time is
limited But if you can take a picture and
[SPEAKER_03]: then take a look at these articles but
what's interesting is that CBG appears to
[SPEAKER_03]: work at different mechanisms then excuse
me some of the other compounds and What
[SPEAKER_03]: we're finding and let me show you this
slide is that they did a survey of 35
[SPEAKER_03]: families and as you can see the dominant
effects and these 35 families of children
[SPEAKER_03]: with autism were mostly beneficial so you
can see 31 out of 35 of the children had
[SPEAKER_03]: better mood Increase in speech decrease in
anxiety increase in focus increase in
[SPEAKER_03]: social interaction decrease in
hyperactivity increase in sleep better
[SPEAKER_03]: appetite Decrease in some pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of amazing that that when you
look at the top half of this Graph you can
[SPEAKER_03]: see that the dominant effects in this
particular group of patients is quite
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial and what we're finding with CBG
is it is an antidepressant anti-anxiety
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely changes mood also works as an
analgesic and anti-inflammatory So I have
[SPEAKER_03]: started using this in patients many of the
patients are combining it with other
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids And again, I mentioned this
yesterday at a Q&A that I attended in that
[SPEAKER_03]: combination cannabinoids seems to be very
helpful for these children who have Such
[SPEAKER_03]: devastating illness in terms of dosing
CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: It appears to be fairly low dose between 2
and 20 milligrams per day It can be
[SPEAKER_03]: stimulating for some so some of these
patients were only doing it in the morning
[SPEAKER_03]: because If they take it in the evening,
they will stay up all night, which is of
[SPEAKER_03]: course opposite of what we're interested
in And there is a report of a young adult
[SPEAKER_03]: that was shared through me through this
Facebook group who had Tourette syndrome
[SPEAKER_03]: and he decided to try low doses all the
way up to about 100 milligrams and he
[SPEAKER_03]: found That he had complete resolution of
his ticks between 25 and 40 milligram
[SPEAKER_03]: dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very interesting In that in my
experience with most patients with
[SPEAKER_03]: Tourette you have to have a fair amount of
THC and he does supplement with THC but in
[SPEAKER_03]: this way he might be able to use both so
he doesn't have to take as much THC and So
[SPEAKER_03]: I I got through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have plenty of time for questions
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your work in your
presentation Is there a suppository of
[SPEAKER_00]: information that helps with pediatrics?
[SPEAKER_00]: weaning from certain synthetics other sort
of pharmaceutical drugs Or are you finding
[SPEAKER_00]: it more just specific to specific diseases
that you've spoken about?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in pediatrics the the drugs that we're
mostly weaning from our Anti-seizure drugs
[SPEAKER_03]: or sometimes the children are taking
Either a bill of fire or a respirator for
[SPEAKER_03]: autism All of these drugs are usually very
difficult to get off of in general What
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned is that you know different
doctors learn different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no one absolute way In fact,
one of my friends is a neurologist He he
[SPEAKER_03]: was taught a certain way In one program
and then he went to another program and
[SPEAKER_03]: they taught him a different way to do it
So I do think it's really a physician's
[SPEAKER_03]: preference in general I tell patients if
they're especially if they're doing well
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis medicine not to go fast
Don't rock the boat once we're actually
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing some good results So I tell
patients to to wean 10% or less Over a
[SPEAKER_03]: period of somewhere between two and four
weeks to do it slowly Especially as we
[SPEAKER_03]: move up on the cannabinoid Treatment we
can kind of go slowly down.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason to rip away drugs from a
child who's actually finally got some
[SPEAKER_03]: stability That's my approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure Two minutes remaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is about the CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that yesterday at the CME Talks
that we had cannabinoids were suggested in
[SPEAKER_01]: place and without THC so to speak or for
those that have schizophrenia or bipolar
[SPEAKER_01]: and On that slide CBG seems that it was
also a possibility for improvement of
[SPEAKER_01]: antidepressant and anxiety Do you have
any?
[SPEAKER_01]: Negative side effects for CBG with
schizophrenia or bipolar that you know of
[SPEAKER_03]: right now So I haven't I've only treated
one bipolar patient with CBG who was
[SPEAKER_03]: already a patient doing well on a CBD
dominant oil when we added in CBG she felt
[SPEAKER_03]: that it was actually helping her more in
combination in terms of Complete
[SPEAKER_03]: elimination of the things like kind of
paralyzing anxiety that she still had
[SPEAKER_03]: breakthroughs with I've not treated
anybody with schizophrenia with CBG But I
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly think it would be interesting to
try was that patient on any anti-psychotic
[SPEAKER_03]: Medications.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was a patient who had already
weaned off all Pharmaceuticals and was
[SPEAKER_03]: doing well on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you We've got ten seconds Bonnie in
your regimen and dosing recommendation To
[SPEAKER_02]: children in your THC versus THC acid one
minute a How do you really go about
[SPEAKER_02]: determining?
[SPEAKER_02]: That spread between the acid part and the
THC molecule, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's a huge inter
individual variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody responds differently So in
general I use the same kind of motto that
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody uses which is start low and Tie
trade up and of course remember this is
[SPEAKER_03]: out of pocket medicine and can be quite
expensive So what we're trying to do Is
[SPEAKER_03]: find the lowest dose to give the desired
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty much with THC I'm starting
usually at a half a milligram to a
[SPEAKER_03]: milligram Per day or per dose depending on
the condition and for THC a I would say
[SPEAKER_03]: it's probably two milligrams or sometimes
even under that for a patient with
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepsy Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everybody
