[SPEAKER_00]: Drifting gears a little bit here to talk
about the poster that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: presenting that's about using psilocybin
to treat cannabis dependency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk with me a bit about sort of the
genesis of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you first get interested in
studying this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the poster we're doing is from a
project that we did in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to see if microdosing psilocybin
can help people who struggle with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: dependency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know people in the industry are like
say that cannabis does not have any
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's 100% safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on our side in helping our patients,
we come across a lot of people who have an
[SPEAKER_01]: unhealthy relationship with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started we started offering
microdosing as part of our business back
[SPEAKER_01]: in May.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in doing that, we had patients report
that they were like inadvertently
[SPEAKER_01]: decreasing their cannabis use alongside
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that oftentimes and that's well
researched, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the decrease in cannabis is not well
researched.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like, could microdosing help
people improve their relationship with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and depend on it less the same way
that we see other, you know, other
[SPEAKER_01]: substance addictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of put it out there like let's
let's get a group of eight people and
[SPEAKER_01]: let's try this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found eight people who were willing to
try this group program that we had put
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a six week six week program
where we use microdosing group support.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a group tolerance break together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provided a ton of education.
[SPEAKER_01]: We even did a mini dose session where
people got to they could consume up to two
[SPEAKER_01]: grams of psilocybin during that session.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had a group chat as well
during that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results were astounding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were already using psilocybin
microdosing to treat different conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and sort of just saw the reduction in
cannabis as a welcome side effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we were seeing like being
reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then alongside of that, we have people
coming to us saying, like, I have I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: using all this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I cut down?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just wanted to see if this could be
an effective tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, not not a cure or anything like
that, but a tool for people to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you say an unhealthy
relationship with cannabis, what does that
[SPEAKER_01]: look like in the people who are in the
group?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like they could not get through
the day without, you know, without sucking
[SPEAKER_01]: on their vape pen multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like people could not travel
because they could they feared that they
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't have access to their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like the slightest inconvenience
would make them turn to their vape pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was people who were just not they
wanted a different relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want to have to depend on it
so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help them feel normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was one person who was
showing early signs of CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, she had like early morning nausea.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, see, it's just interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually just spoke with Ethan Russo,
who did a study on CHS all about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that just seems awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing a lot of that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with some other professionals
in the space and we're doing our research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing our own survey also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what methods of support are available,
were available for cannabis over
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption or cannabis dependency kind of
before you explored this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that or how does that compare
to, you know, alcohol or tobacco sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: well understood dependencies?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There does exist, like, you know,
marijuana anonymous groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been to those, so I don't know a
whole lot about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume that they follow the same 12 step
program, maybe that Etholix Anonymous
[SPEAKER_01]: does.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are there are some Facebook groups,
but a lot of times it's like a silent
[SPEAKER_01]: people suffer in silence a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're afraid to admit that their
cannabis use is problematic because they
[SPEAKER_01]: have all these people saying cannabis is
this amazing, wonderful medicine and a
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like shame on you for having a problem
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not addictive, which is all
completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they're just kind of like
suffering in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not a whole lot of support out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
