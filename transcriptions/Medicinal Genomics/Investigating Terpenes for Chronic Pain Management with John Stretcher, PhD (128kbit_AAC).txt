[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the Senior Marketing Manager at
Medicinal Genomics and proud member of the
[SPEAKER_01]: team that puts on the CanMed Innovation
and Investment Summit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, registration for CanMed 25 is now
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out canmedevents.com to see details
about next year's event and the new
[SPEAKER_01]: location at the Wyndham Resort in Rio
Grande, Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you check out the ticket packages page,
you'll be happy to see that the price for
[SPEAKER_01]: the full summit package is lower than
CanMed 24, but that package still includes
[SPEAKER_01]: three nights at the resort, full access to
three days of CanMed presentations,
[SPEAKER_01]: workshops, and networking events,
meals, and cocktails, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The event's in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you do, but it's never too early to
purchase your ticket package for CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only will you take advantage of early
bird pricing, which gets you another $500
[SPEAKER_01]: off the full summit package, but you'll
also get the satisfaction that comes with
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing something off of your to-do list.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dr. John Stryker.
[SPEAKER_01]: John is a professor in the Department of
Pharmacology in the College of Medicine at
[SPEAKER_01]: the University of Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has built a long-term research program
focused on finding improved treatments for
[SPEAKER_01]: pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has encompassed multiple approaches
over the years, including testing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid
constituents of cannabis, identifying new
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to target the opioid receptor
signaling, and identifying new receptor
[SPEAKER_01]: targets in the body for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: His lab works on both the basic science
knowledge of how these systems work and
[SPEAKER_01]: also works to create new drugs for human
therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: During our conversation, we discussed the
basics of terpenes, what they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: and their role in cannabis, the
cannabimimetic effects of terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: their synergistic effects with
cannabinoids, what levels of terpenes are
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to get a therapeutic effect,
a recent study showing terpenes can
[SPEAKER_01]: relieve chronic neuropathic pain,
combining terpenes with other drugs such
[SPEAKER_01]: as opioids to get better pain relief at
lower doses, and which terpenes provide
[SPEAKER_01]: the best pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
John, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Healer.com.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr. John
[SPEAKER_01]: Stryker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate the invite.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm excited to talk with you today
about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've talked about terpenes in a
couple other previous episodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: how they contribute to cannabis aroma,
how they influence a user's experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: even how they're analyzed, but we've yet
to really dive into the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of terpenes, at least not as like
standalone compounds, which is what I
[SPEAKER_01]: think what makes your recent study and
your abstract so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often terpenes are seen as contributors to
the entourage effect with other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, but your work suggests that
they may have therapeutic effects on their
[SPEAKER_01]: own, which is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get too deep into that,
for those in the audience who perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't seen those previous episodes on
terpenes, could you give us an overview of
[SPEAKER_01]: what they are and what their role is in
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ben, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes themselves are not unique to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are small molecules that are
found in essentially all plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least all plants that I know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes them kind of unique for
cannabis is there's a lot of them in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, more of them than there are,
tend to be in other plants like hops or
[SPEAKER_00]: pine or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is a terpene?
[SPEAKER_00]: A terpene is a small, simple molecule,
like it's small, very aromatic,
[SPEAKER_00]: very small, very hydrophobic slash
lipophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So small molecules and we've sort of known
about these molecules for many years
[SPEAKER_00]: because, as you just said, they add to the
taste and aroma of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have something like,
you know, even if you don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are, you kind of still experience
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you smell that fresh lemony smell from
a real lemon, not the stuff that comes in
[SPEAKER_00]: a can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's d-limonene,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smell that smell coming off of hops,
that's alpha-humulene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the pine tree smell,
that's beta-pinene and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've all experienced terpenes,
even if you haven't run across that term
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in terms of what they do in
cannabis, yes, of course, they add to that
[SPEAKER_00]: unique aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, parenthetically, they actually
are not what give cannabis that real
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've actually isolated, or we're not
the ones that isolated, our collaborators
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated that compound called pyrinol
thiol, working with it separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually has different activity than
either the terpenes or the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just kind of a side note there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not exactly that skunky smell,
but some of the other tastes and aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: elements of the plant are from these
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course, for many years now,
people have been looking, we sort of knew
[SPEAKER_00]: that it did this taste and aroma,
but people have suspected that these have
[SPEAKER_00]: had therapeutic and pharmacological
effects going back some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those have been under active
investigation in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as also as you suggested,
people have suggested that these terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that the terpenes might somehow
combine with the cannabinoids to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: an effect unique to the plant that you
wouldn't get from either one purified
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there were sort of all these ideas
floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There had been some studies, particularly
in pain, suggesting that terpenes could
[SPEAKER_00]: relieve pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even clinical studies had shown this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were some real limitations in
the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there still is no solid evidence
whether or not the entourage effect
[SPEAKER_00]: actually occurs in like a cannabis extract
that you yourself are taking or smoking or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of surveyed this landscape
in about 2020, because when we started our
[SPEAKER_00]: work in this, we said, OK, there's a lot
of suggestions, but not a lot of hard
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's drill down and figure out what
these molecules are actually doing rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than just kind of throwing around ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started by isolating the
terpenes and studying each one
[SPEAKER_00]: individually rather than, as you say,
combined into this kind of this mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: this extract so that we could really
figure out what each one does alone before
[SPEAKER_00]: we start looking at them in combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've published that initial work
in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021 showing that the terpenes have what
we call a cannabimimetic effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they behaviorally they look like a
cannabinoid, although they are not a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their mechanism is a little bit
different than a typical cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, it produced some of these
same effects in animals like sedation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of couch lock or couch high that
you get, catalepsy, a decrease in body
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, pain relief, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it had these effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, in terms of the
entourage effect, when we combined the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene with a cannabinoid, a synthetic
cannabinoid, we got a higher impact than
[SPEAKER_00]: either one alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what got us the most
attention in 2021 was this idea that the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes were having this effect and that
the effect could be greater when you
[SPEAKER_00]: combine them with a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what really got our journey
started in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do terpenes interact with the human
body, particularly in relation to pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so that is still, you know,
really a big unknown question,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not completely unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been, as I mentioned,
clinical studies, other studies showing
[SPEAKER_00]: that the terpenes relieve pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even like, say, a study where they
would give a little to laboring women,
[SPEAKER_00]: like women in labor giving birth,
and it showed that they had this benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other studies looking at
chronic pain patients and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the terpene, you see this benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still, even when you know
that, there's still a lot of unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, like we all know that
terpenes have a strong smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that humans have a strong
placebo effect when they're exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: what they think is a medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I haven't seen any well controlled
studies that suggest that the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: effect is separate from the placebo
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mechanism is also unknown,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how this, if it is relieving
pain, how it's relieving pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we try to tackle in
our own work by, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: working with mice who do not kind of have
this expectation that a human being does,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, we are injecting the
terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they couldn't get like that aroma or
that smell to sort of confound the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at the mice and then also
figuring out mechanism and diving in and
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out exactly what these are
interacting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least in mice, we now have data
that suggests that these terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulating the cannabinoid receptors in
your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of the known cannabinoids that are
going to be, or sorry, known cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors that are going to be stimulated
by drugs like THC and also your endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that your own body produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that they can bind to and
activate a receptor called the adenosine
[SPEAKER_00]: A2A receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is one of those targets
all of you know about, even if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: never heard that word before, because
that's the same receptor that's targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: by caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've all stimulated or inhibited our
adenosine A2A receptors, whether you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it or not, because we do it through
caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the terpenes stimulate,
at least in the mice, this receptor to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a strong pain relief in a chronic
and neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of things that you touched on
there that I thought was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the placebo effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to think, especially like you
mentioned, I mean, these are aromatic
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be hard to sort of have a placebo
of that compound without it actually being
[SPEAKER_01]: the real thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's ways to potentially get around
that that I've been thinking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different ways to take
terpenes and, indeed, cannabis and other
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we wanted to take away that
part, we might say encapsulate it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm working with a company right
now called Black Rock Nutraceuticals that
[SPEAKER_00]: are developing an encapsulated as well as
tinctured form of a beta-karyophylline
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to be testing in animals
and then eventually human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be one way to get around
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that change the bioavailability,
whether or not you're inhaling it versus
[SPEAKER_01]: ingesting it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it very well might.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that touches on another problem in the
terpene field is that there are very few,
[SPEAKER_00]: if really any, studies that I can find
that actually look at the bioavailability
[SPEAKER_00]: and the pharmacokinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason perhaps for that is
that we found it's pretty challenging to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to do these pharmacokinetic
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having trouble detecting the
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you had previously discussed
how to sort of measure these molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use gas chromatography,
mass spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lot of trouble getting it to
work consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're just idiots in not doing it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that suggests there could be a reason
perhaps why there are so few PK studies on
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes in the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another thing you mentioned is
that these terpenes, they're stimulating
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the same receptors that
cannabinoids are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is that at similar levels or are the
cannabinoids stimulating more?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that sort of compare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pound for pound at equivalent levels of
potency, the terpenes are stimulating
[SPEAKER_00]: less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're what we would call a partial
agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whereas something actually,
THC is technically a partial agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whereas something like a 2-AG,
those are going to be full agonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm trying to think if there's a
synthetic cannabinoid that everyone would
[SPEAKER_00]: be familiar with, it might be a full
agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, THC is the closest to it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are going to stimulate,
let's say, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're getting with the terpenes
is more like 50% to 60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would need higher concentrations of
the terpenes to get a similar effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have to use fairly high
concentrations both in animal models when
[SPEAKER_00]: we inject, as well as in cell culture
models when we're actually looking at how
[SPEAKER_00]: the receptor itself is stimulated by these
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that leads into another issue when
you're evaluating the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've gotten this criticism in our
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, OK, you had to give a high
amount of terpenes to the animals or to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells in order to see these effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an actual extract from real cannabis,
the levels of terpene are fairly low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not at this high level where
you're going to get a high dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we have this entourage effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even if that's true, to me,
it's actually not that important because
[SPEAKER_00]: we can design these drugs or extracts,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can design them however we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can put in higher levels of terpenes
to sort of harness this entourage-like
[SPEAKER_00]: effect or whatever you want to call it in
order to help people treat their pain
[SPEAKER_00]: better or whatever they need it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is the criticism more that evidence
for their entourage effect in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: itself, that the terpenes are at such a
low level we can't really attribute an
[SPEAKER_01]: effect to them in kind of a natural
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the criticism of my work
specifically that I've run into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we kind of answer by saying,
well, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at what these molecules do
on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therapeutically, we can design whatever we
want in order to help someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the criticism of my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then more broadly, there's just a lack
of, no, not a total lack, but a general
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of investigation into this phenomena
in the scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go online and find lots of
people who will tell you the entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effect is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to name any names,
but you put this terpene in your extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get these effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really not a lot or perhaps any
evidence for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, again, part of our
motivation for doing this work is to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of fill in those gaps, put some scientific
backing behind the claims that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: made in the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you mentioned that you were doing
some studies in mice or rats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk a little bit more about that and kind
of what's the next stage beyond what
[SPEAKER_01]: you've done so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I briefly described our initial
research published in 2021 showing that
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes are sort of cannabinoid-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so indeed, we were giving those to
mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this battery of behavioral tests we
give in mice, because you can't just ask a
[SPEAKER_00]: mouse, hey, how high are you right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You feeling it, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these behavioral tests that we
run in the mice that cannabinoids produce
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of these typical behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we found that they're
cannabinoid-like, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, perhaps more impactfully
recently, just a month or two ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: we continued this work publishing another
paper showing the impact of the terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: on chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not cannabinoid-like, not a sort of
a tail flick pain, which is the analgesic
[SPEAKER_00]: assay that we run that's more like hand on
a hot stove pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is trying to get it real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to kill patients who are
suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, we used a model called
chemotherapy-induced peripheral
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that have cancer, they go on
these chemotherapy drugs like Paclitaxel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those help the cancer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of those patients, even a
majority of those patients, get some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of chronic neuropathic pain, sort of this
burning, numb, electric-shooting style
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, usually in the hands and the feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some of those patients,
it never goes away, even after they stop
[SPEAKER_00]: taking their Paclitaxel or whatever the
chemotherapy drug is, even after the
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pain is really difficult to
treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not well-treated by opioids or other
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to, again, test a model
that's gonna be relevant to real people
[SPEAKER_00]: and their concerns, tested the terpenes in
that model, and we found that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: highly effective in relieving this type of
neuropathic chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got strong pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, this work hasn't been
published yet, but we also looked in other
[SPEAKER_00]: pain models too, like a post-surgical pain
model, a fibromyalgia-like pain model,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then, oh, an inflammatory pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like strong inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one I wasn't thinking of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so four different chronic pain models,
all of them relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes produce strong pain relief in all
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have further dug into a
mechanism that's published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can read this if they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's in mice, as you mentioned,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is exciting, but this is in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do we take it next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientifically, we want to further expand
or explore turning these into actual
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's gonna go through several paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: One path is gonna be scientific,
figuring out what is their mechanism,
[SPEAKER_00]: like exactly what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the Adenosine A2A receptor,
like how are they stimulating that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like in your spinal
cord?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the neuronal circuits that are
being activated to relieve pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also gonna do more
therapeutic-based investigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not enough that a drug
relieves pain to be a good drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has to have tolerable or
preferably low or no side effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a drug that relieves your
pain, but makes you absolutely miserable,
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't do anyone any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did some of this side effect
testing, looking at tolerance and
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction liability, and they have no
addiction liability in our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we have some unpublished research
suggesting that terpenes can block the
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction liability of opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's an exciting future direction
that we're pursuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to look at other side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure this isn't making the animals
and thus you feel miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure it's not toxic and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to think it is,
but all of that has to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the third sort of pathway is
to bring this to the clinic, to real
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here at the University of Arizona,
we have a very active clinical research
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can work with physicians here that
do that type of research to get these
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes into patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as terpenes go, we have a big
advantage in doing that because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't some new drug that we
whipped up in the lab that we invented,
[SPEAKER_00]: that has to go through all this extensive
safety, toxicity testing before it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: approved by the Food and Drug
Administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes are already on the FDA list
of what's called generally regarded as
[SPEAKER_00]: safe, GRAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus we can take these right into the
clinic and give them to people without,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it still has to be approved by the
institution and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can take them right into people
without having to have that approval from
[SPEAKER_00]: the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to shorten that timeline
by a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, there are already been
some clinical studies with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll be looking at their impact in
chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as part of that, we also want to make
sure that they can be delivered well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've already brought up the issue of
pharmacokinetics and bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working to also tweak the
formulation to make sure that it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be stable, that it's going to get into
the brain and the spinal cord and do what
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs to do without being broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what are you thinking would be the
method of ingestion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be oral or inhaled?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're exploring all options right now,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, we did this injected,
but we also have tested oral delivery as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as an inhaled version as well,
all with the mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, we found that the oral
and the inhaled had less bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even at a high dose, it wasn't
producing very much of an effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a small effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of our work needs to be to
figure out if this is also a limitation in
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it is a limitation in humans,
ways to get around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned we're working with
companies, one of them being BlackRock,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's others, to come up with
well-formulated terpene drugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: therapies that will hopefully avoid any of
these issues and help people get the
[SPEAKER_00]: relief they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I jotted down the question,
but I feel like you kind of answered it
[SPEAKER_01]: when you were kind of explaining how one
of the benefits with using terpenes is
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're generally regarded as safe
and you don't have to kind of go through
[SPEAKER_01]: that new drug development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is the goal really to kind of come up
with a therapeutic that is just terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: and not sort of in combination with
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, again, there's room to have a
lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's definitely a space for
a pure terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our work suggests that should be
beneficial, particularly geraniol and
[SPEAKER_00]: lidlul are the ones in our hands that have
the lowest side effects and the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: pain relief capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus you could make like an extract or
a formula related capsule or a tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could do under your tongue or
perhaps a vaporization cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these options are out there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But our work suggests that these drugs can
be more effective when combined with
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of that paper we recently
published, we did a low dose of terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: with a low dose of opioid and we got
higher pain relief than either one alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the terpene was making the opioid or
perhaps the opioid making the terpene,
[SPEAKER_00]: who knows, more effective in relieving
that pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you can give a lower dose of
each, you're decreasing the side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so decreased potential of that opioid
giving you constipation, tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: somnolence, where you can't get to sleep,
nausea, and of course addiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that everyone's most
concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, as I mentioned, we have data
now unpublished, but still data we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actively working on the lab suggesting
that terpenes, at least beta-karyophylline
[SPEAKER_00]: will block that rewarding property of
opioid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm envisioning like a combination
therapy where you take say
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-karyophylline with an opioid of some
kind, you're gonna get better pain relief,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it, hopefully make it non-addictive
and perhaps decrease some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that 2021 paper, we combined the opioid
or sorry, the terpene with a cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes with a cannabinoid and saw that
increased pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a place for that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our combination studies are sort of still
in their infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're mostly focused on the pure terpenes,
but that's an area of big development that
we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're gonna be pursuing in the
years to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, and you mentioned that terpenes have
been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the essential oils that you
purchased, I mean, those are terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why do you think that they haven't been
studied as a therapeutic really to this
[SPEAKER_01]: point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have somewhat, and there are a
lot of papers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wanna short anyone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or kind of be insulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of papers out there but
they were still limited, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, we're gonna take a terpene
or a terpene extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna give a certain amount to
patients and then we see the pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for whatever reason, I don't fully
understand why those next steps weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are the side effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the pharmacokinetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the minimal dose that we need to be
effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really like formalize and systematize
this investigation so you could really
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it into something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just spit balling here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any evidence for that,
but like one of the reasons could be
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's generally regarded as safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can't get a drug company
interested in making a product because
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't patent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I've been working,
all the companies that I've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: with in this space are all smaller
companies, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about cannabis, they care about
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not looking to be Pfizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's why they're the ones that are
willing to tackle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's why they haven't been
tackled in the past with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could also be the possibility that
funding has been harder to come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to get funding from this
work from a portion of the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Institutes of Health, the NIH,
called the National Center for
[SPEAKER_00]: Complementary and Integrative Health,
the NCCIH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a sub part of the NIH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had this program where they were
specifically interested in looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I will say just in general,
the cannabis field, cannabinoid field has
[SPEAKER_00]: grown a lot recently, the last 10 or so
years, all of that has grown and funding
[SPEAKER_00]: has become more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are becoming more interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of these minor components or
understudied components of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, like terpenes and the minor
cannabinoids, those have also been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: very strongly as well with that interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the time is just here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, so as we mentioned too,
terpenes, they're not exclusive to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in other plants and there are
other sources for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they can be synthetically derived
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the terpenes that you're working with
or even in the vision of what you think
[SPEAKER_01]: the therapeutics will eventually be,
will they be derived from cannabis or some
[SPEAKER_01]: other way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have some reason to believe
that the chemical diversity of terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: that you get from cannabis seems to be
better than from other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other plants will have a couple of
terpenes that are sort of dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis tends to have a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least 10 or 15 measurable terpenes in
the extracts that we're looking at and
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of that might come down
to the economics and the legal landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm interested in, but not fully an
expert in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so obviously there are companies out
there that can work with hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, that falls under the 0.3% level for
the farm bill and can get these
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: But economically, maybe it would make more
sense to take it from hops or synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will add to that that we mostly work
with purified terpenes, but we have done
[SPEAKER_00]: some terpene blend work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we take these extracts that are
purified from cannabis, different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars of cannabis, and those mixes are
also highly effective in relieving pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That work is not yet published,
but we're working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe there's a specific
justification to take the terpene as a
[SPEAKER_00]: blend, as an extract from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, just economically
speaking, I think it's generally easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a bunch of plants and extract from
plants than to, say, synthesize all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this in a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even at the concentrations that you're
looking to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's easy to process 100 kilograms,
200 kilograms, ton, two tons of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material versus that's relatively easy to
process large amounts of plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: versus having to get in the lab and
synthesize it and figure out the synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have these giant bioreactors and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And extraction is simpler generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now thinking maybe a little bit more
practically, or maybe for folks who are
[SPEAKER_01]: out there who are trying to use cannabis
or terpenes to manage their pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: are there certain terpenes or combinations
thereof that they could potentially be
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for in products that might be more
beneficial based on the work that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't want to overstate things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the work is in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've still got a long ways to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want everyone to keep that in mind
when you're evaluating this and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially considering trying it for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, as I mentioned,
all of these terpenes are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're generally regarded as safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very unlikely to hurt you to play
around with some of these products that
[SPEAKER_00]: are available and see if it helps for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, some of the patients
that we've worked with through my
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators, my commercial
collaborators, say they get great pain
[SPEAKER_00]: relief that nothing else has worked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think there's anything wrong
with trying it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's things to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, there's a lot of
companies that say a lot of stuff because
[SPEAKER_00]: this is sort of in the natural product
supplement space really is how most of
[SPEAKER_00]: this gets produced and marketed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means that there's not a lot
of regulation and work that the company
[SPEAKER_00]: has to do to prove that their products
have what they say they have in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, they don't really have to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are companies that are
interested in being reliable and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to find those companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask them, how do you evaluate your
terpene levels in your products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, well, we send it to this lab and
they do mass spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you find someone that validates
their work to produce a high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product, that's the first thing I'd look
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of individual terpenes,
beta-cariophylline seems to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: common.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our hands, it's certainly good at
relieving pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the terpene we found that blocks
the opioid reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't recommend anyone start taking
opioids on my show, but that's the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that we suggest could block the opioid
reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then geraniol and linalool in our
hands are also some of the best single
[SPEAKER_00]: product terpenes in terms of relieving
pain with low side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a ton of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's literally hundreds of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other at least dozens that
are sort of available commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see names like eugenol or
bisabol, all these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't evaluate them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, at the end of the day,
try to find a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does, nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you mentioned, there are a lot of
terpenes, a lot of terpenes in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot to be investigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of work yet to be done,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: John, before I let you go, I want to give
you the opportunity, if there's other
[SPEAKER_01]: resources that you think the audience
might find useful, if they want to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: more about this topic or even if there's
links or other papers that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: published, definitely you can mention them
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a link.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put them in the show description as
well so people can learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have some published work on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned, I've kind of been describing
some of it as I go along.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some published work on the
minor cannabinoids, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: another interesting area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like cannabinol and
cannabigerol and some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can publish links to all that people
can read at their leisure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as larger resources, there are not
yet a lot of those resources available,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're trying to build them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a big announcement went out at the
NIH looking for people to establish a
[SPEAKER_00]: national cannabis center that would sort
of provide information to the public and
[SPEAKER_00]: be sort of a central clearinghouse for
data and knowledge about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to research it, how to, you know,
give it to prescribe it to patients and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That center is not yet in existence,
but we got a very good score in our
[SPEAKER_00]: application to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a very good chance that you're
going to be hearing about this national
[SPEAKER_00]: center in the next year or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your ears open for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the meantime, we have a
comprehensive center for pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction at the University of Arizona
that also provides a lot of resources and
[SPEAKER_00]: links to scientists and clinicians and
physicians and public health professionals
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on, all that work in pain,
addiction, opioids, and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can have all of that available for
all of you to check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, that center that you
were talking about, that sounds really
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting and something that's long
overdue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long overdue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we hope to see some news on that
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks again for this, for sharing
this great research that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to see you down in Can Med next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm planning on being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
