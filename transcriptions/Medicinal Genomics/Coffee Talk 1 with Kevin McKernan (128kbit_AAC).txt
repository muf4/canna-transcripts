[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing, who will be part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the CanMed 2020 conference in Pasadena,
California, this September 20th through
[SPEAKER_01]: 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a great episode for you today,
as I had the chance to talk with medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics chief scientific officer,
Kevin McKernan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin is a legend in genomic sequencing,
going back to his days working on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Human Genome Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has applied his experience and
knowledge to trying to better understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis genome, which, as he mentions
in our conversation, is one of the hardest
[SPEAKER_01]: genomes to figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much so, that many of the top minds in
genetic sequencing have collaborated to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to solve this cannabis genome problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you'll see from our
conversation that collaboration is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that Kevin is very passionate
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's no surprise then, that Kevin and
the team at medicinal genomics and at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time, core gen life sciences, came up with
the idea for the CanMed conference,
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide a place where cannabis
researchers and clinicians could come
[SPEAKER_01]: together, share their data, and learn from
one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you'd like to learn from the
leading minds in cannabis science,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, medicine, and safety testing,
you should definitely join us at CanMed
[SPEAKER_01]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: Head over to canmedevents.com to learn all
about the event and to buy your full
[SPEAKER_01]: conference ticket at our special $420
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For just $420, you'll get access to two
days of oral and poster presentations,
[SPEAKER_01]: our expanded exhibit hall, coffee and
lunch stations, networking events,
[SPEAKER_01]: and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That $420 price is more than half off the
full price, but the offer is only
[SPEAKER_01]: available through April 20th, so get your
tickets today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I would be remiss to not mention the
COVID-19 pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we all hope that you and yours are
safe and healthy during this difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This global health crisis has certainly
changed life at CanMed events and
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal genomics, and for me personally,
as I record this from my home.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I apologize in advance if any
ambient noise from my children finds its
[SPEAKER_01]: way into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand you are likely dealing with
your own challenges and struggling with
[SPEAKER_01]: the uncertainty of when we're all going to
get back to business as usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we understand how those
factors play into purchasing a ticket for
[SPEAKER_01]: an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to put your mind at ease,
we want to let you know that if COVID-19
[SPEAKER_01]: forces us to reschedule, you will be
entitled to a 100% refund if the new dates
[SPEAKER_01]: don't work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: For more information about our COVID-19
refund policy, please check out our
[SPEAKER_01]: website at canmedevents.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, medicinal genomics and CanMed
events would like to do their part to
[SPEAKER_01]: support the community and organizations in
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 10% of any tickets sold before the
April 20th deadline will be donated to the
[SPEAKER_01]: CDC's Emergency Response Fund.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of now, CanMed 2020 is still on for
September 20th through 22nd, and we are
[SPEAKER_01]: working closely with the Pasadena
Convention Center to make sure we can
[SPEAKER_01]: bring you this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should anything change, we will be sure to
let you know on our website and through
[SPEAKER_01]: our email list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another great reason to sign up for email
alerts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we hope you stay safe and healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get to my conversation with
Kevin, we do have a sponsor for today's
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, PacBio.
[SPEAKER_01]: PacBio provides the tools to gain a
complete view of genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: For more information, go to PacB.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without any further ado, here's my
conversation with Kevin McKernan,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief Scientific Officer of Medicinal
Genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Kevin, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I figured it would be fitting to
have you as our first guest since you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been so heavily involved in CanMed since
its inception.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we should start with you kind of
telling the story about how CanMed came to
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, there's a long story there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually derived, I think, from a lot
of the parents that had children that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being treated in this kind of split
medical care system we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this was presented at CanMed last
year that only 9% of physicians are
[SPEAKER_00]: educated on the ECS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet we've got a lot of people that in
the cannabis space have been forced to
[SPEAKER_00]: practice medicine in circumstances where
they're either uncertified or don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to all the tools in the medical
care system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it creates a really challenging
environment for parents who are obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes having to use both systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the current Western medicine while
also seeking caregivers and other folks
[SPEAKER_00]: who are professionals in making some of
these oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of scientific apartheid
system that's occurred due to prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: has really created a need for physicians
to educate many people in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: field about the things we need to worry
about in treating a lot of these complex
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases at the same time for those
physicians to learn from people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis field that have been making these
products sort of under the table for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 80 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've always found that the division of
labor makes people hyper specialized and
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes the most productive
interactions are cross-disciplinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get together minds of people who
are doing growing and people who are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical chemistry, they're not always
speaking the same language of people doing
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics or people that are practicing
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting them all together to share
notes is extraordinarily important right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the spirit of CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like the conference really
started with a real medical focus given
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that medicinal genomics is still
part of cordogen at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the conference has really grown to
include more of those other disciplines
[SPEAKER_01]: like you had mentioned being cultivation
and laboratory testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's become a very important event for
the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the initial conferences were
definitely more medically written.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage everybody to go and look at
some of those presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have done a great job keeping
them all in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really early in the early days
to demonstrate the medical need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see a lot of patient
examples and stories that are brought out
[SPEAKER_00]: early on with some of the physicians
sharing their notes on how those
[SPEAKER_00]: progressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as it's grown, there's been an
interest in more money is coming to the
[SPEAKER_00]: space, more tool providers are more
comfortable working in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're seeing multinational
companies come in that are sponsoring the
[SPEAKER_00]: event to show off mass spec equipment or
the latest genomic tools or even some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the advances in the agricultural sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these are going to play a role
because the cost of the medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: we clearly want to come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition has clearly been elevating
that price for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only going to come down if we can
really drive yield and efficiency in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires a multidisciplinary
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so speaking of presentations,
I want to talk a bit about what I assume
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be presenting about at
CanMed 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we look back the last two
years, 2018, you kind of introduced this
[SPEAKER_01]: project to create a new reference genome
and talked about how it was funded through
[SPEAKER_01]: Dash and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 2019, we got another update about
sort of that project and how it was
[SPEAKER_01]: progressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you have a lot of new and
exciting information to share about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: About the research you've done to the
cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering if you could talk a bit
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of things have changed radically
in the sequencing space in the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really coincided with cannabis
becoming legal, which has been quite
[SPEAKER_00]: remarkable to see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are these new long read sequencers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they've been out for a while,
but they really the long read sequencers
[SPEAKER_00]: have really been hampered by their error
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not that accurate, but they can
get you very long reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we've never had before in
the sequencing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to add to that, just this year,
we saw PacBio finally get the single
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule sequencing to be more accurate
than Sanger data, which has really been
[SPEAKER_00]: the gold standard technique that we use to
initially sequence the human genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, plant genomes are even harder
than human genomes to sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more repetitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis genome is upwards to 70
percent repeat content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes even these long read tools trip
up on them unless they have the accuracy
[SPEAKER_00]: to separate all of the repeats that are in
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're closely related and similar
sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you really need accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And long reads to make that come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those came together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tools really have only been
available since this December.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did present on Jamaican Lion last
year, and those were done with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: more error prone tools that had very long
reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really pushed the genome forward
quite a bit in terms of completeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the centromeres and the
telomeres and the repetitive regions that
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of these cannabinoid synthase
genes are still somewhat quagmire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these longer read, more accurate tools
would be what they are calling the HiFi
[SPEAKER_00]: system at PacBio has begun to resolve
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to see full length
telomeres and cannabinoid synthase gene
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters all perfectly resolved with these
newer tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does change our perspective on
the genome and gives us a better tool to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare it to all the other cannabis
genomes out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all call it cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an active debate on how many
species there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you actually start looking at the
genomes across multiple different
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals, you realize one genome project
isn't going to solve this debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be in a world where we're
looking at multiple different references,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably initially a cannabinoid centric
reference genome set, where we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have type one references, type two
references, type three, fours and fives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we understand the genome from the
perspective of the various medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that they're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see some more data on how we've
used these long read tools to really
[SPEAKER_00]: resolve and close the chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: On genome completeness with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll also see some tools that are
now being developed as a result of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we have a confident understanding
of the order of all of these chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been building SNP chips with urofins
that can get us 90,000 SNPs out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome, mostly in coding regions that will
be more likely to be representative of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic changes or chemotypic changes
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these tools can now start to get
deployed at mass scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get involved with the DNA chips,
they're really effective to run hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: to thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people run 60,000 chip studies and
you can really begin to tease apart the
[SPEAKER_00]: markers that are predictive of yield
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a really exciting
change for the cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so was it that there was such
advancement in sequencing technology that
[SPEAKER_01]: you just really saw an opportunity to
improve upon the references that were out
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that really the driver?
[SPEAKER_00]: We initially got involved in this because
there were only type one female references
[SPEAKER_00]: being sequenced at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized we really needed to type
two plants, plants that made both CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted males sequenced as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Y chromosome is the largest
chromosome, and it probably has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: information in it to understand
hermaphroditism and other types of
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of growing hemp versus
growing drug type cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to get more completeness
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sequencing benefits were kind of an
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along the path of sequencing Jamaican
line, the companies that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily involved in this space for doing
de novo assembly began to realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is one of the hardest genomes
they've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've recently announced sequencing,
I think the Redwood and Sequoia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even those genomes which are bigger
genomes in cannabis, they're not nearly as
[SPEAKER_00]: repetitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're beginning to assemble into
better quality than the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabis genome has become a bit of
this trophy organism amongst the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who make DNA assembly tools, where they
all want to crack it because it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of the hardest ones to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has created a little bit of an
assemblathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where all the people who build the
DNA assembly tools are now working on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see Sergey Korin has been playing
around with us with this new assembler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang Lee at the Broad, who's another
famous person working in the DNA algorithm
[SPEAKER_00]: space, has got his new assembler.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been assembled with HiASM as the
name of his assembler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Falcon has been updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the assemblers now have
refactored and retooled and rewritten
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves to manage this new data
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a testament in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, Jamaican Lion is the only
cannabis plant that has these Hi-Fi reads
[SPEAKER_00]: run across it and put through five
different assemblers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really exciting time to see some
of these changes, because with this
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy means there are tools that we can
develop and are being developed that can
[SPEAKER_00]: do DNA assembly faster than we can map
Illumina reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a real change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've not had that in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an assembler called Peregrine
we encourage everyone to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the fastest thing we've
seen yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can assemble genomes now like on home
computers, which has never been the case
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't take any credit for that
advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of happens serendipitously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the timing is just perfect,
because we can deploy these things on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis genome and get the whole
community involved in trying to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: the reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who aren't maybe as familiar
with the intricacies of sequencing and
[SPEAKER_01]: assembling, what does all this work really
mean for the industry and where cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and cultivation can go with this
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the answer to that will probably
change over time and somewhat regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the current regulations at the USDA
have placed a deep emphasis on watching
[SPEAKER_00]: for residual THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's several sources theoretical
sources of residual THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see genomes now that have only CBD
synthase genes in them, and they still
[SPEAKER_00]: make residual THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually supported with a lot
of the cloning literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you clone CBD synthase into yeast and
feed it precursor, you'll still get some
[SPEAKER_00]: some THC made by that enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's about a 23 to 25 to one ratio
we tend to see of CBD synthase leaking
[SPEAKER_00]: some THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if your goal is to make CBD,
you can't really get rid of that other
[SPEAKER_00]: than to screen for plants that might have
variants in CBD synthase that alter that
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some activity with site
directing mutagenesis that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that may that may drive that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other cannabinoid synthase genes
in the genome that leak THC as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So none of these synthase genes are really
faithful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a little bit of side product
that that is usually made by a specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thought is still a theory,
but what our data seems to be pointing to
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know, a good number of the plants
out there have a deletion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabichromine synthase gene cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cluster that can have anywhere
between three to eight different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabichromine genes arrayed in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this in some type four
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type four plants have both THC and CBD
deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say THC synthase and CBD synthase
are both deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they shouldn't have any capacity to
make THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet we still see in these type four
plants, not just CBG being made,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also some residual THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, it's lower than what we see in
type three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still making some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that's coming from the
residual cannabichromine genes that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding the whole portfolio of
cannabinoid synthase genes is really the
[SPEAKER_00]: path to go if you want to get breeding for
seed lines that can consistently make you
[SPEAKER_00]: low amounts of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost it's very difficult to do
right now if you have a gene like CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase that is leaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow that above eight or nine
percent CBD synthase, you'll start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA pop up in those in those plants at a
level that may make it insufficient for
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average we're seeing over 40
different cannabinoid synthase genes to
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do DNA sequencing or when we
run these chips that we've built,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can begin to profile these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We alone have seen through sequencing over
200 and 22 variants inside CBD and THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthases point mutations in the genes
that might be altering its function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all now embedded on the urethane
chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will have tools coming out shortly
that will help readers scan for genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that have the highest likelihood of
producing the best ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's what's going to be
helpful for guiding maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, the major cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's an interest in figuring out
what's making the minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What might be making THC or CBDP?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the the the longer side chain
molecules that were discovered in Italy
[SPEAKER_00]: that are 30 times more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what makes those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think it's related to the
synthase genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's related to the genes
upstream in the cannabinoid synthase
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genetics may help lead the way in
predicting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very recently, a cannabinovone was
described, discovered in hemp 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they're beginning to tease it
apart and realize that it is, in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to understand what are the
other synthase genes that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also getting some potential now to
to predict terpene expression based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene synthase genes that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hopeful we'll be able to get
more focus on the can flavin gene set as
[SPEAKER_00]: well by doing more sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The can flavins are showing a lot of
promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I saw some work in pancreatic
cancer and prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are flavonoids that are often not
tested for in the analytical chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs and can meds a great area to bring
some of those papers forward, talk to the
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical chemists to see if there are
standards and if there are ways to detect
[SPEAKER_00]: them and get the extraction folks involved
to know what's the best way to capture
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be captured in oil extracts
as efficiently as other extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that that type of intersection with
what the what the medical field is seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: from a cannabinoid standpoint,
how to analytically detect them properly
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field and likewise, how to
potentially grow for them and breed for
[SPEAKER_00]: them are all interdisciplinary tools that
in discussions we need to be having with
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple different people and can meds the
right place for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really seems like figuring out the
cannabinoids, the flavonoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: is really the first step with with
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, that's one that's one
section of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're hinting at a really
important point here, which is yield may
[SPEAKER_00]: also be related to trichome genes or to
pathogen resistance, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that pathogens can severely limit
a crop upwards to 40 percent lower yield
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have some of these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understanding the pathogen resistance
in the plants is likely going to bring us
[SPEAKER_00]: higher yield as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the paper we published back in January
listed over 80 different pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were mostly thomatine like proteins
and chitinases and another loci known as
[SPEAKER_00]: MLO, which has been studied heavily in
hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we can better understand those
genetics, we can breed for plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew resistance and perhaps have
less aspergillus that might be present in
[SPEAKER_00]: them as well, just by keeping an eye on
the portfolio of pathogen resistance genes
[SPEAKER_00]: they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the genes involved in this
pathogen response are actually closely
[SPEAKER_00]: located next to the cannabichromine gene,
such that when the plants are deleted in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabichromine, they may pull out five
other genes for the ride in that deletion
[SPEAKER_00]: and make those plants more susceptible to
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not been proven yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just happen to know those genes are
frequently deleted concurrently with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabichromine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people are selecting for lines that
don't have that to try and meet the USDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got to keep a close eye on on the
pathogen response to those plants so they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't end up having hemp plants that are
compliant with the USDA but are loaded
[SPEAKER_00]: with mold and mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to know the hemp market is
not screening for mold and mildew the way
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical market is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a bit of an exposure point for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever you talk about genetics and
kind of genes and everything, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people will start going to GMO or maybe
even CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you foresee a potential that those
types of technologies will be used in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: They already are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no stopping that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people find that to be
controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think one thing you will learn from
looking at these cannabis genomes and just
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing them is the plant is a far
better genomic engineer than we are at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is shuffling stuff around at a really
high rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're seeing structural variations
between these genomes that may include
[SPEAKER_00]: about an eighth of the genetic content in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tremendous amount of variation
that can be occurring just between any two
[SPEAKER_00]: given plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are going to make some
modifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks are going to be very afraid of
that, but they may not fully appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that this plant is doing that on
its own quite frequently and probably more
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligently than we are at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there have been cases of people
trying to delete THC synthase with CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure, it's a great plan, but we
already have naturally deleted THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthases in the population, and that
doesn't give us 0% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some other genes you need to
delete as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe another 39 cannabinoid synthase
genes that are leaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hemp transformation protocols are
really early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that you can do multiple
site mutagenesis with CRISPR and select
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's early for those types of studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what you're more likely to see is
rapid breeding, is finding the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles you want in the field and
intelligently breeding some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics out of the plant and into
the set of cultures you're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting CRISPR to transform plants and
get those to be stably represented and not
[SPEAKER_00]: to be mosaics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, when you do these genetic
modifications, it's very difficult to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them to transform every single cell in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to start with a very small amount
of tissue and hope that you get 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: transfection efficiency, and then find a
selectable marker that brings that out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the tissue type.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that limits what you can do in many
respects right now with the current CRISPR
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think they're coming,
and I do think they're going to play a
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable role.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of the most exciting genetic
engineering stuff that we're seeing is the
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity to bring some of these genes into
other hosts like yeast so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: really torture test them as an individual
gene in a different organism to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work that we saw presented last
year with Demetrix, interesting enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were able to clone THC and CBD
synthase into a yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by feeding it different precursors
from hexanoic acid to octanoic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were able to get the yeast to make
THCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That taught us a lot about THCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That taught us that THC synthase can,
in fact, make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's probably not where to
genetically learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for any of the mutations in the plant
that are making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also gave us a model to know that
when you isolate this single gene and feed
[SPEAKER_00]: it particular precursors, you get a
desired outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that teaches us a lot about the
biochemistry and the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes, these tools of shuttling
genes around teach us a lot about the
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity of the plant so that we don't
have to do as much guesswork in the
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering we want to do in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you foresee a future where folks are
creating cannabinoids with yeast instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the benefits of the
yeast-derived cannabinoids are that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be highly pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make them and make preferably only
one or two of them, depending on how much
[SPEAKER_00]: side product you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about yeast is you can control
the conditions you grow it in and perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: coax those enzymes to be less promiscuous
in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can also put different
molecules on them if you want to tag the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids so that you can purify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kiesing paper put a biotin on the
tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are ways to put biotins on
molecules where it's removable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may be edging into a really highly
purified form of one particular
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid, which can be a little bit
difficult to iron out in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll make for a great GMP grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't yet know if it's going to be
competitive economically with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start getting more efficient
breeding going on, the plant may in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: be a very productive way of making this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those economic things are best seen in
the marketplace, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's going to be necessarily
an instant replacement for all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds we want to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is because we're feeding
yeast sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% of the sugar in the world is made by
chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's likely that this is a great tool
to simplify what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it may not necessarily be the most
carbon efficient way to grow other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of an open field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, if we could get THCP expressed
in the plant up to 20%, that might make it
[SPEAKER_00]: more productive to make in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't know that THC or THCP is
ever going to be grown outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning it may remain artificially
elevated in price such that yeast has an
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if people who are doing this
in yeast are going to target CBD first.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is something you can grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those economics are going to probably
plummet a lot faster than indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I view right now it as a very helpful
tool for us dissecting the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may, in fact, turn out to be a very
productive purification tool, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we are consistently being
reminded by these whole plant extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: being more productive than isolated
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be a theme that's been in
the cannabinoid space for 20 or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing the best we can to profile
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the complexity of the expression of
these plant-derived cocktails is it may
[SPEAKER_00]: just be people need to get those plants
cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great story of Avadeco,
which is a plant that was sequenced and
[SPEAKER_00]: put on canapede.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Tikamolam owns this particular
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they went down the road of getting a
plant patent and cloning that and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that that plant they could stably
express the same extract from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they have that approved for autism
in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a label that's really specific
to a plant that's dialed in at making a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I see that model kind of emerging
as people find certain plants that work
[SPEAKER_00]: for certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be faster to clone that and
protect that plant and make the extract
[SPEAKER_00]: that way than to figure out the
complicated networks inside of yeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to make yeast mimic the exact recipe
that the plant's making for that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of see a couple different things
emerging, but I don't really have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: crystal ball on which one's going to be
most affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting you said that that
was going to be my follow up question is,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we were to move towards having yeast
create these single compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: what does that mean for the whole extract
community?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that there's a healthy
debate between the two of whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: the future of cannabis medicine is the
single compounds or whether or not it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I imagine that'll be a source of
debate and conversation that will
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly be taking place at CanMed this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's maybe people are starting to
see that it's a bit of a false dichotomy
[SPEAKER_00]: to think it's going to be either or the
likely answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to depend on certain niche
conditions in each of those those
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, the FDA route is more tuned for
single compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have seen the story before in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we isolate a single compound,
the efficacy seems to go down and we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the it makes for for cleaner science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes for cleaner studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes for a more comfortable FDA
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those who are looking at this as a
wellness product or something that is OTC
[SPEAKER_00]: and less FDA involvement, we may have the
freedom to actually fine tune these
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think these whole plant extracts
really do need a lot more and a little
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry done than what we're currently
doing on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are monitoring maybe a dozen
cannabinoids and a dozen terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we really are not paying any attention
to the flavonoids and and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other compounds that that could be in this
plant that are playing a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that I think we
definitely need to up our game on if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to continue to push for this whole
plant extract approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that you've said so
much during this conversation is it's
[SPEAKER_01]: early and we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to imagine that's got to be one
of the reasons why you decide to put the
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaican lion information and so much of
the information that you put together
[SPEAKER_01]: public so that you can almost crowdsource
this information and kind of accelerate
[SPEAKER_01]: our understanding of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's I've been through this story
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when we sequence the human
genome, it is one of these scenarios where
[SPEAKER_00]: it unleashes so much information into into
the world that no single company can
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly comprehend it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're actually held back by trying
to to hoard the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more eyeballs that look at it,
the more other things are discovered and
[SPEAKER_00]: advances.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all we all build upon each other's
knowledge base here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge is cumulative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting data public is has been
extraordinarily helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already seen multiple people publish
off of the Jamaican lion reference before
[SPEAKER_00]: we did, because they were at a stage in
research where we were the last piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: the puzzle in their research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It filled it out and they were able to
publish some really meaningful results.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we were still trying to get the
publications ready for for peer review on
[SPEAKER_00]: an entire genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important the data is out
there public because this allows it to
[SPEAKER_00]: float all boats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it's your competitors boat,
it's going to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be hard to see at first,
but it it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a few of those publications out
there you can look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a proteomic map by Ben Osborne's
lab that was that was published.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some work from Keith Allen on the
turpian synthase genes in Jamaican lion
[SPEAKER_00]: that was published.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a recent review article with
Nolan Cain's lab that was reviewing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the genomes that has looked at Jamaican
lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will caution folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are three different main
publications we have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the earliest work we put out
instantly on October 1st in 2018 on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are some of the more I'd say the
earlier draft genomes that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This recent publication in January of 2020
has some updated sequencing on it that
[SPEAKER_00]: has, I think, an improved the continuity
of the assembly about fivefold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's better annotated now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the annotations of all the genes
because we did RNA sequencing on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want any of the bleeding edge
stuff that's going on, the assemblathon is
[SPEAKER_00]: all public.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are unannotated references,
but they're the highest contiguity
[SPEAKER_00]: references that have ever been generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see full length telomeres on these
things, which is really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never been able to see those before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where the folks who
want to play with the latest and greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: are jumping on the the assemblathon data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you've touched on it
throughout the conversation, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: wondering if you might be able to kind of
summarize what does all this work really
[SPEAKER_01]: mean for health care providers or cannabis
patients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why should they be excited about all this
work being done in genomics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we're going to get it's
going to solve some of the nomenclature
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many patients will know that this strain
works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to have the same THC level as the
next one, but that one gives me a headache
[SPEAKER_00]: or have some other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other adverse, I get sleepy,
some other adverse effects happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then when they move state to state,
they can't necessarily rely on that same
[SPEAKER_00]: strain name to get them the same response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once we start getting genetic
signatures across all these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will begin to change the nomenclature
from being, you know, this is a sativa or
[SPEAKER_00]: an indica and this one's going to give you
couch lock and this one's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those those are all associations
on taxonomy that doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really need a genetic taxonomy
system so we know and we can solve this
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of strain specific whole extract
market, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I think it's going to do
is it is going to enable people to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome and do different things and
think, OK, we have problems with too many
[SPEAKER_00]: males in open fields and the feminization
process we're afraid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you solve that problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might want to put markers in
the white chromosome so they can easily
[SPEAKER_00]: detect males and remove them more easily
than doing perhaps genetic tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: One concept people have been throwing
around is putting a green fluorescent
[SPEAKER_00]: protein on the Y so they can run drones
over fields and image them for the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be expressing in a certain
wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy idea, but it would probably work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's economical,
but there's ideas like that that weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: generated in our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just ideas that have emerged in
the community ever since there's now we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a white chromosome and we know what
to target.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see the same thing
in modulating some of the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: modulating some of the other compounds in
the plant that are lowly expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the cannabinoid synthase genes we
believe have been bred into near
[SPEAKER_00]: extinction because we had one biomarker we
could test for, and that was THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: People could smoke cannabis and know that
we were breeding in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we now know that the biochemistry
involved in the plant means the expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of one cannabinoid is a bit of a zero sum
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: The precursors are all competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you breed from one
cannabinoid, you lose the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prohibition is probably bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these rare cannabinoids into near
extinction and we need to rescue them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genomics is going to lead to a map
on how to rescue those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where we'll see some of
the most exciting work in the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's really interesting you touched
on that because I had kind of been
[SPEAKER_01]: wondering that myself is that,
you know, is there a future where some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these minor cannabinoids actually become
major cannabinoids in plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important while we're
doing that breeding, we take a whole list
[SPEAKER_00]: of pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at all of these other pathogen
response genes to make sure we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrificing yield or pathogen exposure to
grab one of these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're we're actively in the space of
monitoring the microbiome of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make a lot of the testing kits out
there that look for aspergillus,
[SPEAKER_00]: E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli and salmonella and powdery mildew and
a variety of these of these common
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes that are in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think this is a really important
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need to understand the
microbiome of the plants in order to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure we can produce the right amount of of
compound with the least amount of patient
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't really grow these plants
like a boy in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how they operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really do need symbiotic
relationships with other microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have to be microbes that aren't
pathogens to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that process, I think, is going to
be more than just genomic driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be microbiome and genomic
driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need both tools to really,
I think, skin that cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Kevin, we're coming up to the
end here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always fascinating talking to you
about these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people want to learn more, what are the
best ways to to learn more about what
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been talking about today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of the Jamaican line
data is an NCBI NCBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a high friction to get data in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always probably three to six
months behind what you can find in our
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our website has the assembly thought on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the data links to a lot of
the data there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn more, if you can't
find an NCBI, make sure to contact us or
[SPEAKER_00]: come through a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get you early access that data
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also keep an eye on the Koji genome
browser that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of tutorials online
teaching people how to play around with
[SPEAKER_00]: that Koji genome browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has now it has forty seven whole
genome shotgun samples that are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's that's got hemp lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got type four lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has hermaphroditic lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got THCV lines in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has just a wide array of different
cannabis plants that are now whole genome
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence in public for everybody to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also has a trio of Jamaican lion
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a male and a female and an
offspring that have all been de novo
[SPEAKER_00]: assembled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really good resource to take
your sequencing data made from any
[SPEAKER_00]: platform and thread it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you sequence somewhere else,
you can find ways to take that data and
[SPEAKER_00]: align it against the Jamaican lion
references so that you can compare it to
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this RNA data and whole genome
shotgun data from other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's becoming a really nicely and
heavily used tool so people can search
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then likewise, other we've got a lot
of content on our on our Facebook page and
[SPEAKER_00]: on our website regarding one of the
pathogen work that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are having some great success cloning
enzymes out of the plant that we believe
[SPEAKER_00]: are responsible for some of the resistance
of these molds and expressing them in
[SPEAKER_00]: other organisms like E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli so that we can make cannabis proteins
that we know fight off fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that may turn into a really
interesting direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of a green chemistry for
pesticides that don't generate small
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules that enrich an extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to go enzymatic here so we can
make natural cannabis peptides that
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy or attack fungi and do not enrich
or cause any risk in the extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: process and contaminating oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a whole new kind of green
chemistry field that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any closing remarks about CanMed
specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be a banner year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of nervousness over the
covid crisis that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still planning CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been paying close attention to that
pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we've even built ourselves
our own little covid test here for
[SPEAKER_00]: employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not taking it lightly,
but we do sense there's optimism in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air and that this will pass and that some
of the compounds that are coming to play
[SPEAKER_00]: here are showing some promise in that the
testing rates that we're seeing lead to a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of optimism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a high number of patients out
there that don't have this or the antibody
[SPEAKER_00]: tests are beginning to show have some
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't think this is going to stall
CanMed or delay it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually think that we're going to be
around this corner by summertime and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the conferences will then subsume and
we'll need them by then because so many
[SPEAKER_00]: have since been canceled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep the date open for CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's still going to go live and
we think it's going to be a banner year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great way to close it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope you enjoyed my conversation
with Kevin.

[SPEAKER_01]: Rousseau.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Rousseau is a board certified
neurologist specializing in child
[SPEAKER_01]: neurology.
[SPEAKER_01]: His interest in medicinal plants led him
to incorporate cannabis into his practice
[SPEAKER_01]: and his research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, he has authored several books
and articles about the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are so excited to have him as a
keynote presenter at CanMed 2020.
