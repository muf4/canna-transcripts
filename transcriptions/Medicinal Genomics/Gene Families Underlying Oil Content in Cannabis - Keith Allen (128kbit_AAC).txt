[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, hello I am Keith Allen from Front
Range Biosciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about something that's a
little bit different from what was in my
[SPEAKER_00]: abstract, but you know time moves on and
sometimes science moves on with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to talk about is gene
families underlying oil content in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, specifically the cannabinoid
synthase family and the terpene synthase
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about just a little bit
of stuff with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objectives of this talk,
we've been doing a bunch of work in both
[SPEAKER_00]: of these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to share some recent results on
the structure, the expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the evolution of the cannabinoid
synthase family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put this into the context of
the larger berberine bridge enzyme family
[SPEAKER_00]: and take a quick peek at variation in the
terpene synthase family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start with a paper that came
out last year, Origin and Evolution of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid Oxidocyclase Gene Family,
an excellent paper by Van Veltsen and
[SPEAKER_00]: Schranz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabinoid oxidocyclase gene
family is the berberine bridge enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are oxidocyclases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolutionarily it's a very old family that
makes a variety of plant secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites that tend to be in the 2025
carbon range or about the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did in this paper that is so
useful, I think, is they took advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that we now have complete genomes
for cannabis, humulis, tremma,
[SPEAKER_00]: and perisponia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which together are the cannabaceae clade,
depending on how you define it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for the origins of
the cannabinoid synthases, it's reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: to ask, did the expansion of this family
happen in cannabis itself, or did it
[SPEAKER_00]: happen earlier perhaps in humulis,
maybe in perisponia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tremma or perisponia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the authors did is they looked for
syntanic relationships and they were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to find in humulis and in the other two
species, they were able to find the region
[SPEAKER_00]: of the genome that gave rise to the
cannabinoid synthase pathway and follow
[SPEAKER_00]: this through with the syntanic
relationships and then see basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: so what happened here was cannabis
inherited, well this big berberine bridge
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme family, but there was one gene in
particular that ended up going through a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of duplications in order,
they originally gave a founder set of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid synthases and then there were
subsequent duplications that produced the
[SPEAKER_00]: family structure that we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the really interesting finding of this
paper is that the cannabinoid synthases
[SPEAKER_00]: did evolve within the species cannabis
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of an interesting thing in
and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the berberine bridge enzyme
family in cannabis, so this is doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I did here was gene discovery,
on CS10 genome, the reference genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what I'm doing here is the genes that
already have a name that are published in
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature, so THC, CBD synthase,
the CBC synthases, they get a name,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else gets a number, and that
number is the percent identity to the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've used expression data libraries
that were published in the break at all
[SPEAKER_00]: paper on the Cambio2 genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice set of libraries because
they have trichome, flower libraries,
[SPEAKER_00]: then female leaf, male leaf, and root,
so you can do a little bit of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: specificity kinds of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm running here, the Cambio2
expression data, this is from a type 2
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, so you've got more or less equal
expression of THC and CBD synthases,
[SPEAKER_00]: very little expression of the rest of the
cannabinoid genes, but you look across the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of this, of the berberine bridge
enzyme, and Cambio2 is a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_00]: outlier because you have stronger
expression in trichomes of some of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly this one at 43.503,
but pretty much across the board,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see pretty healthy levels of
expression of these completely
[SPEAKER_00]: uncharacterized berberine bridge enzymes
in trichomes, but also elsewhere in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you see big differences between
female leaf and male leaf, and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: that most of these berberine bridge
enzymes are expressed in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are secondary plant metabolites,
which are primarily about communicating
[SPEAKER_00]: with the environment in one way or
another, so it's interesting to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing in roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this one down here,
88.398, it has pretty healthy expression
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis trichomes, I don't see much of
anything anyplace else, it turns out this
[SPEAKER_00]: gene is about 85% identical to CBDAS,
88% identical to THCAS, it's not full
[SPEAKER_00]: length, it's missing the start codon part
of the secretion signal, it doesn't go all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to the stop codon, and it has
several stop mutations in it, stop codons
[SPEAKER_00]: in it, it cannot make a functional
protein, it's a pseudogene, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: highly expressed, well, or at least has
fairly reasonable amounts of expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that topic of expression here,
I'm looking, using the expression data
[SPEAKER_00]: published by Zager et al, so this is nine
different trichome libraries, only one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these, Kanetsu here, is a type two,
and you see expressions split between THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBD synthase, but basically the two
big guys, which we never see these present
[SPEAKER_00]: in more than one copy, but they tend to
have, I mean to really dominate expression
[SPEAKER_00]: overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also see that this pseudogene,
there's always a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: expression on this thing, and in some
strains, it actually can be quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what this thing is doing,
but pseudogenes, expressed pseudogenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently play regulatory roles,
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that will have to be
looked at more to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just throw this out as something that I
found along the way that could be playing
[SPEAKER_00]: an interesting role here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know at this point what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in thinking about the evolution of the
cannabinoid synthases from tremahumulus
[SPEAKER_00]: and persponia sequences, what I've done
here is I've done an alignment of just the
[SPEAKER_00]: active site residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is determined from the crystal
structure, and this is things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: close enough that they can be interacting
with either the FAD molecule that is
[SPEAKER_00]: covalently linked into the active site of
these enzymes, or with the substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of the cannabinoid synthases,
that's CBGA, or the varine equivalent of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking across the active site,
there's a bunch of things that are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: well conserved, like 100% conserved,
and 50% of the residues in this alignment
[SPEAKER_00]: are 100% conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these, so HIS114, CIS176 here,
and here, these guys are covalently linked
[SPEAKER_00]: to the FAD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 100% conserved all the way out to
tremah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the others here, this tyrosine
417, they propose is, and this is from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sheyama et al, this is the crystal
structure paper, they propose that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in hydrogen bonding, and HIS292
is also involved in hydrogen bonding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of your CBGA substrate here, HIS292,
well, you know, it's replaced by an
[SPEAKER_00]: arginine in the out species.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could play the same hydrogen bonding
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tyrosine 417 is a tyrosine in humulus and
goes to a phenylalanine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that could be doing a pi-bonding
role, but it couldn't be doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen bonding role.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are probably, well, it's hard to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say what the specificity of
an enzyme is gonna be just by looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the active site, but that's kind of an
important difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing, tyrosine 484
here, this is the catalytic base that rips
[SPEAKER_00]: off a proton and starts the reaction that
leads you to your final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tyrosine 484 right here is conserved all
the way out to tremah and parasponium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to take this a little bit further,
now looking at both of these plots,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna take a little explaining here,
but looking at how the cannabis genes
[SPEAKER_00]: compare to tremah parasponium,
what I did here is I took all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis genes, and this is the entire
Berberine-Bridge family here, and I
[SPEAKER_00]: compared them to tremah, and I says what
is the percent identity of the top hit in
[SPEAKER_00]: tremah, and that's on this axis here is
similarity to tremah, and then I also
[SPEAKER_00]: compared all of them to THC synthase,
and this is again percent identity to THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy out here at 100%, that is THC
synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, that's the CBD synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the clade C genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back up a step, because I've forgotten to
tell you a part.
[SPEAKER_00]: In thinking about the this paper,
the other thing that the Van Velsen paper
[SPEAKER_00]: did is they came up with a nomenclature
for talking about the entire clade
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically THC and CBD constitute their
own clades.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBC synthase group constitutes its own
clade, and then these guys at 88% that
[SPEAKER_00]: gets called clade C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to call them the 88s, but clade C
is a better name for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is clade C.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the CBC synthases, and they're
all at around 58% identical to their top
[SPEAKER_00]: hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of these at 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see here is that basically the
more you look like THC synthase,
[SPEAKER_00]: the less you look like anything from
perisponia or trauma or humulus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of these genes that are down in
the 45% identity to THC, these are really
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar to their counterparts in the
out species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of drives home a little bit
more the part where the evolution of this
[SPEAKER_00]: family really happened in cannabis,
in the cannabis species, and so that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys are going completely off on
their own and are getting further and
[SPEAKER_00]: further away from the genes that they
originally evolved from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step in this is looking at the
kinds of changes that have happened going
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not showing you the complete
alignment, but basically taking this set
[SPEAKER_00]: of sequences and now aligning the full
sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things are in the range of 545 amino
acids long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all pretty much the same length,
so an alignment of all of these is a nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: well-behaved thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went through this, and I looked every
time in the alignment there was a change,
[SPEAKER_00]: say A to S, A to phenylalanine,
A to leucine, any of those changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did was I kept track, I wrote some
code to use a substitution matrix,
[SPEAKER_00]: the BLOSMP62 substitution matrix,
to assign a severity score.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically how big of a change was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: BLOSMP62, if you run a BLAST search at
NCBI, by default BLOSMP62 for a protein
[SPEAKER_00]: search, that's the substitution matrix
that gets used, and basically what
[SPEAKER_00]: BLOSMP62 does is it tells you,
I mean exactly what I'm looking for there,
[SPEAKER_00]: how serious of a change has taken place
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we just look at random, you just
basically take the whole matrix and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do all the changes look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, a score of zero means you don't
lose any points in your alignment,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't hurt you, but most of the time
you get a negative score.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just at random change an amino
acid, usually it's going to hurt you in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of similarity to the original
protein and conservation of the function
[SPEAKER_00]: of that protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some of these scores,
you know, you can get a positive score for
[SPEAKER_00]: a mismatch leucine to isoleucine,
for example, but usually it hurts you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the berberine bridge enzyme
family, including the out species,
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking at all the changes that
happen, there is a substantial shift
[SPEAKER_00]: toward more positive scores that happens
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, doing Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,
it's the standard test to compare two
[SPEAKER_00]: distributions like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a p-value on this, you know,
two to the minus 16th, which tells me that
[SPEAKER_00]: these are definitely different
distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this tells us is that the evolution
of the family happening in cannabis took
[SPEAKER_00]: place under selective pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way you can get a
departure from random like what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing here is if there has been some kind
of pressure on this to push it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've suspected this for a long time,
but it's nice to have it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think, I think this is almost the
last thing I'm going to tell you about the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in and I looked at the promoter
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the MemeSuite to go in and then I
used a database of Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor binding sites that
has been experimentally determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used the Arabidopsis database and
went in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a two-step process to map binding
sites within the promoter motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a ton of binding sites and I
assumed that a lot of those are false
[SPEAKER_00]: positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second step is to go in and ask
for which binding sites occur more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently than you would expect at
random.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm showing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing you examples of the THC
synthases from the start codon here at
[SPEAKER_00]: zero to minus a thousand, thousand bases
upstream, and I'm showing it to you from
[SPEAKER_00]: three different genomes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all the THC synthases look very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the CBD synthases look very similar,
but they look different from the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the same thing with the CBC
synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some differences that you'll
see, but it's a different picture than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for the clade C.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't tell us a lot directly about
exactly how are these guys regulated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does tell us that these guys are
going to respond differently to the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory environment because they've got
different sets of binding sites in their
[SPEAKER_00]: promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, speaking of that regulatory
environment, I just went in and I pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: out a bunch of cannabis transcription
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is by similarity to a set of
Arabidopsis transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've now used both the Zager trichome
libraries and another set of five
[SPEAKER_00]: libraries from Judith Booth and a little
bit more recent paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking across 14 different trichome
mRNA datasets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then each of these genes, I'm just giving
it the name of the top blast hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually know that much about what
these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the variation that's
happening here, basically, it doesn't look
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's that much consistency going
on, but you need to remember that RNA-seq
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of a blunt instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, anything less than about
four-fold is not really a statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these vary by less than about
five-fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, for most of these transcription
factors, you've got a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency in how much of it,
what is the expression level of this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, saying that most of them are
consistent, there's a substantial set of
[SPEAKER_00]: these, about a third of them, where the
differences that you see between different
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome libraries is between one and
three orders of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these are from all the way off to
on at a pretty good level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the differences that we see
between different trichomes in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotype, it can be traced straight
back to the transcriptional regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to switch over now to the
terpene synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a slide I've been using for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I think it worked out to be 778
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I was at Steep Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were testing labs, so this is mostly
recreational cannabis samples coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: the front door for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a terpene profile done on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes are ranked here by total
amount, mercine, karyophylline,
[SPEAKER_00]: limonene, pionene, being the most abundant
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the interesting things about this
is, for mercine, the number of enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: that make mercine, it's hard to get a zero
mercine plant, but you do get some that
[SPEAKER_00]: have not got very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of interesting, but you look
down here at turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: When turpinoline is on, it tends to be
really on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When turpinoline is on, it tends to be the
dominant terpene in that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a lot of the time,
there's a lot of these where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: little bits, and there's a number of these
where there's none.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it turns out, there's two enzymes
that we know about so far that make
[SPEAKER_00]: turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them makes it as a side product,
and it's not a lot, and the other one,
[SPEAKER_00]: TPS 37, makes turpinoline as its major
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the interest of time, I'm going to keep
going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at turbinosynthase expression,
again, this is going across the same 14
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see large changes in the amount of
expression, but you look at some of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: like TPS 20, it can go from very strong to
zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's going on with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is close to my last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did, we began to suspect that there
was substantial presence-absence variation
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in this family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was I pulled together six
different genome assemblies, and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: did a gene discovery run using genome
threader and exonerate, and then as my
[SPEAKER_00]: bait, I used the complete set of known THC
or turpinosynthase genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of gene discovery, the more
similar your bait gene is to what's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome, the higher the probability is that
you're going to pull out what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really shooting fish in a
barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the gene is present in the genome,
I'm going to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking first at the tree here,
so this works out to be about 46 genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's hard to say exactly how many
turbinosynthase genes there are in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, because every line you pick up
has a different number, and then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these genes that, you know,
they're not the same in each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to ask, you know, five SNPs,
it's probably the same gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 SNPs, is it the same gene or is it not?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the structure of this
family, you've got your clade B here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your monoturbinosynthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, clade A, these are
sesquiterpene synthases, and then clade G,
[SPEAKER_00]: these can make a mixture of either,
and then the little dots here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark dot means that I was able to find
a chloroplast import signal on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the yellow dots means there was one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the sesquiterpene synthases stay in
the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monoterpene synthases go into the
plastid, which is where GPP is made,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the precursor for the monoterpene
synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running out of time here, but basically
what I found is that, so this is a heat
[SPEAKER_00]: map that is not expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the number of genes that I found
within a 95% identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light green means I found one.
[SPEAKER_00]: White means I found zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medium green means I found two,
and then dark green is three or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and they're not necessarily identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these, like TPS9 over here in
Jamaican Lion, there are two copies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are almost completely identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these that's like, you know,
96% identical to each other, but there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a tremendous amount of presence-absence
variation going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: TPS37 was not present in any of the
genomes that I looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now, we've gone past this,
and we've determined, using PCR
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches, that TPS37 has strong
presence-absence behavior, and the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants don't have terpenaline is
because they lack the gene completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I need to move on pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the cannabinoids are not specific to
cannabis, the gene family responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: their production in cannabis seems to be a
specific innovation of this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC and CBD synthases don't appear to
ever be present in more than one copy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the other two clades, CBC synthase and
clade C groups, are quite variable in copy
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each clade within the cannabinoid family
has its own motor structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evolution of the cannabinoid clade
occurred under strong selection pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there is substantial presence-absence
variation in the terpene synthase family,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this, along with the expression,
is probably adequate to explain the range
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypes that we see, and then in
particular, the on-off behavior of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenaline seems to result from the
presence or absence of TPS37, and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
