[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Elizabeth Thompson.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a bachelor's in molecular biology and
a master's in physiology, Liz has studied
[SPEAKER_00]: the human body through many lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The focus of her PhD program in pharmacy
is to explore disorders that have directly
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted her life in the world of
professional contact sports and how
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid products could potentially
play a role in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a member of the clinical trial team
that was recently awarded funding from the
[SPEAKER_00]: NFL to study cannabinoids in concussion
and pain, she is excited to bring new data
[SPEAKER_00]: to the literature, exploring cannabinoids
and athletics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liz and her team recently published an
extensive literature review titled,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid Therapy in Athletics,
a review of current cannabis research to
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluate potential real-world cannabinoid
applications in sport, which establishes a
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation for their future research.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discussed how
Liz became interested in the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of cannabinoids, the published
literature that supports using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids for neuroinflammation and
neurodegenerative disorders, her team's
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with the NFL in ongoing
clinical trials focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroinflammation and recovery in
athletes, particularly after concussions,
[SPEAKER_00]: the current use of cannabis in athletics
and how sports organizations are changing
[SPEAKER_00]: their policies, future directions of
research, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with Liz,
I'd like to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dent Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: With more than 300,000 patient visits per
year, the Dent Neurologic Institute ranks
[SPEAKER_00]: among the largest neuroscience centers in
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its 24 subspecialty clinics often treat
the most challenging neurologic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, including, but not limited to,
migraine, chronic pain, ALS, MS,
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's, dementia, neuro-oncology,
and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: With their mission of advancing
neuroscience, they established a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: clinic in 2016 to aid in the treatment of
these chronic conditions seen throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: their institute.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without any further ado, please enjoy my
conversation with Liz Thompson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Liz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of your podcast,
so I'm honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm excited to talk with you today
about the work that you and your team are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing to better understand the therapeutic
potential of cannabinoids in athletics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a good place to start is why
don't you tell us how you got involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: researching cannabinoids in athletics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was not a linear path, as I don't
think anybody's ever really is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my undergraduate degree is in
molecular biology, and then I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: master's degree in applied physiology,
and I was always athletic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with my physiology degree,
we were always looking at training
[SPEAKER_01]: principles or just basically principles of
physiology of how can you really push the
[SPEAKER_01]: human body to do things that you want it
to do, essentially using
[SPEAKER_01]: non-pharmacological agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at training principles or
nutrition or even supplementation,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked with athletes and I also
worked clinically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a patient population,
but the biggest driving factor behind it
[SPEAKER_01]: was my cousins actually was a professional
athlete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been together since we were 17
years old, and I would watch him play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, this is not going to
end well if you keep on the head contact
[SPEAKER_01]: and the contact and the contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just knowing, having a background
really of molecular mechanisms and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding what was happening all the
time, I started to really look for ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce the neural inflammation,
just thinking like, I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding you with a straw when we're 80
years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of things you can do,
which is the empowering part about
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding physiology is there's a ton
that you can do to really help support
[SPEAKER_01]: your system to reduce those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started looking specifically,
so when he was playing really was in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000s, so I'll date myself here,
but it was really the height of the opioid
[SPEAKER_01]: epidemics in athletics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was a lot of exposure of
opioids and we had teammates that ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: with opioid problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We buried some teammates and I was like,
you know, there has to be something better
[SPEAKER_01]: than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to understand that,
I wanted to understand the mechanisms of
[SPEAKER_01]: how opioids worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started to look at the molecular
mechanisms in the brain of how opioids
[SPEAKER_01]: were actually working and physiologically,
like why are people, how does it kill you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is happening here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I came across research that
suggested that using cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could actually reduce the required
amount of opioids to have the same pain
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was thinking like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would that even work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really know anything about
cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I was a downhill ski
racer and I played rugby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always like, you know, an endorphin
junkie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we understood cannabis from like a
recreational cultural standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always around, but I didn't really
understand anything about the molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanisms, which was shocking because I'd
already finished two degrees that were
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on molecular mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had never seen anything about these
in the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, I started looking at that and
I kind of went down a rabbit hole and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have been there for probably the last 10
or 15 years, just looking at the different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways that the endocannabinoid system can
work really in neuroinflammation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it really goes everywhere throughout
your whole body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was looking at things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I applied to, you know,
I thought, okay, well, I think that I saw
[SPEAKER_01]: the mechanism that I really wanted to look
at and it was the calcium channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just getting like super nerdy here,
but it was the calcium channels in the
[SPEAKER_01]: neurons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, well, like who's looking at
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I looked for any supervisor
anywhere that was actually studying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, after having a couple of
people tell you, you're totally crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's like, Hey, have you ever
looked at using cannabis to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: neuroinflammation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people are like, yeah,
okay, next.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're talking about,
but my supervisor now, he was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: first people, it was like the only paper
that I actually found at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was published specifically talking
about some of the cytokines and chemokines
[SPEAKER_01]: that happen, you know, when you have
neuroinflammation and the potential for
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some things that cannabinoids could
do to reduce those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I contacted him and he knew exactly
what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like so thrilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought I was going to have to
beg him to take me on as a graduate
[SPEAKER_01]: student, but he said, Oh, oh yeah,
like I would love to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I applied and so I wanted to look
at concussion specifically with concussion
[SPEAKER_01]: and neuroinflammation in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he was happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right after that, we saw the call from
the NFL.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually outside watering my first
cannabis plant that I ever grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it came across my phone and I was
like, Patrick, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the NFL is actually putting up money
to study the thing that I just said,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I, this is what we want to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I didn't really think we would
apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that he'd be like, Hey,
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're not crazy, you know,
we're this is not some, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people think that, yeah, someone else
thinks this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was, but instead he was like,
okay, yeah, we're going to apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he went and he gathered and he's
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gathered people that he had worked
with over the course of his career to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at, like, we're looking at so many
different metrics, but we had to put in
[SPEAKER_01]: for it was an NIH adjudication to go
through, you know, all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers that applied for the funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we were selected as the group
that the NFL would fund to look at all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different metrics for using cannabinoids
for neuroinflammation, concussion,
[SPEAKER_01]: pain, and then opioid sparing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's my one supervisor that took me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm actually double supervised.
[SPEAKER_01]: My other supervisor is the Dean of
Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my PhD is in pharmacy at the University
of Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two are my supervisors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a team, an amazing team of
people that are looking at so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different metrics of, yeah, how we can use
cannabinoids to potentially reduce some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things, you know, so for me,
it's very personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have people in my life, like we are
surrounded by athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in sports and, you know,
you can only change so many rules and
[SPEAKER_01]: redesign a helmet and a mouth guard in so
many ways, but unless you're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on the molecular things inside
the skull, you're missing a massive
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to do something that I
believe, you know, we need the data and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why we're getting it to prove that
what, what we believe to be true is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: In humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a ton of preclinical,
there's a ton of animal models that show
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but because of the laws and the
prohibitor, you know, the prohibition and
[SPEAKER_01]: the inability for researchers to put this
substance in a human and actually draw
[SPEAKER_01]: data, which in Canada now is even doubly
ridiculous because people can walk down
[SPEAKER_01]: the street and buy it anywhere they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still actually very hard to do
research in Canada, even though at the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal level it's legal where we've been
legal there since 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's accessible to anybody in our
country that's over the legal age,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to do research was actually still very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's taken us so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was in 2021 and we just
finished the first portion of the clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I feel like there'd be a lot more
human data if the policies would have
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed researchers to do the research
that they've been trying to do for a
[SPEAKER_01]: really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I guess I didn't realize that that
Canada had those restrictions on research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, here in the States, we're familiar
with it because cannabis, it's a schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: one drug and you know, that has a lot of
limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's talk about rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We prefer descheduling, but I think we'll
take rescheduling just because it will
[SPEAKER_00]: open up some of that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't realize that Canada had the
same issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you'd think that it would be easier
than it really was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, you know, our ability to do
the clinical trial at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely at an advantage in
Canada, like the fact that we were able
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, we have the cannabis
research licenses in our labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we're actually able to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, you know, the requirements and
it's, it's really probably no different
[SPEAKER_01]: than any other like natural product
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just your ability to source
the things that you want to source because
[SPEAKER_01]: you still have to have the stability test,
the investigation brochures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, you have to find people that
actually have that quality and that grade
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cannabinoids that you want to use
because in order to do a clinical trial,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to be sure that any of the
effects that you're seeing aren't coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from some other reagents or something else
that's in the product, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the same as other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that the accessibility to the
product that you need in order to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that was very restrictive too,
because in order to go through,
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a no objection letter, you have to
have that on every single molecule that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in cannabis, because it has 500
bioactive molecules, you would need 500
[SPEAKER_01]: different brochures and investigators and
talks on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it really kind of handcuffs you to
what you can actually do and progress with
[SPEAKER_01]: because to get, so we had to start with a
CBD isolate because in order to do
[SPEAKER_01]: anything more than that, which,
you know, most of us, of course would want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do something more full spectrum or,
you know, there's reasons, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course it makes sense to do a clinical
trial with just the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see what is changing in
association with just that one molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were looking for better
outcomes, you could design it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know that that that's tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, so many different compounds
in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably even many that we haven't even
identified yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes things tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing is you can't do a
clinical trial if you can't identify
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the mechanisms of what it is
you're studying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're studying, you know,
but I think that that's where there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: real place for real world research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, because really at the
end of the day, what is the point of this
[SPEAKER_01]: research if it's not at least in parallel
or mirroring what people are accessing in
[SPEAKER_01]: real life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are some CBD products,
of course, that are isolates, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you were going to preferentially
pick a product, it likely wouldn't be an
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you know how cannabinoid
pharmacology works, you would try to
[SPEAKER_01]: design something better, but it's just for
the sake of a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, you know, some people are
like, well, why are you using an isolate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course it's not by choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because we had to, you know,
and then you progress from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the next couple of steps,
we'll be able to hopefully add in some
[SPEAKER_01]: more cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first to have, there is no data right
now at all, even on the CBD isolate,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that doesn't even exist in a healthy
population yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing by putting it into a
healthy population is still the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: it's ever been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, you know, the metrics on
Epidiolex, which is a CBD, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's not a healthy athletic
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in a population of epileptic
children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think one thing in cannabis
research where people really need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: careful is to identify the population that
whatever you're looking at was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: studied in, because you can't take metrics
from an epileptic child population and
[SPEAKER_01]: think that that equates to a healthy
athletic male population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two aren't the same, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As in same as an epileptic brain,
it's not the same as a non epileptic
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not the same, you know,
so I mean, we have to be really careful at
[SPEAKER_01]: what are we looking at when we're looking
at these studies and the studies that do
[SPEAKER_01]: exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in athletics, I think that makes it
really complicated because there is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there are, we do have research
that exists in certain things,
[SPEAKER_01]: humans, not so much as there's lots of
preclinical data, lots of animal data,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we have to be really careful in the
interpretation of, and that was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: points in the recent publication that I
put out in sports medicine was we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be careful with our interpretation of
research that does exist and not to take
[SPEAKER_01]: that research and apply it to populations
that it wasn't actually done on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, so I wanted to kind of just circle
back to the NFL because I know that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an important part of your research
and, you know, kind of getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: approval from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was funny because I was
looking back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our first event, our can first came
out event in 2016 was at Harvard Medical
[SPEAKER_00]: School.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kyle Turley, former NFL player,
actually attended and spoke there in a
[SPEAKER_00]: documentary and the film crew followed him
for Vice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was going back and I was and I
was watching some of that and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: clips of the NFL commissioner talking
about, you know, cannabis in the NFL and
[SPEAKER_00]: their policy around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his stance then was there's not enough
evidence to support changing anything at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight years later, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it's better late than never.
[SPEAKER_00]: But speak to kind of how attitudes from
the major sports organizations have
[SPEAKER_00]: changed when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have any thoughts of kind of
what was the tipping point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of thoughts on a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so that, you know, by them
saying that we don't have enough evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: to change our policies, that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they stuck with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NFL did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was actually the players that were
pressuring them saying, OK, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you keep saying you don't have the
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the data then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like figure out how to get the data
because you can 't just keep saying you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's kind of sometimes people
will say that as it's like an excuse to
[SPEAKER_01]: just keep bad policies in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same as people saying there's no
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tons of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have tons of research that is already
in the published literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just look like that, it's it's
excuses or these talking points,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, to just kind of leave things status
quo because it is a very disruptive space
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's very misunderstood because we
have that commercial industry to write a
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the NFL, it was the players that kind
of pressured them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, why are we so many years later
and we don't have the data?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the most complicated
things with cannabis and getting that data
[SPEAKER_01]: is the funding, because really clinical
trials are expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the people that are going to fund
clinical trials would be the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately somehow would have some benefit
from seeing the results right one way or
[SPEAKER_01]: the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the NFL truly does want the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they do with it is up to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just you know, we are just here to
get the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be really interesting to see
what they do with the data, because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you still have other people that
don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that ultimately right now,
because of the shift in the laws of our
[SPEAKER_01]: countries, the society is shifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the policies that they have in pro
sports and even I mean, the NCAA just
[SPEAKER_01]: removed cannabis from their prohibited
list, because those policies no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: align with society, like society is
changing their laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to have fluidity amongst
the game and the place of the game in
[SPEAKER_01]: society, the dysfunction, it was starting
to become too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that was one of the reasons
why they were, you know, they got
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in okay, well, let's see,
maybe we can put up some funding and find
[SPEAKER_01]: people to get the data then, because,
you know, it's the amount of money,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and yes, and there's a lot of
drug design for sure being done with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid molecules, because the
scaffolding of how they work, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will, I mean, we have data already to
show in animal models that there there is
[SPEAKER_01]: a ton of effect there in
neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we know that they are active
there, those molecules are active there,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that we now drug design has some
complicated things like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailability, you have to have
reproducible dose, you have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduced, you know, and then the
cannabinoid system itself is very
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at funding the clinical
trial, it's who would put money into that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because with a product that's available to
everybody right now with no prescription
[SPEAKER_01]: needed, and it will continue to be like
that industry is not going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whose benefit is it to put the money up
to do the research and even in the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial industry, they don't actually
need any data whatsoever to shelf a
[SPEAKER_01]: product, they don't need to show
pharmacokinetic data, they don't need to
[SPEAKER_01]: show bioavailability, they don't need to
show anything, they can package a product
[SPEAKER_01]: and sell it as long as they're following
the food and drug compliance, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: an FDA approved thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, there's no incentive for them to
fund it, because they actually don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: it, they can make an edible product and
just put it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's tricky to find anybody that it
would even would be interested in doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the NFL like I applaud them
really for doing it, because it shows that
[SPEAKER_01]: their minds are at least progressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not, you know, for a long
time, the conversation about cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine just had the brakes on,
like nobody wanted to talk about it or try
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand it, you know, and it's no
different than any pharmacological agent,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is bioactive, and it should be treated
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that in society, we've chosen to
make it available to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a different conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps should never have been
prohibited in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why we are in this place right now is a
different conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, how do we get out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I applaud the NFL for wanting to
actually see the data and putting up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the call for research,
because it is not an easy space to get
[SPEAKER_01]: funding for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like at least the first step
is the the publication that you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the title is Cannabinoid Therapy and
Athletics, a review of current cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: research to evaluate potential real world
cannabinoid applications in sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've looked through the paper and
there's there's a lot in there about a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of different uses for cannabinoids and
athletics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess in your opinion or in your
research, what are some of the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: or most promising applications of
cannabinoids and athletics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for me personally, like where I
think they can make the best difference or
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest difference for me for sure is
in neuroinflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think right now and and I might be
biased because that's what drew me to be
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in it in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think right now, I mean,
there's there's a difference, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: for where I think it should go and where
it is being used as athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are different things like athletes
currently right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, another part,
I'm gathering data to research athletes
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, like by talking to them and
interviewing them and also their medical
[SPEAKER_01]: training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have some publications coming out
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But athletes themselves have are using it
for primarily pain, inflammation,
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep and somewhat anxiety, you know,
mental health thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, where do I think for sure those
places will be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one place where I think it could
be very applicable is in neuroinflammation
[SPEAKER_01]: in the brain and concussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a few reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molecularly, it makes a ton of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why we could actually use these molecules
to invoke the same downstream effect as we
[SPEAKER_01]: would have by our naturally secreted
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But secondly, we don't currently have any
pharmacological agent that does anything
[SPEAKER_01]: for concussion or TBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a space where we're just sitting
there like there isn't anything that
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody can do to help somebody right now,
other than, you know, physical therapy,
[SPEAKER_01]: occupational therapy, those types of
things like vestibular training,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, balance and those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the pharmacological agent
goes, there isn't one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, it's like, why wouldn't you
want to investigate this when it could?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know statistically, like,
you know, contact sport athletes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they die from neurodegenerative disorders
at a three times greater rate than the
[SPEAKER_01]: population that doesn't play contact
sports.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that there's something
happening there with neurodegeneration and
[SPEAKER_01]: contact sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mechanisms of that, you know,
of course, biology is a network.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never linear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know from the statistics,
when you look at the neurodegeneration
[SPEAKER_01]: that absolutely they have a higher rate of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, the focus to focus on something
like that, which is your brain,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the metrics that we're looking at
in our clinical trial, we are looking at,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cerebral vascular changes in
your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how does the blood flow actually
change in your brain using cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at the oxygenation
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does the oxygen concentration
change in your brain when you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it comes down to really the
question of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can reduce that neural
inflammation, you can reduce the secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of that cascade and domino effect
that ultimately leads to neurodegenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: disorders, which is starting at,
you know, the secondary effect of what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens when you smash your head together
or, you know, what whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I do think also there's some
things with the peripheral, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: peripheral inflammation also, I believe
plays a role in it because you have so
[SPEAKER_01]: many circulating pro-inflammatory
signaling molecules that everything and
[SPEAKER_01]: really that's what inflammation is,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Inflammation is everybody thinks of it as
a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inflammation is a process of signaling
molecules that are calling in your immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system to signal them to either,
you know, come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to fix this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we got to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have to reduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have to shut off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're back to homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when inflammation is working
correctly and, and it should work
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body is designed to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inflammation only really is a problem when
it doesn't shut itself off or when it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's chronic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the brain, if you can't shut
off that inflammation in your brain and it
[SPEAKER_01]: continues to be inflamed, then you end up
with neurodegenerative disorders a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we had the opportunity to use these
molecules as pharmacological agents to get
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and reduce that neuroinflammation
at that time, I think it would be such an
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage to athletes, particularly but
also military.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also it just ripples out into
like the aging population and then all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these neurodegenerative disorders,
because it's all stemming from the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a setup in your brain and all
these cascading things, they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: different flavors of the same candy kind
of, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's all on the same mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just different portions are being
broken for lack of a better word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, let's dig into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how I mean, how ideally would
cannabinoids be used for neuroprotection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sort of like a preventive thing that
would be taken for anyone who's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: participating in these types of sports?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it sort of, okay, I've had a head
injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I need to take cannabinoids to,
like you said, cool that inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the million dollar question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there has been research done to look
at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really the short answer is both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can see so when you look at
neuroinflammation in the brain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to first look at your
endocannabinoid system, which is why and
[SPEAKER_01]: how cannabinoids work in your body at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your endocannabinoid system is when you
get conked in the head, you secrete
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids yourself, like
planticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't talking about cannabis,
but like you secrete endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when there is an injury,
a neural injury, your body will secrete
[SPEAKER_01]: those endocannabinoids to go and hit
receptors to essentially break the circuit
[SPEAKER_01]: of inflammation and calm it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in concussion, if you, at the time
of an acute injury, one approach would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, well, you could take cannabinoids
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some places like,
I think the Israeli military I read uses
[SPEAKER_01]: it on impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they get injured, they actually have a
nasal spray of a THC CBD that they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they nasally inhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at that time you can hit the CB1
receptor, which essentially shuts those
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium channels and it'll reduce the
amount of excitotoxin, like excitatory
[SPEAKER_01]: neurotransmitter, which is glutamate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hit that CB1 receptor, you can
actually reduce that out of control
[SPEAKER_01]: secretion that we know happens in
concussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take THC, which is
stereochemically basically identical to
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide, which is what you secrete
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't provide enough anandamide
yourself, like you can't keep up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of excitatory neurotoxin that's
being fired by your neuron.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't put out the fire yourself,
you can bring in an exogenous molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: such as THC to hit that same receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would actually cause the same
downstream results for all intents and
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it itself will reduce that firing of
the excitatory neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be on impact, but CBD does
something completely different and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, it's very promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to remember that every
molecule in cannabis functions differently
[SPEAKER_01]: than the next, like they don't all hit the
same receptors, which is why it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also we could be here for another 300
years studying it to figure out what's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's certain approaches of thinking
of taking CBD prophylactically to
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain, because CBD does something
basically for your own endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system where it helps you maintain healthy
and hearty endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it would help support your ability
to secrete and use your own anandamide and
[SPEAKER_01]: 2-AG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go into all of them, but one of
the big ones really CBD does is it
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibits the pha enzyme, which is the
enzyme that breaks down your own
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide, which is the thing that hits
that CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some thoughts that taking CBD
prophylactically on a consistent basis
[SPEAKER_01]: will allow your own endocannabinoid system
to have what it needs to make those
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids at the time that the
injury is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in sports, you can pretty much bank on
the fact that you're going to get slammed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in contact sports, you know the hits
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an if, it's when.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's small hits, big hits,
whatever, to your body, to your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that those pro-inflammatory
cytokines are going to start firing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reactive oxygen species,
you know that that's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the approach should be to do
everything that you can to give your body
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability to reduce it when it does
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so using cannabinoids, and also you
have to remember in sports, too,
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is cognitively impairing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to be careful with how
things affect your decision making or your
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction time or things like that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas CBD is not cognitively impairing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can take it and it wouldn't
affect your output as an athlete.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two schools of thought there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But personally, for me, I think and again,
that's why a lot of the research that does
[SPEAKER_01]: exist, you have to be very careful because
the devil's in the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there are some studies that were
looking at CBD and how effective CBD was
[SPEAKER_01]: at reducing inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they only looked at it for,
you know, for three hours post
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think they were doing a workout
protocol, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they looked at it and, you know,
it didn't do much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in my opinion, I think the
prophylactic approach is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: better because I think if you're taking it
leading up to whatever you're doing and
[SPEAKER_01]: that has been shown in the research that,
yes, having it on board before does seem
[SPEAKER_01]: to help when the impact does happen or the
inflammation does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBD seems to work better when there is
inflammation in play already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your cells aren't already in the
process of inflammation, CBD is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it doesn't really have a lot of
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for inflammation, I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when things are inflaming,
you upregulate a lot of your
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid receptors, which means the
concentration of available receptors to
[SPEAKER_01]: hit has increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now CBD has something to work on.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's again, you have to look really at
what was the population and what was going
[SPEAKER_01]: on at what we were studying or what was
that research done on and then so and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't really apply what was found in
that to a different situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I think for athletes taking it,
I think, take it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you did have a head contact,
then there would be a place for sure to
[SPEAKER_01]: take it immediately after.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hasn't been proven out anywhere
because we can't, you know, we haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: done it in humans yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have animal models.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have mice models, you know,
looking at what happens in their brain
[SPEAKER_01]: when we honk them in the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and they they have a massive secretion
of two AG and anandamide, which are your
[SPEAKER_01]: natural endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also have a big upregulation in
the CB2 receptors, which are the receptors
[SPEAKER_01]: that are on the microglia, which are the
immune cells in your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that experiment with the mice,
if you gave them an exogenous source of
[SPEAKER_01]: two AG, the inflammation reduced quickly
and you can save the neurons and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: save the tissue and it recovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in theory, you know, mice aren't
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in theory, that would be what you
would be looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, again, to make it from a farm grade,
you'd have to have, you know, a farm grade
[SPEAKER_01]: product to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my opinion, we we have a product
that does it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we know the cannabis plant can
do it in some degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like we don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why if you know you have something that
might have a benefit, why wouldn't you try
[SPEAKER_01]: it rather than sit there and do nothing
and let the inflammation just cascade out
[SPEAKER_01]: of control?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you do it correctly,
we know that CBD has a really high safety
[SPEAKER_01]: safety profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is as long as it's made in the right
way, because these days these days you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be careful where you're sourcing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, if if you get good quality
CBD, we know that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just think, you know, why wouldn't
you try it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that's it's a common refrain
when we talk about sort of cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is there's a lot of upside and
not a whole lot of downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not try?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so you mentioned that,
you know, perhaps the Israeli military is
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of using a nasal spray for for
treating head injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your knowledge, are any sports teams or
athletics or do they use CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they kind of have it as a protocol?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they experimenting with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well, again, loaded question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So protocol, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, when it comes down to
experimenting with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that athletes themselves
do anecdotally or from each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have heard and they have learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a separate thing from then
looking at league and league policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of leagues, even in Canada,
like, I mean, in 2018, cannabis became
[SPEAKER_01]: federally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, OK, if you're an adult,
you can use it the same way you use beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this is not an illegal substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in youth sport, which is the
equivalent of the NCAA in 2020,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was actually stated that, like,
we will no longer test athletes for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's not a thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the progress isn't made to then.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you going to develop protocols?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to teach your medical
training staff how to use this or how to
[SPEAKER_01]: inform the athletes how to use it
properly?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the portion of my PhD that I'm
working on right now is really informing
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical staff, because so what I was
gathering was data to see, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much do they even know about cannabis
or what do they think about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, in Canada, we had an
opportunity because we made it legal five
[SPEAKER_01]: over five years ago to really create
teaching opportunities for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't even just for athletics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for all medical professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is still a massive lack of education
in our doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we ask our doctors, when we
gathered statistics just from a general
[SPEAKER_01]: population standpoint, our doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, how many of you have had a patient
come to you and ask you for advice or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some sort of guidance to use
cannabis as a medication or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: authorization to use cannabis instead of
something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you guys have had that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we wanted to know, like,
is this common?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety two percent of them have had a
patient come and ask them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like almost 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so then we looked at, well,
what are the barriers to like proper care?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, only six percent of them had ever
had any kind of education on using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or cannabinoid molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the barrier is obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that it's the education they are not
taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't have confidence to provide
any kind of guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that creates a problem, right,
because the product is available there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, you know, rather than using a
medical professional to maybe help you
[SPEAKER_01]: guide them, they're just going straight to
the budtenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because they don't need a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you've done now is you've actually
taken the patient out of the health care
[SPEAKER_01]: system rather than keeping them in the
health care system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a it's a pharmacologically active
agent, like if anything, you should want
[SPEAKER_01]: to have somebody there to guide you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you have to remember,
our doctors are very busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have enough doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have like three minutes with every
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like they don't have a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabinoid as a therapeutic,
it takes an interaction with your patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to spend time with them and the
patient has to be willing to toy with the
[SPEAKER_01]: levels that they're taking in the amounts
because everybody has a different optimal
[SPEAKER_01]: dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I personally think that we could
have an entire undergrad degree just
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching people how, you know,
the endocannabinoid system and how we use
[SPEAKER_01]: it as a therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope one day that we can do that,
because the doctors, they're too busy,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're aiming at the wrong people
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in athletics, when I went was
interviewing medical staff there,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're busy, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now you have a different population
because your job is to keep these
[SPEAKER_01]: athletes, which are million dollar
athletes, safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're million dollar athletes
are interested in this substance and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're able to access it and you don't
have any kind of rules against it,
[SPEAKER_01]: which the NFL still has rules that certain
just in preseason, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then but it's like if they can access
it, then your responsibility as a health
[SPEAKER_01]: care provider is to be able to provide
them with information and guidance about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not OK to just be like pretend,
you know, like look the other way and
[SPEAKER_01]: pretend we don't know what's happening,
which is pretty much what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, but everybody is scared of the
hierarchy and of who sets the rules and
[SPEAKER_01]: who you answer to, including the athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't necessarily want to talk to
somebody in their team about it because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're worried that they're going to get
in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the medical staff are worried
that they're going to get in trouble if
[SPEAKER_01]: they were giving them sort of sort of
guidance on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the NCAA removing it as a
prohibited substance has created a space,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you're going to remove it,
then you have to teach them how to use it
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibly the same way that you did with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the this whole punishment model,
that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The abstinent thing doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the athletes say that it's offensive
to the medical staff when they're learning
[SPEAKER_01]: this message where it does not align with
what we see in society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so athletes and a lot of them are
actually gravitating towards cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: different reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're choosing it over other
things for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, alcohol, alcohol,
you know, there's a next day effect in
[SPEAKER_01]: athletics that takes up time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hung over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't train.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lose a day when they spent Saturday
night drinking 16 beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they spent Saturday night, they ate a
gummy just as just totally recreationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the next day they they probably sat
at home, ate something and went to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next day they can train.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably have their inflammation
reduced and they can carry on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the difference in dysfunction now
that we see is like the regulations aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: lining up with reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's to find a way to correctly and
put in place the policies that align with
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you don't, you're fractioning
the trust of your athletes towards their
[SPEAKER_01]: team and you're fractioning, you know,
the trust that they have that you're able
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually care for them in all
capacities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you can't answer their
questions about this one thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just going to bolt and go find
their information somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would think in an athlete
population, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people who are very hyper aware
of their bodies and how they perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're always trying to get an edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have people jumping into
cold plunges and having different diets
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that, you know, cannabinoids
as a way to reduce your inflammation or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe reduce your anxiety so that you can
perform better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would imagine a lot of athletes are
very interested in that or are
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing is they are
experimenting with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are training with it and they have
found results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these guys, you know, and they
learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if one they're like ants, like if one
guy has a good experience, they'll tell
[SPEAKER_01]: the next guy, the next guy, you know,
before you know it, then they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: trying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things like it does legitimately
have molecular mechanisms that do reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that can help you recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to prove that out in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in theory, so if they're feeling that
you can't tell them that what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling is incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're feeling, you know, if it does
reduce their inflammation and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where the dysfunction is
between research and the real world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think cannabis is one of the places
where I mean, I can't even think of
[SPEAKER_01]: another one where research is further from
real world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the real world, they're doing
stuff like I mean, athletes, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: work with athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll try exactly like you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they want an advantage and they
want ways to, you know, advantage their
[SPEAKER_01]: body because their body is their most
important tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is their most valuable tool is their
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very intentional about what
they put inside it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not messing around with things
that they think are going to hurt them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they try something once and they're
like, yeah, I didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they try something and they're
like, okay, well, you know, whatever hurt
[SPEAKER_01]: before doesn't hurt anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I was able to recover faster,
you know, but then there are the laws for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're going on Google or
whatever to get their information.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no place for them to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know how to find good
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the question is like,
well, would they even ask their team
[SPEAKER_01]: anyways?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they did ask their team,
what could the team even offer them as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as answers go?
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently not much like it's and now
the NCAA is in the exact same spot because
[SPEAKER_01]: they've removed it as a prohibited
substance, which I applaud them for doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that because it didn't make any sense to
have it prohibited anymore because there
[SPEAKER_01]: are valid places where athletes should be
able to use cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one place that comes to mind because
it came up a lot was female athletes and
[SPEAKER_01]: they use it for once a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are doubled over in pain with
menstrual cramps and cannabinoids work
[SPEAKER_01]: amazingly for reducing because menstrual
pain is both neurological and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: nociceptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have neurons firing and you have
tissue inflaming and cannabinoids can get
[SPEAKER_01]: at both of those to reduce them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does work really well in female
athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you had female athletes that would
prefer to use that instead of an NSAID or
[SPEAKER_01]: any other type of drug, but if they did,
they were at risk of losing their
[SPEAKER_01]: scholarship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was wrong in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they shouldn't have to worry about
that and then have to take whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: prescription or other drugs that you say
is good when they would prefer to use
[SPEAKER_01]: something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the autonomy over their own choices,
I think is also making it, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: athletes are voicing that more now than
they did before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely think, yeah, I think the
athletes for sure are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying different things as they
always do, that's not new.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times athletes, like you call it
bro science, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like bro science is always about 10 years
ahead of actual science and half the time
[SPEAKER_01]: they're right and half the time they like
harm themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, a lot of the times they come
out with like these guys and just do it
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're like, okay, well,
I'm just going to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like then science catches up,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But bro science, there's something to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny, you see it in cannabis
cultivation too, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers, they're not trained
scientists or whatever, but they know what
[SPEAKER_00]: works and they've been using it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only now the researchers are coming
along and understanding like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, this is the mechanism and that's why
that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that cannabis, honestly,
like I laugh all the time because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: been backwards since the beginning of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what other substance, like,
you know, Mushulam wanted to know why
[SPEAKER_01]: people were getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in 64, like the isolated,
like the THC molecule, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we went completely backwards as far as
like usually in pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for an agent to cause an
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this place, we already had the
effect and we were trying to look for the
[SPEAKER_01]: agent, like it's backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had no idea how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we discovered this enormous
endocannabinoid system because we
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered this molecule in a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like normally, you know, what system
you're working in and you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's completely backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we discovered like isolated the
molecule and then happened to discover the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest neurophysiological receptor system
in your body because we were looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: what, like it's just, it was completely
backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think, you know, I laugh because
it's like almost everything is backwards
[SPEAKER_01]: in it, in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I, I think it's an opportunity
really for people to learn so many things
[SPEAKER_01]: about so many things by studying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, instead of going backwards,
let's look forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what new studies are, are you working
on or are you excited about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are in the works when it,
when it comes to cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: athletics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just finished the first part of our NFL
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we were looking at before we
could go into the next part is we really
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to see what is the optimal dose of
CBD in an athlete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nobody knows, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you hear it all the time in people
arguing over like low dose, high dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I, you know, nobody really knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a group of athletes that
these poor guys give so much blood every
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks, but we had an escalating dose
and we got them up to a pretty high
[SPEAKER_01]: amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we're going to calculate out
what would be, what would appear to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal dose just based on, you know,
the serum levels and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, then the next part is we're
going to use that optimal dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually going to do a double
blind crossover in a season of football.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're using athletes in Canada in,
in football season, and we're going to use
[SPEAKER_01]: the product that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where it's going to get really
exciting because we're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: compare the group that's using the
cannabinoids compared to the group that
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the metrics that we're looking at in
that is like so exciting to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're looking at, you know,
a couple of things I mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that are happening in the
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the cerebral oxygenation and the
cerebral blood flow, but we're also
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the bioinflammatory markers to
look at what the changes are in that when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're taking cannabinoids versus when
you're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're also going to look at,
of course, the pain scores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to look at the concussion
scores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to look at the contractility
of their heart because we want to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the, because your heart is electrical and
the endocannabinoid system functions on
[SPEAKER_01]: ions essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to look at the heart and
the differences in the contractility and
[SPEAKER_01]: blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have, we're looking at sleep
scores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at their mental status.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, we're going to be able to pull so
much data out of this specific to
[SPEAKER_01]: athletes, which hasn't been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like athletes just haven't really been
studied because, you know, they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy population.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, you know, they really are
representative of a great number of people
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like weekend warriors or people
that are generally healthy, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like people that want, that are looking
for, you know, you could consider it a
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement really like a supplement agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is really exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that really excites me
is the progress that's being made right
[SPEAKER_01]: now in biophysics, which is looking really
at the ion exchanges between like all of
[SPEAKER_01]: your cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually when you're looking at ion
movements, it's, you know, brain waves,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we know that your neurons function
on electricity and your heart functions on
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with recent research, we've been able
to see that the ion movements between all
[SPEAKER_01]: the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a communication system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a communication system that
typically, you know, we know your body
[SPEAKER_01]: runs on biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's looking at the chemistry of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But above that, it's actually physics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ion exchanges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you look at, that's one of the
things we're looking at in the brain is
[SPEAKER_01]: the brain oscillations also using the
cannabinoids because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: information there, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the future for that is,
is really bright, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it'll develop a whole new
way to treat bodies, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sick bodies too, because right now we
treat them with, you know, medication or
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are targeting receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we could develop the ability to,
like a quick example of cancer cells,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you can see a cell that's about to
turn cancerous because there's a change
[SPEAKER_01]: basically in the bioelectric frequency of
the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see it by the change in the
ions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could, in theory, use that
information to then reverse it by using
[SPEAKER_01]: ions and electricity rather than
chemistry, you could potentially find ways
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually push physiology again,
just using a different mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, I'm always looking at how
do you push physiology without drugs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, you know, and so that,
and that really was the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system to me is, I think there's a lot
going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it started with me looking
at it because you can push that system
[SPEAKER_01]: without the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can invoke it with exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can invoke it with meditation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cold plunge that you just talked about
before, when you shock it, you secrete
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so singing, you know, you secrete them
when you sing, you secrete them when you
[SPEAKER_01]: dance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like a lot of the things,
again, that historically and traditionally
[SPEAKER_01]: and culturally were used for therapeutic
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it was like throw science
culture mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they were doing it and they were
doing dancing and chanting and nobody knew
[SPEAKER_01]: why it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we come to find out, oh,
wow, they're secreting a massive amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide when they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that makes perfect sense because
anandamide is named that because it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: bliss molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes a lot of sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they always knew to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have the technology to actually
prove out molecularly why it is true,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they always knew that it was working.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, way back when.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that for me, it's an exciting
space to be in because you're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: your neurons and you're looking at your
like the immune system, which to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: really, I mean, it touches everything in
your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that that is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping up, Liz, I want to give you an
opportunity to share any other resources
[SPEAKER_00]: or papers that you know of that you think
their listeners might be interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: reading up on if they're curious about
some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also any website, social media or
ways that people can connect with you to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the paper that I recently published,
the one that you mentioned is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Sports Medicine Journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our protocol for what we're doing
for our clinical trial was just published
[SPEAKER_01]: in BMC Neurology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that lists all of the different
metrics that we're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: in our athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's of interest to anybody,
they can search that one up too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't really have a lot of
social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have there's a website, a research
website, basically that just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: updates what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's trainwithmaryjane.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on Instagram, it's just trainwith
.maryjane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not a ton on there,
but there's, you know, just updates,
[SPEAKER_01]: brief updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll put links to all of that stuff
in the show description so people can have
[SPEAKER_00]: an easy way to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Liz, thanks again for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fascinating stuff that you're
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited to see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we'll see you down at Can
Med real soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for having me.
