[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the Senior Marketing Manager at
Medicinal Genomics and proud member of the
[SPEAKER_00]: team that puts on the CanMed Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CanMed 25 speaker lineup is up on
canmedevents.com along with our
[SPEAKER_00]: preliminary schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a stellar lineup this year
including some familiar names,
[SPEAKER_00]: some returning presenters, and some new
faces as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll all be in Puerto Rico this June
for the CanMed 25 Innovation and
[SPEAKER_00]: Investment Summit and you can join them
for a fraction of the full price if you
[SPEAKER_00]: register before February 19th,
which is our early bird deadline.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information is up at canmedevents
.com and I hope to see you this June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Dr. Michelle Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle is an internationally recognized
forensic toxicologist and a full professor
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Department of Forensic Sciences at
Virginia Commonwealth University.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been funded by the National
Institute of Justice to study the
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferation of semi-synthetic THC
analogs in the unregulated market and
[SPEAKER_00]: define their relevant biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her work impacts public health and public
safety policies and initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 25, Michelle will present Why
Some People Green Out, the Analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: Unregulated Hemp-derived Cannabis
Products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her team study uses a liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
[SPEAKER_00]: method to analyze unregulated hemp
products and she found that all products
[SPEAKER_00]: that they analyzed were mislabeled in some
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either misrepresenting the cannabinoids
contained therein or their concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss what
has caused the rise of semi-synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids in the marketplace,
how Michelle got involved in testing
[SPEAKER_00]: unregulated hemp and cannabis products,
some of the adverse events that have
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred from consuming semi-synthetic
cannabinoids, how the LS-MS method allows
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle's team to see compounds other
labs can't, how consumers can protect
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves from mislabeled products,
and whether federal legalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis would eliminate the
semi-synthetic market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Michelle, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Preach Biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preach Biotech Corporation is a vertically
integrated company dedicated to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, manufacture, and dispensing
of medicinal cannabis in Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: With over 500,000 square feet of
state-of-the-art facilities, Preach uses
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest standards of agricultural and
manufacturing practices to guarantee the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest standard of medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their mission is to offer a natural and
unique experience through medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that raises the patient's
well-being and quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at PreachBiotech.com,
and Preach is spelled P-R-I-C-H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle Pease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Michelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited for the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for the conversation,
and I'd like to say that we're excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: have you as an oral presenter at CanMed
25.
[SPEAKER_00]: We announced the lineup just last week,
and I might be biased here, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of the strongest lineups we've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great mix of familiar names and new
faces, and if I'm not mistaken,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are a new face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you attended a CanMed event before?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to be able to attend so
that I can learn from this side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: community and also be a part of the
conversations about how do we help
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers be safe and still address health
issues along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to be able to attend
and present, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, and I expect that your talk is
going to be well attended since it covers
[SPEAKER_00]: a very hot topic in the industry right
now, which is semi-synthetic cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: or hemp-derived cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more than one presentation
touching on the topic, and we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: working on putting together a panel
discussion about it, which I'm hoping you
[SPEAKER_00]: can participate on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps for those who aren't familiar,
could you give us a quick primer on the
[SPEAKER_00]: current situation with semi-synthetic or
hemp-derived cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they, how are they made,
and why are they seemingly everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: these days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they everywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the hemp-derived semi-synthetic
compounds that we see that are so popular
[SPEAKER_01]: in the marketplace, we believe really was
given birth because of the explosion of
[SPEAKER_01]: the production of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because the CBD marketplace really
reached market saturation, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: it then lost value.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty simple supply and demand
business model, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're not making as much
money with that product or you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: excess stores of it sitting around,
it just gets harder to sell, then we
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that manufacturers thought about,
well, what can we do with what we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: then also push the marketplace?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the 2018 Farm Bill, the
Agricultural Improvement Act, has a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: very broad language in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that broad language,
manufacturers had the space to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce these other compounds from CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so through fairly straightforward
chemical processes, you can make an array
[SPEAKER_01]: of analogs that look like CBD or
T-deltanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the scientific literature actually
explained how to do this, how to make some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these chemical reactions to make other
kinds of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just slightly tweaking some of
those foundational chemical reactions can
[SPEAKER_01]: lead to an array of different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we wind up having now is there
are places on that molecular structure of
[SPEAKER_01]: tetrahydrocannabinol that can be modified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's say that's three different
regions on that molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you've got any arrangement that
is in those three areas, you are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to create hundreds of different
kinds of analogs from that, because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's three places that that molecule
right now can be modified and modified
[SPEAKER_01]: easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you take a look at those three
areas and you modify each of those
[SPEAKER_01]: sections, you've got an array of compounds
that can be manufactured from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because there is looseness in the
final product, farm bill language,
[SPEAKER_01]: and because there has been some confusion
as to what these compounds are from a
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory perspective, from a legal
perspective, that has just allowed,
[SPEAKER_01]: while we lay in that confusion,
then the marketplace has just been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: be as creative as it possibly can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's really monitoring the quality of
these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a forensic scientist, what I know
is that when there is space left in
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory language, then nefarious
activity will take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying everybody who has
entered into this space has nefarious
[SPEAKER_01]: intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that there are certainly
some players in this industry who are
[SPEAKER_01]: generating maybe quality products for
reasons to help consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, I still don't
believe my perspective and the hundreds,
[SPEAKER_01]: if not thousands of products that we've
evaluated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we can still trust what is in these
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think at the end of the day,
I think that there's a lot of nefarious
[SPEAKER_01]: activity because it's an easy way to make
money without oversight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you mentioned the broad language of
the farm bill has sort of opened the door
[SPEAKER_00]: for this to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I understand correctly,
is it the fact that it only specifies
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 9 THC as being sort of the sort of
the banned cannabinoid or the one that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that determines whether it's it's hemp or
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly is, you know, that at the time
that the farm bill was written,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there was just concern about
that singular compound and its place in
[SPEAKER_01]: the DEA's controlled substances act on
schedule one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because that is the named compound,
then it's it's you you there's place for
[SPEAKER_01]: other compounds to exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like you said, you have all these
manufacturers or farmers are sitting on
[SPEAKER_00]: this glut of CBD, which was really what
seemed to be the intention of the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: bill was to kind of you know, create a
marketplace for CBD, which then got
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had to get creative with how
do we turn this into a different compound?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would even say, was that really
the intention of the farm bill?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: The intention of the farm bill was to
allow people to grow hemp and to grow hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: for non pharmaceutical purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know, from t shirts to bed
sheets to animal bedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so I think that was the
original intent of the of the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we certainly have seen
nationwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely see it here in Virginia,
where the language was used in the process
[SPEAKER_01]: of of Virginia wrestling with the Virginia
code.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are we what are we going to
legalize or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there were definitely lobbyists
who got up and said, we want to do this
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're making rope, not dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, at the end of the day,
everybody really knew that they wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow hemp to be able to extract CBD from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so I think that the
intention of the farm bill was to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers a pathway to grow another kind of
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and, you know, we need to close up
those and fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I was hoping you could you explain
sort of what motivated you to start
[SPEAKER_00]: studying these these cannabinoids and
these compounds and their their
[SPEAKER_00]: implications?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's actually a long arc to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm funded by the National Institute of
Justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been funded by them since 2014 to
evaluate electronic cigarettes and how
[SPEAKER_01]: they can be used and manipulated to vape
drugs other than nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'll be honest,
we always thought that THC and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: was low hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought somebody's going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really need to be in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were really concerned originally and
still are about people putting
[SPEAKER_01]: methamphetamine and cocaine and fentanyl
and, you know, their anti-anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were concerned about how they were
going to use e-cigarettes to vape those
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of compounds and what implications
it had in the criminal justice system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we really began monitoring was
the nature of the unregulated nicotine
[SPEAKER_01]: e-cigarette marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we came we came to really paint the
picture of what was happening in that
[SPEAKER_01]: unregulated space and how it was creating
problems for consumers in addition to how
[SPEAKER_01]: you use them to vape other drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody sent us a THC vape and they
said, surely this isn't THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and it was labeled as 75% THC,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we analyzed it, it was really
more like 40% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still a lot of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we thought, oh, this is the same thing
is going to happen in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is what we're seeing in the
nicotine industry because we had already
[SPEAKER_01]: published on and was characterizing
nicotine vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the unregulated ones, you can't trust
what's on that package either in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: the nicotine concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really what set us off to now
the industry has my attention,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started monitoring the quality of
those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw sorry not to not to cut you
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the unregulated products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, unregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw the cannabis industry use the
consumers as their test market for
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw the chemical profiles of vaping
products evolve pretty rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're watching the CBD
marketplace as well and analyzing those
[SPEAKER_01]: products too, which also you couldn't
trust the quality of those products
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we received a product from
somebody who said, listen, I consume a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis and this vape is not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sent it to us and we found a
really dangerous synthetic cannabinoid in
[SPEAKER_01]: five-fluoro ADB.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was the moment we realized,
yep, nobody's monitoring this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enforcement is awful in the states that do
have regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the industry has our full
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was a pretty public debate
after we published that paper where we
[SPEAKER_01]: found the five-fluoro ADB in a CBD product
that was marketed as safe for children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what was the unintended consequence
of that very public debate right in the
[SPEAKER_01]: media from the New York Times to Consumer
Reports, AARP, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started receiving products from people
who were having adverse events from taking
[SPEAKER_01]: a cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started analyzing those and
realizing that for a certain period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, all of the products were either
mislabeled or contained as synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're watching the CBD marketplace in
terms of what's happening with this now
[SPEAKER_01]: oversupply that's being generated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw the Delta-8 THC hit the
marketplace and we do a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: surveillance shopping and secret shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went into a store to see if Delta-8
THC was in my community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I walked in and there was almost a
line out the door to buy Delta-8 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to manage the crowd,
the store clerk said, we need you to read
[SPEAKER_01]: this document that was taped to the
display case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had an outright lie about the
nature of Delta-8 on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says Delta-8 is like CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that's fantastically
dangerous because it underscores the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability of the industry to outright lie
about the compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started then acquiring the Delta-8
products and then we saw Delta-10 in the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace and 6A, 10A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started seeing some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I received a case that in which
the consumer had such strong adverse
[SPEAKER_01]: event, I mean, outright disassociation and
hallucinations and paranoia that he
[SPEAKER_01]: committed a egregious felony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now he's facing criminal charges and
life in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I received the product that he
consumed and that's when we identified
[SPEAKER_01]: THC-O acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then started seeing all of the new
products misinformation and disinformation
[SPEAKER_01]: about THC-O acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I am fully committed now to
monitoring this emerging marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are now funded by the National
Institute of Justice to monitor the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace, develop methods to analyze
for all of the analogs that are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also assess how do crime labs and
hospital clinical labs and like for people
[SPEAKER_01]: who are having adverse events,
you need to properly attribute what that
[SPEAKER_01]: adverse event is to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, and we do surveillance shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why the NIJ is currently funded
us to specifically look at these THC
[SPEAKER_01]: analogs and how they've penetrated
different marketplaces and how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: analyze for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a long story as to how I got
invested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it has points in there as to
what happens when nobody's watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did want to ask you more sort of
about these adverse events that folks are
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing before they sort of reach out
or send those products to you for
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned the THC-O acetate as
being one of the more harmful cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something you might be able to shed
some light on what are sort of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: concerning of these cannabinoids and what
sort of adverse events are they producing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so let's start with the kinds of
adverse events that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, from a physiological
perspective, you know, from the point of
[SPEAKER_01]: view from what's happening to the body and
the body organs, we're definitely seeing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, respiratory problems,
cardiac problems, you know, that are
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly disconcerting at best and life
threatening at worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, from this cognitive behavioral
perspective, you know, we see where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people are, they have extreme
paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are dissociating from their body.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're having severe hallucinations,
terrifying hallucinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when you take all of that
into consideration, you know, these can be
[SPEAKER_01]: life altering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've certainly had cases in my
lab in which the person is affected,
[SPEAKER_01]: has been affected after consuming one of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years later are still having significant
problems and have had two cases in which
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody reported having seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was one case here in
Richmond, Virginia, where somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased a product and was at an outdoor
concert and had a seizure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had to stop the concert and get
her medical attention to go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and this was an unregulated
product that she purchased in a shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and, you know, to paint
the, you don't know what's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the claim was that that same
joint was shared with two other people and
[SPEAKER_01]: the other two people did not have a
seizure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so this is part of the
difficulty with these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in terms of the adverse effects that
they can have.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and this is, I guess, to reiterate,
this is from the unregulated market and
[SPEAKER_00]: largely because there are people in
certain places that do not have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-9-THC because it's banned in that
state or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they're looking for it elsewhere and
are, you know, kind of at the mercy of the
[SPEAKER_00]: actors who are producing these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think some of the other
challenges that, you know, we can't say
[SPEAKER_01]: that with any certainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say we can't say at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't even hint to that this list of
cannabinoids analogs is more dangerous
[SPEAKER_01]: than this list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is that there is
very little scientific research that has
[SPEAKER_01]: been conducted on the safety or the
efficacy of any of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that's some of the
challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other challenge is that you can't,
you don't know how much somebody is
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's the other challenge in all of
this is that you can't believe how much
[SPEAKER_01]: the package says that's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't know what the list of
compounds is that's in it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we have found that,
you know, there are some products that
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe list two compounds on the package
and contain seven compounds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's the accumulation of effects
from all of those compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, I mean, obviously you can't speak
for the manufacturer, but do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's intentional in terms of,
you know, they know that there's these
[SPEAKER_00]: additional compounds or is it just such a
messy process to create them that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, additional compounds being
created that, you know, maybe weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: intended?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are, you know, some
manufacturers that because nobody's
[SPEAKER_01]: looking, nobody's watching, nobody's
enforcing anything, honestly, nobody's
[SPEAKER_01]: analyzing those compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The products, there's only a handful of
labs in the nation that are able to
[SPEAKER_01]: analyze these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lab is one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, when you can't even attribute,
you know, an event to a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: compound, you know, then the conclusion
usually winds up being, well, it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis product or it was a THC product
when it probably wasn't or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably contained something else or had
way too much in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list is at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, and now you mentioned being able to
test for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you used a specific
technique for this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could speak briefly
about kind of what that method is and why
[SPEAKER_00]: it was chosen for the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we use our primary instrument for
analysis is liquid chromatography with a
[SPEAKER_01]: tandem mesh spectrometer attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use that instrument for almost
every analysis we do in my lab anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is that,
one, it is very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when you've got analytes, compounds
that are in trace amounts in products,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you need to have an instrument that's
going to allow you a really, really low
[SPEAKER_01]: limit of detection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning you can look at things at very,
very low concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the LC-MS allows us to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second reason why we use the LC tandem
aspect is because we can get we can
[SPEAKER_01]: identify the molecule itself, meaning the
molecular structure of a compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right, we break that compound into
fragments and we analyze those and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: break those fragments up again and we
analyze those and we can assemble all of
[SPEAKER_01]: those fragments and determine what the
original chemical structure is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for most of the cannabinoids,
we're able to identify them that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some of the cannabinoids we
can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's just because, you know,
if you take a look at, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: delta eight and delta nine THC,
you know, those the difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: those molecules is just a shift in that
double bond, the location of that double
[SPEAKER_01]: bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for some of those, we call those
isobars, for some of those compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't tell the difference between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if that's the case, then we have
another instrument that we use that can
[SPEAKER_01]: separate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the LC tandem aspect is our primary
instrument and then we use a GC-MS as a
[SPEAKER_01]: support instrument so that we can
determine, you know, what the exact
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid profile is in a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, how does that method or technology
compare to your standard cannabis testing
[SPEAKER_00]: lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, standard testing lab is using what
we call an HPLC with, it's like a UV,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a UV detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a HPLC DAD or PDA, it's a UV
detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, the challenge with that detector
is that you cannot assess the structure of
[SPEAKER_01]: the molecular compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that detector essentially absorbs
energy and emits energy from the compound
[SPEAKER_01]: will absorb energy and emit energy and
you're able to, you know, separate those
[SPEAKER_01]: through the chromatography.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, because it doesn't give you any
kind of structural information,
[SPEAKER_01]: then if compounds are really similar,
then you can't really, and they're coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out at the same time, you don't know that
you have two compounds in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't ascertain what those are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, at least with the LC tandem aspect,
you know, we're able to determine the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, several years ago, me and several of
my colleagues, we started a quality
[SPEAKER_01]: assurance testing lab for the cannabis
industry here in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were, you know, we were doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were, you know, this was our side
hustle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this was, you know, we're gonna
build it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be, you know, we're going to
be a scientific voice in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also going, because we're
forensic scientists, we're going to use
[SPEAKER_01]: the instruments that give us the best
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that was going to be the LC tandem
aspect to do potency testing, knowing that
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of the industry was using this
HPLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we had a client come to us who had
three different lab results for the same
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were vastly different in and of
themselves, those three results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, we don't know which one to
believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when we ran the product, it was light
years different from what is now the
[SPEAKER_01]: cluster of the original three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was because that product,
we were able to see on the LC-MS,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could differentiate between Delta A and
Delta nine THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the HPLC at the time, you could not
differentiate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right, so we knew early on in the
nature, in the emergence of these
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that LC-MS gave us the ability
to differentiate between the different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but, you know, that also made us a
unique voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, the industry was not happy with
us, you know, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we, came out very strong, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because remember, that's a, that's a,
a for-profit laboratory, research
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory at the time is investigating
all of these emerging analogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, we're seeing not only that the
concentration of all these analogs are not
[SPEAKER_01]: what's on the label and that there's more
of them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also finding residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also finding contaminations like
hair and dirt in products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, you know, high in microbiological
counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I came out really, really strongly
against Delta A in Virginia when it first
[SPEAKER_01]: emerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, our business dried up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so we, we had to shutter the
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't regret it, not one bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we always said we were going to
stand by the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to stand by quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took very seriously our job to
protect consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's, that's the way it should
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for the example that you just
mentioned with the, the producer who was
[SPEAKER_00]: getting different results from the labs
took it to you and you were able to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of see the difference between Delta A,
Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that a flower product?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was not a flower product.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, yeah, I was going to be surprised
because it was my understanding that Delta
[SPEAKER_00]: 8 is made only in very, very trace amounts
by the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see, we see that flower products are
sprayed with Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it wouldn't have been
surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wouldn't have been a surprising
result even if it, even if it had been a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower product, but that wasn't a flower
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing is you were
mentioning, or, you know, one of the key
[SPEAKER_00]: findings in your study here is the
mislabeling of the different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was curious, how much of that do you
think could be attributed to the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: folks are using different equipment than
yours and are not able to see sort of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the differences that you were able to see?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think definitely some can be attributed
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you happen to have somebody who is,
you know, cares enough to maybe send their
[SPEAKER_01]: product out for analysis, then the
challenge is going to be that you,
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab is probably not going to be able
to analyze for all of these analogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we don't think the labs are
actually, the manufacturer is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: sending these products out.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a real analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're, you know, they're
manufacturing the certificates of
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one product we received where,
you know, because not only are we getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the products, we also go to the websites
to see what's being said about these
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds and these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have one product in which the
website literally says, guaranteed these
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds are in this product,
but because the labs can't analyze it,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't tell you how much is in there,
but we promise it's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, it wasn't, there was a bunch of
other stuff in there, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, I mean, that's the landscape we live
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess with that sort of,
you know, what are the implications of
[SPEAKER_00]: these findings on sort of the,
the broader hemp industry or even for
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers, you know, what's sort of the
takeaway here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there are a couple of
implications here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and again, I mean, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably some hemp
manufacturers, CBD manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_01]: analog manufacturers, whatever they're
calling themselves, you know, who might
[SPEAKER_01]: care and, and have the intention of
creating these products for consumers who
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have access to Delta 9 THC in their
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are still complicit in the
adverse events that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an industry that is so far not
been held accountable for people dying,
[SPEAKER_01]: for people having significant adverse
events that have affected their lives for
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I think that's some of the
problem with, you know, the, the lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: oversight and, and of course, some of that
isn't, it's an analytical problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's not many labs that can
actually analyze these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it complicates from a state
perspective and even the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, I think it complicates the,
the state of legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, because most of the adverse
events are not being adequately
[SPEAKER_01]: attributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know if the product they
consumed was just 10 times the THC
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration or contains seven or eight
analogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know that, but usually what gets
reported is that it was a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: product or it was a THC product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and so when an adverse
event gets attached to, well, it was a THC
[SPEAKER_01]: product, you know, then that becomes
difficult language to ignore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to, we need to be able to,
from a public health and public safety
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, be able to properly attribute
the adverse events.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, those are a couple
of the bigger impacts of having an
[SPEAKER_01]: unregulated hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is sort of another side of
sort of the hemp industry too,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there are some manufacturers I know
who are producing not analogs or
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-synthetic, but, you know,
THC, Delta-9 THC, but in what they
[SPEAKER_00]: interpret as a low enough concentration to
be deemed hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, we've analyzed some of those
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in almost 100% of the products we've
analyzed, they contain over that 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a consumer to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's buyer beware, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the first thing is, is,
is the consumer has to realize that if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, if they are purchasing a product in
an unregulated market, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning that you are buying it at a smoke
and vape shop or right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Online.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are in a convenience store,
that just because it's in the marketplace
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean that it's safe, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, we as a culture believe that,
well, surely if it's in the, if it's in a
[SPEAKER_01]: store and I can buy it in a store,
then somebody has said, this is safe and
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonable for me to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they don't really appreciate the
difference between the unregulated and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated marketplaces necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that for all consumers is
that you should, despite the taxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase your products in a regulated
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is the safest path forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get it that some people have said,
well, we don't want to pay the taxes and
[SPEAKER_01]: the taxes are too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just read a scientifically published
manuscript recently that said that,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, consumers really don't care about
the high price.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about how much product they can
buy for a price point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very important distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So needless to say, I think that it is
important for consumers to be very
[SPEAKER_01]: cautious about what they're hearing about
all of these analogs and the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: the products and the safest place for them
to purchase their products is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of the regulated market despite
some of the challenges in the regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where that's available, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in states that don't have a legal
regulated marketplace, it's hard for the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or has hurdles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, how hard is it going to be for
some people to actually get their note
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that they can have medical
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think states have to think about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they really care about consumer safety,
then they have to make it easier for
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers to acquire regulated products.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems like, and of course,
this might be a bit optimistic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if cannabis were federally legal and
regulated, seems like a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're not, I'll be honest,
they're not really all going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get asked this question a lot in terms
of, and from a lot of state legislators is
[SPEAKER_01]: like, well, if we, if we create a
regulated marketplace, then all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff is going to disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, it is never completely going to go
away because there's always going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace for people looking for
alternative experiences, no matter what
[SPEAKER_01]: the drug is.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so this is, I think some of the
challenge will it, it won't all go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot will go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, you've got a lot of
consumers, whether they're cannabis naive
[SPEAKER_01]: or in pain or whatever who, or just want
to experience it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and they're, and, and so just for
those kinds of consumers, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to create a pathway for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think for the nefarious,
the really nefarious types, there's always
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Michelle, this is a, this is a
fascinating topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could, we could probably do a
whole nother hour, but we'll, we'll save
[SPEAKER_00]: it for CanMed and folks should definitely
come out and continue the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I let you go, I did want to
give you an opportunity to share any
[SPEAKER_00]: additional resources that you think that
folks who are listening, who want to maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: read up more might be interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, where they can find
you and your work as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, so we're building out a webpage
for the lab that's going to have links to
[SPEAKER_01]: our manuscripts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also developing some documents,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of like school
administrators, like, don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, they don't know, and they're trying
to protect the children in their
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're generating products,
like reading materials, one page reports
[SPEAKER_01]: that are easy to digest with that
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to share with you the link to
that and links to the manuscripts that
[SPEAKER_01]: people might be interested in reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send the links.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put them in the show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easy for folks who are listening
to check that out.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Michelle, thanks again for
joining me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to seeing you down in
Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
