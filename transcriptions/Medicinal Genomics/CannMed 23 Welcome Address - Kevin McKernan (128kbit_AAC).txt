[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone's well hydrated after last
night's dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seemed to be, I think I lost five pounds
on that, but I'm Kevin McKernan,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hosting this conference,
I can't remember how long, maybe six
[SPEAKER_00]: years, but I do want to spend some time
today dwelling on this concept of welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's imperative in science right now,
as we reflect on the welcoming of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed, everyone is welcome here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an exceptional diversity of
international attendees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank you for traveling as far as you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really does make it a better
conference when we have opinions from all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are officially now post-pandemic,
I think as of last week, which is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: refreshing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can think of no better place to
kick this off than at the former hotel
[SPEAKER_00]: where we had planned the Human Genome
Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of you may not be aware,
but this is a conference that was held for
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 20 years on these beaches and in
these hallways where we had planned out
[SPEAKER_00]: and mapped out how to sequence the Human
Genome Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a conference known as AGBT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the names like Francis Collins
and Kerry Mullis, Eric Lander,
[SPEAKER_00]: John Sulston, Bob Waterston, and sometimes
Craig Venter was allowed to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would hash out how we were going to
tackle the Genome Project here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much of the next generation sequencing
revolution that occurred was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: mapped out down there at Quinn's Beach
Bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of history here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important history because
I think we're embarking on a very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: scale of a project here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really like a human cannabinoid
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so much to learn about what's
going on with hundreds if not thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds and how these things can
potentially interact with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different receptors we're finding the
activity with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you think this pandemic is over
or not, we welcome you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether you think masks work,
ivermectin works, hydroxychloroquine
[SPEAKER_00]: works, vaccines work, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: We welcome you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want all of these diverse ideas here to
be discussed because they are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This controversy is something I think we
should embrace, investigate as we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: aware how politics can distort the
scientific consensus on any given topic
[SPEAKER_00]: and how long that has taken to reverse on
the topic of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we care about here at CanMed is just
open and in-person dialogues over very
[SPEAKER_00]: nuanced topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know the brighter future lies is
with people with different scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: views meeting in person, communicating,
brainstorming, and collaborating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can sense the dimmer future is
going to be is one of an algorithmically
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled Zoom meeting, LinkedIn,
Facebook, YouTube, all of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we know can have third parties that
can be influenced, censored, and if not,
[SPEAKER_00]: completely distorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these social media platforms can
certainly connect us, they can just as
[SPEAKER_00]: easily isolate us into different factions
ever arguing over small details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if many of you can remember
the history in the cannabis field,
[SPEAKER_00]: if William Randolph Hearst were alive
today, he'd probably own a social media
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regardless of whether you think Elon
Musk is going to handle these powers
[SPEAKER_00]: better or worse, I think everyone here can
agree that it's very dangerous for
[SPEAKER_00]: governments to launder First Amendment
violations or journalistic censorship
[SPEAKER_00]: through the companies they regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can manufacture consent for war
outside our borders, they can easily
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture this to civil discourse inside
our own borders with these types of new
[SPEAKER_00]: tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't have them camouflaging
dictates a scientific consensus and
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise science will become nothing more
than this marketing message or political
[SPEAKER_00]: campaign slogan, ever more political
intrusions into our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important that we give this
tremendous scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives them a tremendous amount of
narrative control and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is uniquely aware of how long
that type of narrative control can take to
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you some sense of the last
few years, when the entire world focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on one problem and often comes at the
expense of a more sound allocation of
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, we have seen addictions and
overdoses go through the roof in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: few years, and it's something the cannabis
community knows how to chip in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at in PubMed, in SARS-CoV-2,
there's over 200,000 publications for
[SPEAKER_00]: SARS-CoV-2 since 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only 32,000 publications for
cannabis since 1840.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a tremendous torrent of
information that you can choose your own
[SPEAKER_00]: adventure view through, frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this much information comes raging
through into NCBI and to PubMed,
[SPEAKER_00]: no one has read 100% of the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can walk your way through the COVID
literature and be 100% right with the
[SPEAKER_00]: position that you have and someone else
can go through that same literature on a
[SPEAKER_00]: different path and be 100% right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we're gonna resolve these
differences is in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's gonna happen through
Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we very much cherish people coming to
scientific conferences like this to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss an idea bridge and bring these
things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally feel we're witnessing a
scientific schism right now, very
[SPEAKER_00]: analogous to the Gutenberg printing press
and the Protestant Revolution or
[SPEAKER_00]: Reformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mainly around this pandemic,
we have very divided opinions on what to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with a situation like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the printing press was power,
and people tried to centralize that power.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best antidote to this
temptation is to further decentralize
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CanMed is just one node on that
network of scientists and physicians
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to pursue truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more that we can disintermediate
third parties that regulate our speech,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better we can be, I think,
at invention and in figuring out what we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do with the ECS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the world needs us right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now seeing more evidence of the
importance of the ECS in treating COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're well aware of many of the
comorbidities in treating COVID having
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid links, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen COPD as being a major
comorbidity, and we know that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil activity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer, thrombosis, there's a host of
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could treat the comorbidities,
we could probably knock the pandemic off
[SPEAKER_00]: the map at day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we stand here today, Ireland is
advocating medical misinformation laws
[SPEAKER_00]: under the guise of eliminating hate
speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have similar things going on in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you a few cases, and you don't
have to agree with these physicians,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can perhaps sympathize with how
their position could become you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sukrit Bhakdi is being tried next week
in Germany for speaking out about the
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic and their guising this in the
terms of hate speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Thomas Binder, who was actually
committed to a psych ward and forced to
[SPEAKER_00]: take psychiatric medicine because of his
position on an ivermectin or
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxychloroquine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which one he spoke out about,
but this is in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a physician in internal medicine
practicing for 24 years and had a
[SPEAKER_00]: doctorate in immunology and virology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think his voice was probably worth
hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may disagree with what these
physicians have said, but I hope that you
[SPEAKER_00]: reflect that this persecution can easily
be turned on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis field does not have a
consensus, at least not in the mainstream
[SPEAKER_00]: arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is quite often stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, these physicians here are
saving lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something I hope we can all
take some reflection on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are a group of scientists and
physicians that have also seen this movie
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the importance of
outside-of-the-box thinking in medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth isn't going to be declared from on
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's generated spontaneously with diverse
ideas and with people interacting,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make CanMed that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Marco Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I have the great honor of
introducing to you a person who has
[SPEAKER_00]: committed his career to reversing
inaccurate information about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
