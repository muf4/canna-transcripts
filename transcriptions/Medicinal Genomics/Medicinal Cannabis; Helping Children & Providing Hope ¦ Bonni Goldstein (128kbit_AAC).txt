[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Bonnie Goldstein and I'm a
licensed physician in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California and I have a medical practice
called Kanna Centers and what we do is
[SPEAKER_00]: educate and help patients use medical
cannabis for their serious and chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: My talk at CanMed is going to be about my
medical practice in terms of what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing with patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall what I'm seeing with chronic
pain patients, what I'm seeing with cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, what I'm seeing in the pediatric
epilepsy population that I'm taking care
[SPEAKER_00]: of, sharing those stories and talking
about how patients are using this to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the quality of their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed is a really important conference
and one is because it really does target
[SPEAKER_00]: the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get the best scientists,
they get doctors, they get researchers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get people who are maybe in other
fields who now have crossed over and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's passionate and everybody's
sharing ideas and it's all with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: goal is to help our fellow mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the parents that come to see me
are really nervous and once they start
[SPEAKER_00]: using it they say oh well wow this is
really working and you know they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of anxiety because they've been
through so many different things already
[SPEAKER_00]: and so many of them aren't trusting and
they're afraid to hope and all they need
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is to see that there is something
there and then they just say oh okay now I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to tell everybody about this because
why should anybody else be suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little girl that kind of comes
to mind who came to see me who has
[SPEAKER_00]: numerous medical issues and including
seizures and she tried multiple different
[SPEAKER_00]: medications and although some of them
worked to reduce the seizures all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: had terrible side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started her on cannabis oil and she
was able to wean off those medications and
[SPEAKER_00]: she came to see me when she was about
seven or eight years old and she wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: able to read or write and by ten she was
reading and writing and having much less
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures and I just feel really lucky as a
doctor to actually be able to help people
[SPEAKER_00]: truly feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this were to go away people would use
it off the black market and it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: unregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are people in states
where they don't have medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using it because their child is
sick and their child is better on it who
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't do that for their child.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have met people at conferences who came
because they're curious but they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: doubtful and then they start to listen and
they hear a doctor from a prestigious
[SPEAKER_00]: university speak about their research and
then they hear a someone from another
[SPEAKER_00]: country who's allowed to do research for
instance Dr. Meshulam from Israel came to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak about his experience last year and
then they hear from me about my patient
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences and they say well there is
something to this and that starts them on
[SPEAKER_00]: the journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: you
