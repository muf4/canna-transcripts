[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_02]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, big news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just last week, we announced details about
CanMed 23.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you signed up for email alerts,
at CanMedEvents.com, then you were among
[SPEAKER_02]: the first to be notified.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't signed up yet, be sure to
do that now because there will be a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more announcements between now and next
May.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: CanMed 23 will take place May 15th through
17th at Marco Island, Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: And CanMed 23 is going to be different
from all previous CanMed events in a few
[SPEAKER_02]: very important ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, the name is a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's now the CanMed 23 Innovation and
Investment Summit, which highlights both
[SPEAKER_02]: the nature of the breakthroughs being
presented at the event and the inclusion
[SPEAKER_02]: of principles to fund those efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, CanMed 23 will be held at the
Marriott Resort in Marco Island,
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will give attendees like you the
chance to fit in a little R&R at one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the most beautiful vacation venues in the
world with amenities like world-class
[SPEAKER_02]: golf, tennis, yoga, massages on the beach,
and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third, the summit will feature immersive
workshops to bring you up to speed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: latest in capital markets, medical
training, and deep dives into cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: and laboratory technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, although CanMed 23 will be different
in these ways, some things will stay the
[SPEAKER_02]: same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will still feature world-class oral
presentations in the areas of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing, curated by our CanMed
[SPEAKER_02]: advisory board for impact and importance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will continue to share that
knowledge with the cannabis community via
[SPEAKER_02]: our CanMed archive, social media
platforms, and of course, the CanMed
[SPEAKER_02]: Coffee Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you can't join us in Marco
Island, you can still be part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: CanMed community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Head over to canmedevents.com today to see
our updated website and learn more about
[SPEAKER_02]: the CanMed 23 event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode, I spoke with Dr. Jeff Chen
about conducting clinical trials on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Chen is the co-founder and CEO of
Radical Science, a health tech company
[SPEAKER_02]: generating history's first data set and AI
to prove and predict the effects of health
[SPEAKER_02]: and wellness products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Previously, he was the founder and
executive director at the UCLA Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Research Initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: At CanMed 2022, Dr. Chen presented results
from Radical Science's ACEs study,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was a randomized clinical trial
involving 13 CBD products and 3,000
[SPEAKER_02]: participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The project was possible thanks to Radical
Science's unique virtual approach to
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trials, which removes many of the
challenges that make them expensive and
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to conduct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Topics covered during the conversation
include the many challenges associated
[SPEAKER_02]: with performing clinical trials on
cannabinoids, how a virtual
[SPEAKER_02]: direct-to-consumer approach overcomes many
of these challenges, the value brands
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturers and distributors get from
clinical trial data, results from the ACEs
[SPEAKER_02]: study, the largest randomized CBD clinical
trial in history, how Radical applied
[SPEAKER_02]: lessons from the ACEs study to design the
Radical Spectrum study, and other minor
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids that Radical Science is
investigating in which have the most
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutic potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation with Dr.
Jeff, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, Planetary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Female-founded Planetary is truly
plant-based wellness designed to keep you
[SPEAKER_02]: moving and playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Planetary created a water-based hemp
extraction method and built a vertically
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated company with USDA organic
certified products made from full spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: stable CBDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer for plant-based
anti-inflammation is found in nature,
[SPEAKER_02]: beautifully harnessed with science.
[SPEAKER_02]: To learn more, visit Planetary.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's P-L-A-N-E-T-A-R-I-E dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Jeff
[SPEAKER_02]: Chen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Dr. Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excited for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm excited too because we're
talking today about a very important topic
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had Professor Matrulam on the podcast a
little while back and he was very
[SPEAKER_02]: passionate about the need for more
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, anecdotal evidence is great,
individual case studies are useful,
[SPEAKER_02]: but clinical trials are the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need good data to silence those who are
opposing cannabinoid medicine and claim
[SPEAKER_02]: that there isn't enough data to show
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that your group at Radical
Science is approaching clinical trials in
[SPEAKER_02]: a new way and I encourage people to check
out your CanMed 2022 presentation in our
[SPEAKER_02]: archive on canmedevents.com to learn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to start, I'm hoping you can explain
why is it so difficult to perform good
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trials on cannabinoid medicines?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the first thing to realize is
clinical trials in general, regardless of
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're studying, are already
gargantuan undertakings and you're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about high cost, extreme complexity,
and also a very slow speed to completion.
[SPEAKER_03]: A clinical trial can easily run millions
of dollars requires a team of very
[SPEAKER_03]: talented scientists and physicians and can
easily take years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as soon as you understand that about
clinical trials, then instantly you
[SPEAKER_03]: already see why it's a barrier to any sort
of compound or product that say isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: backed by a large pharma company that has
the resources, wherewithal, and more
[SPEAKER_03]: importantly the experience to navigate a
clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the first thing to understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this might be a conversation for a
separate time as to why they're so
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive and slow, but a lot of it's,
they're bureaucratic.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of regulations around the
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Expensive personnel are involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, high level scientists, PhDs,
doctors, they often involve clinical trial
[SPEAKER_03]: sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you have expensive medical
facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: The experience for people in the clinical
trial is suboptimal to say the least.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you have to pay them incentives to
put up with all the inconvenience and take
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially scary, you know, experimental
drugs, all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's zooming in on cannabinoids
specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes clinical trials difficult on
cannabinoids all focus on the US,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a lot of these also parallel other
places around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing is the regulatory
classification of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to THC, it's a controlled
substance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if a researcher wants to research
THC, they need to go get special DEA
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even after obtaining those DEA
licenses, they can only purchase those
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled cannabinoids from other people
who have a DEA license to manufacture
[SPEAKER_03]: those controlled cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to cannabis, THC containing
cannabis, for the last 50 years,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was only one entity that had that
DEA license.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the University of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the last, you know, six to 12 months,
a handful of other entities have been
[SPEAKER_03]: granted those licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the difficulty.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a researcher, I got to go through all
these extra hoops to get that license.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I have the license from the DEA,
I'm very limited into who I can buy those
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled substance cannabinoids from.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to store them a certain way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to install security systems,
even though there might be a cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: dispenser across the street where anyone
over the age of 21 can walk in and buy
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have to treat this like how the
federal government defines it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to other cannabinoids,
things like CBD, research is difficult for
[SPEAKER_03]: a different reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it comes to CBD, the FDA is
saying, okay, CBD, while it might not be a
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled substance anymore after the
2018 farm bill, we now consider it a drug,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a pharmaceutical drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because Epidiolex is basically a
CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's FDA approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So CBD isn't a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to research CBD, you need to
go through an investigational new drug
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that process is both onerous for the
researcher and onerous for the company
[SPEAKER_03]: supplying the product to go into the
study.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was classified as just a dietary
supplement study, it's so much easier for
[SPEAKER_03]: the producer of the product to get the
product up to spec for the study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so much less cumbersome for the
researcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as the product has to undergo
the research as an investigational new
[SPEAKER_03]: drug, it makes it very difficult,
if not nearly impossible, for a vast
[SPEAKER_03]: majority of, in this case, CBD providers
to have their product classified and be
[SPEAKER_03]: registered with the FDA as an acceptable
investigational new drug and in place as a
[SPEAKER_03]: much more cumbersome process on the
researcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do see this in other countries as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason that Canada legalized
cannabis and cannabinoids medically 10
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many rigorous clinical trials have you
seen come out of Canada on any
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because they still need special
licenses from the government to research
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the cannabinoids they can
research have to then go through this more
[SPEAKER_03]: stricter process than, say, a herbal study
or dietary supplement study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like a weird catch-22 or
chicken in the egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know which metaphor fits here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the government is saying that we need
more data before we can make this a
[SPEAKER_02]: non-controlled substance or open it up for
more research or legalize it medically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're also making it difficult to do
any of this research in order to classify
[SPEAKER_02]: it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there have been attempts to change
laws to make the process easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen too much traction on that
end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there have been bills presented in
front of Congress to try and change
[SPEAKER_03]: elements of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even if you can solve the unique
restrictions and difficulties that
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids face, until you fundamentally
solve the complexities and the high cost
[SPEAKER_03]: and the slow speed of trials, you're still
not going to get the data you need on any
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of acceptable time scale and on any
sort of acceptable rigor and volume of
[SPEAKER_03]: data to allow people to make enough
decisions, appropriate decisions on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's tens of millions of Americans
using cannabinoids every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the current pace of research
studies, we might not have data for a
[SPEAKER_03]: decade or more to appropriately inform who
should use what type and what dosage for
[SPEAKER_03]: what use case, who should avoid what type
and what dosage if they have other
[SPEAKER_03]: existing issues, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need a new approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you guys are doing at
Radical Science.
[SPEAKER_02]: So explain how you guys are approaching
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Radical Science, we imagine clinical
trials from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first area that we wanted to start was
to ensure that we're not trapped by many
[SPEAKER_03]: of the same federal funding restrictions
that universities are trapped by.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is why universities,
even state public universities,
[SPEAKER_03]: in states where cannabis is legal,
they still can only follow federal rules,
[SPEAKER_03]: study federally regulated cannabinoids in
a federally compliant fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because they take federal funding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost all universities take federal
funding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instantly you're eliminating the option
for them to study things that tens of
[SPEAKER_03]: millions of Americans are using every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we avoid federal funding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't take federal grants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of that, we have a lot more
flexibility in studying things like CBD,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, without an investigational
new drug process or studying other
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids from hemp, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we wanted to address the high cost
and the slow speed of clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to do that, we adopted a virtual
direct-to-consumer trial process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the virtualization of it,
we can eliminate all that expensive
[SPEAKER_03]: infrastructure, the hospitals,
the clinics, the fancy buildings that many
[SPEAKER_03]: universities like to spend money on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We go completely virtual.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we go direct-to-consumer,
the data capture is directly from
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a nurse or a doctor or a
research staff having to interview every
[SPEAKER_03]: single person in the study, hand them a
paper survey, collect their responses,
[SPEAKER_03]: then upload that paper survey into a
computer, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm collecting data from them directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've removed the intermediaries and
expensive intermediaries, expensive
[SPEAKER_03]: personnel that are driving up the cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, streamlining a lot of the
operational aspects of clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_03]: automating them with technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another key innovation that we've
done as well at Radical Science.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, we're vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't hire some other firm to do our
recruitment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't hire some other firm to do our
analysis and report generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do everything in-house from the design
of the studies to the powering of the
[SPEAKER_03]: studies to the technology stack that
collects data and manages and oversees the
[SPEAKER_03]: studies to the analysis, the reporting,
everything we do end-to-end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how we can also drive
additional cost and speed improvements to
[SPEAKER_03]: our clients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one other key innovation at Radical
Science is that we're running template
[SPEAKER_03]: studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we like to say that we've done for
clinical trials what Ford Motors did for
[SPEAKER_03]: automobiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 100 years ago, before Ford came along,
you could get a car.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just made to order, customized,
and hand-built by a team of guys for a
[SPEAKER_03]: year or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was only available to the 0.01%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Ford came along and said,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to build the Model T.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a template car.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to have four doors,
four wheels, and this type of engine.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't like that, you can go order
your hand-built car.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the 99% of people that this is
good enough and this is appropriate,
[SPEAKER_03]: great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've done that for clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we don't do custom studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a custom study to come to us,
we say, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go find one of 1,000 universities
and CROs do that custom study for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want a template study that's 10
times cheaper and faster and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in one of the template studies
we offer, pain, anxiety, mood,
[SPEAKER_03]: sleep, energy, cognition, fatigue,
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can turn this around in a way that's
never been done before and help you drive
[SPEAKER_03]: the R&D that you need, help you
substantiate the claims that you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: your stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that analogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do these templates look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how would they differ from a clinical
trial that's done in a university?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, not including the
things you talked about with it being
[SPEAKER_02]: virtual and all that, but just the study
itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: These studies are actually designed in
collaboration with university researchers
[SPEAKER_03]: and professors.
[SPEAKER_03]: They consult with us in an individual
capacity because oftentimes they're
[SPEAKER_03]: frustrated with the fact that it's
basically impossible to do these same
[SPEAKER_03]: studies at the universities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what these professors love to do at
any one academia, they love to think,
[SPEAKER_03]: they love to be creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: They love to analyze data.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they don't love to do is redundant
bureaucratic operations and paperwork,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is now driving, you know,
that's kind of like the hallmark of these
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical trials now in these university
environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so fundamentally, the design,
the rationale, the controls we put in
[SPEAKER_03]: place to eliminate bias, they are no
different than gold standard clinical
[SPEAKER_03]: trials run at universities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, at Radical Science,
we're running blinded randomized placebo
[SPEAKER_03]: control trials at large scale using
validated outcome measures and analyzing
[SPEAKER_03]: them using kind of gold standard
approaches to biostatistics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from that standpoint, the studies are
the same caliber.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just we've been able to do them in a
process direct to consumer, virtual,
[SPEAKER_03]: automated, streamlined to lower the cost
and improve the speed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with this template approach,
we furthermore save time.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you call Radical Science,
I don't need to spend six months thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: of a study, designing it, powering it,
building in our tech stack, and then going
[SPEAKER_03]: out to run it and being like, whoops,
I didn't foresee XYZ issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's delayed now, but the data is not as
great as it could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already run this study 27 times.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the 28th time I'm running it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sign the contract.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no anticipated delays.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no unexpected mistakes that are
going to come about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a factory line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you buy a Toyota Camry,
it's going to work a lot better than when
[SPEAKER_03]: you buy some dude's hand-built hot rod in
his garage and he's driving it for the
[SPEAKER_03]: first time to your house to deliver it to
you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and I would imagine having that
template approach too and make it easier
[SPEAKER_02]: to compare one study to another.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the long run, that's theoretically
possible, although that's not really an
[SPEAKER_03]: intended goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's theoretically possible in
the long run.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also keep in mind with our studies,
the data is all confidential to the brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the goal here is not to show one
company is or is not better.
[SPEAKER_03]: With their approval, then yes,
the template nature does allow you to look
[SPEAKER_03]: between the studies somewhat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ASA study, for example,
was one where all the brands specifically
[SPEAKER_03]: opted in to this aggregate kind of
comparison across all of their products.
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, the data, both the identity
of the brands we work with and their
[SPEAKER_03]: specific study data, it's all confidential
to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only talk about it if they give us
permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess that's a good question too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the answer is probably obvious,
but what is the benefit of having this
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trial data for the brands
themselves?
[SPEAKER_02]: What can they do with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what does that enable them to do that
they wouldn't be able to do otherwise?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would say there's many different
reasons that brands have come to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it's not just the brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's the ingredient suppliers
that have come to us to do studies,
[SPEAKER_03]: hoping that they can prove that their
ingredients actually work and therefore
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not a commodity.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can sell more of it, sell it at a
premium price compared to other people
[SPEAKER_03]: that don't have that data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or for some of these minor cannabinoids,
generate the first ever data of human
[SPEAKER_03]: effectiveness and basically create the
market and demand for that cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the ingredient supplier or that
distributor or the manufacturer of that
[SPEAKER_03]: product can benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also the downstream brands who
also engage us too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the range of options are it's
everything from substantiating claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a major one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This ingredient or this branded product is
clinically shown, clinically proven,
[SPEAKER_03]: validated, demonstrated to improve XYZ,
to do XYZ.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't make disease claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not curing insomnia.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are improving sleep quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where you don't invoke the
FDA's position that this is a drug making
[SPEAKER_03]: a disease claim.
[SPEAKER_03]: So claim substantiation is a major one.
[SPEAKER_03]: R&D is another major one too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've run studies that are as large as
several thousand people where the company
[SPEAKER_03]: is comparing up to, for instance,
eight different formulations head to head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wanting to understand which one would be
best to take to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're talking about an R&D process
that for, and this is not cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: specific, any sort of consumer health
product, their R&D is often like,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's come up theoretically with a
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: We give it to a few dozen friends and
family, get some anecdotal feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feedback looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: My aunt says it looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's go make a multi-million dollar
business launch decision on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though there's a very fair chance it
could be a placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So R&D is a big piece of this system.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then other areas, I think brands also
realize that having this data is valuable
[SPEAKER_03]: for them to go raise money from skeptical
investors who see them at like every other
[SPEAKER_03]: company out there hawking a supplement or
hawking some consumer health product,
[SPEAKER_03]: dramatically raises evaluation,
dramatically gets trust from investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a similar vein, people who are
trying to get distribution or retail,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you're one of 1400 Ashwagandha
brands that I've talked to in the last 30
[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes you different?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, we have clinical trial data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can know that you're exposing your
customers to a product that's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, our product can make
claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll fly off your shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those conversations become
possibilities as well with the right data.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now in order to make those claims,
does that data need to be public
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have to publish it either on their
website or in a journal or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to make structure function claims,
you do have to publish the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: But publishing is a very broad sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just needs to be accessible by the
public.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could be a white paper that sits on
your website.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be all the way to peer review
publication as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some brands, after the study is ready,
they're happy just to release it as a
[SPEAKER_03]: white paper on their website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other ones want a peer review publication
for an extra layer of credibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have services where we'll help them
and submit those papers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned the ACEs study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was hoping you could talk a little
bit more about that, because that was a
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty important study, a pretty large
study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the ACEs study was the first study that
we attempted as a company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we launched it about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time, our company was pretty small
and pretty young.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's pretty impressive and
speaks on my team that we decided,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, we're a company that's six months
old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just do the largest CBD clinical
trial ever done in history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's get it done in six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the goal we set for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had 14 brands join us in the ACEs
study.
[SPEAKER_03]: It involved nearly 3,000 Americans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was a study that was specifically
intended to collect real world data on the
[SPEAKER_03]: usage and outcomes that CBD products might
be providing to the tens of millions of
[SPEAKER_03]: Americans using it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in order to maintain the real world
lens of the study, we decided to make it
[SPEAKER_03]: an open label study.
[SPEAKER_03]: What open label means that people got the
product in a form that was not blinded.
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew what they were taking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this case, we wanted the companies
to submit products in their natural form
[SPEAKER_03]: that was already being sold on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, to mimic the experience of someone
going on Amazon or walking to a store
[SPEAKER_03]: buying a CBD product.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes in something that's nice and
labeled, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They know the company behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all these things were meant to mimic
the real world outcomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore, for us to be best able to
approximate those outcomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we ran the study.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran it for a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got nearly 3,000 Americans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Americans were assigned to one of
the CBD products, which they got in the
[SPEAKER_03]: mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they were assigned to be in a control
arm where they did not receive any CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we continue to track their pain,
their anxiety, their sleep, their
[SPEAKER_03]: well-being, and their quality of life,
just to understand how it might change
[SPEAKER_03]: over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That control allows us to control for the
natural progression of these conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm anxious today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And without any intervention, what happens
to my anxiety four weeks from now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it gets worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it gets better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it stays the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also allowed us to control for macro
environment instances.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for instance, if I was living in
Ukraine four months ago and you see my
[SPEAKER_03]: anxiety spike, if I have a weightless
control group, I can be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's probably because the Russians
invaded, anxiety spiked across the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can now control and factor that in.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I look at these people on the CBD and
I go, now why is their anxiety getting
[SPEAKER_03]: worse?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A war broke out because I can look at the
control group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was important for us to have that
control group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we found was, and we wanted
products that have a variety of different
[SPEAKER_03]: form factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had soft gels and gummies and tinctures
and sprays and dissolving tablets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had different spectrums.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had isolate, full and broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had different dosages too,
again, just to get a huge representation
[SPEAKER_03]: of all the products out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we analyzed the data,
we found a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we found that there were significant
improvements across the board for anxiety,
[SPEAKER_03]: sleep and pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anxiety had the largest improvements
followed by sleep and followed by pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also found that the largest
improvements tended to happen within the
[SPEAKER_03]: first week or two of using the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then by weeks three and four,
there were still improvements happening,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they were at a much more reduced pace.
[SPEAKER_03]: So think of it as like, if this is showing
the improvement in their wellbeing,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, you see in the first week or
two, and then you still see it kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I realized I was just gesturing by
hands as the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see a sharper increase in the first
week or two, and then a more still
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing, but more gradually sloped off
increase in the latter half of the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did some other interesting things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at males and females,
and we found that that didn't impact the
[SPEAKER_03]: experience of the outcomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also looked at whether people were
naive, moderate or experienced CBD users.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did not find that that predicted a
difference in their health outcomes from
[SPEAKER_03]: taking CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also looked at age groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also found that that wasn't a
predictor of effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to recap, it seems that gender or
moreover sex assigned at birth,
[SPEAKER_03]: age group and experience with CBD weren't
predictive of whether someone was gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: have a good or bad result or improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also analyzed the data set by spectrum
and by dose of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we found was that for spectrum,
we did not find a significant difference
[SPEAKER_03]: by spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I'll caveat that in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it came to CBD dose, we did not
find a predictable relationship that a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain amount of CBD was necessarily
better than another amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at, that's not to say that
spectrum doesn't matter, and that all CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: doses are the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: More likely what's happened is that there
was so much diversity in the products that
[SPEAKER_03]: the products differed in multiple
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really hard for us to control
for just spectrum or just dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried our best, but I believe there
still needs to be many studies to dig into
[SPEAKER_03]: this notion of what's the proper spectrum,
what's the proper dosage.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually why we decided to launch
these subsequent studies on CBD to fill in
[SPEAKER_03]: these missing gaps in the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, to recap, this is a pretty
monumental study, largest CBD trial in
[SPEAKER_03]: history.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a control arm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We enrolled nearly 3,000 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found that things like gender and age
and experience with CBD weren't predictive
[SPEAKER_03]: for health outcomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found that across the board,
there were significant improvements in
[SPEAKER_03]: anxiety, sleep and pain with anxiety
experiencing the most improvements
[SPEAKER_03]: followed by sleep, followed by pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also found that side effects were
rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very mild, about 10% of people in the
study reported any sort of side effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were all generally mild side
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in those results, was there anything
that stood out to you or that was
[SPEAKER_02]: surprising or that you didn't expect?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, going into the study,
I had expected things like experience with
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD to impact outcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also had potentially expected sex
assigned at birth to also impact outcome
[SPEAKER_03]: because we've seen from preclinical
studies that sex of male, female mice have
[SPEAKER_03]: differential experiences to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually gender differences or sex
differences are becoming more and more
[SPEAKER_03]: apparent across all sorts of health
outcome measures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was a little surprised to see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, this is an area where we
probably need many, many more studies in
[SPEAKER_03]: this realm to really confirm what we're
seeing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I forget who this court is attributed
to, but any good study warrants many,
[SPEAKER_03]: many more follow up studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just the first of blip on the
radar to give society a starting point
[SPEAKER_03]: with which they can layer on additional
studies on CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a great segue because you are
currently doing a follow up study,
[SPEAKER_02]: radical spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I imagine that you're applying some of
the lessons learned from ACEs.
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: So radical spectrum, you know,
in ACEs, we had some preliminary findings
[SPEAKER_03]: on dose and spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we knew that because these
products differed not just in one
[SPEAKER_03]: characteristic, some of these products
differed in form factor and dose and
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So radical spectrum is a study where every
company has to submit a minimum of three
[SPEAKER_03]: things to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to submit a placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to submit a CBD isolate and
they're going to submit a broad or full
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum product.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these three submissions have to
look identical, aka same bottle,
[SPEAKER_03]: same form factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the only thing that's differing is
the contents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the isolate and the broad full
spectrum have to be the same concentration
[SPEAKER_03]: of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only thing differing between them
is the other stuff, other cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is a three arm study with
which at the end of the study,
[SPEAKER_03]: the brand can have several things sitting
in their data set that could be useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can, first off, they can have proved
that their product works better than
[SPEAKER_03]: placebo for a variety of health outcome
measures, quality of life, pain,
[SPEAKER_03]: sleep, anxiety, mood.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could also potentially have proved
that their product works better than
[SPEAKER_03]: isolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at the reason why the FDA
says all these CBD supplements are illegal
[SPEAKER_03]: is because they resemble CBD isolate,
GW's Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this data might be some of the first
data ever to show that these supplements
[SPEAKER_03]: do not perform the same as a CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore you might not be able to
lump them with something like a Epidiolex
[SPEAKER_03]: from GW pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe perhaps they aren't subject to a
drug preclusion principle from the FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the study is nice for the brands in
that it allows them multiple things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it allows them to prove their
product works better than placebo,
[SPEAKER_03]: which for 99% of CBD brands, they don't
have those data sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can also prove that the product
potentially works better than isolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, the study allows them to
do a dose titration so they can explore
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple doses of their product and
simultaneously get multiple shots on goal
[SPEAKER_03]: for quality of life, pain, sleep,
anxiety, and mood.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For now, it's the last CBD study that
we're going to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still gonna run studies on other
hemp-derived cannabinoids, CBC,
[SPEAKER_03]: CBG, CBN, THCV, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the FDA is making it very difficult to
even research CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after this radical spectrum runs,
we're gonna table our CBD studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll still be taking studies on other
minor cannabinoids because the FDA has not
[SPEAKER_03]: said those are drugs, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And furthermore, we're going to,
we already have opened up our studies to
[SPEAKER_03]: non-cannabinoid supplements.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're running studies on functional
mushrooms and herbs and probiotics and the
[SPEAKER_03]: tropics and a bunch of other things
leveraging our newly developed disruptive
[SPEAKER_03]: trials platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first question, I take it based on the
way you were talking that the brands that
[SPEAKER_02]: are involved in the spectrum study,
they're all broad spectrum or full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then secondly, so is CBD, it's
difficult to study because of that drug
[SPEAKER_02]: designation that you talked about earlier
with Epidiolex?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the FDA has, like starting many years
ago, the FDA first started saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, you can't sell CBD as a supplement.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta get it approved as a drug before
you can sell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we are increasingly seeing that
even the research of CBD is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: require an investigation on new drug
process, which universities have been
[SPEAKER_03]: beholden to for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been able to do it thus far without
it, but going forward, we're not confident
[SPEAKER_03]: we will be able to continue these studies
without that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why CBD spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: The radical spectrum is our last study of
any of our studies that allows CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: products to be enrolled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So going forward, we don't really have
study slots or enrollment slots open to
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD products.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about CBDA?
[SPEAKER_03]: That gets a little, that could potentially
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, that could potentially work if
there's a way that you can stabilize the
[SPEAKER_03]: CBDA and show that it's not spontaneously
converting to significant quantities of
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, that could work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the radical spectrum is, will that
data be made public or is that going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: at the discretion of the brands?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be at the discretion of
the brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but you know, so far most,
if not all these brands have wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about their data because it helps,
you know, it helps the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps their own brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and before I let you go, because you
did bring it up, you're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: exploring some of these other minor
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested to know, I know that you
can only share so much, but what are you
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at in terms of, you know,
those cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which ones are you looking at and what
sort of conditions?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've already, we've already run
studies on CBC, CBG and CBN, either by
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves or in combinations with other
minor cannabinoids or in combinations with
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about to start launching a series of
studies on THCV.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of CBC, CBN and CBG, we've been
running studies on them for things like
[SPEAKER_03]: anxiety and pain and sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the upcoming THCV studies,
it's going to be focused on energy focus
[SPEAKER_03]: and appetite suppression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's subsequent studies as
well that are going to involve minor
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids for areas like quality of
life and mood and libido and things like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In which, in which of the minor
cannabinoids do you think is sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: next big minor cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, honestly, well, how do I say this?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all pretty interesting because
we're all starting from ground zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whatever people state to be true
or not true about minor cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least from human effectiveness data,
there's not really anything to go off of.
[SPEAKER_03]: There just haven't been studies to prove
or refute that any of these minor
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids could help certain things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're basically doing some of history's
first, not a sum up, we are doing
[SPEAKER_03]: history's first human effectiveness,
randomized, blind to placebo controlled
[SPEAKER_03]: trials to look at these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one thing that I think is really
interesting, just from a from the
[SPEAKER_03]: zeitgeist to the moment, everyone's
talking about how you can get better
[SPEAKER_03]: energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone wants to take nootropics,
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think THCV gets pretty interesting
where anecdotally you're hearing about
[SPEAKER_03]: these effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have human studies on THCV's ability
to improve blood sugar levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely is modulating metabolism.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I get really excited that we're
going to launch these studies to see how
[SPEAKER_03]: it can really help with potentially focus,
potentially with energy and potentially
[SPEAKER_03]: with appetite suppression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think about a lot of things
that Americans are grappling with right
[SPEAKER_03]: now, poor sleep, poor sleep and your
fatigue during the day, or you have
[SPEAKER_03]: fatigue or you have long COVID or you're
anxious and you can't focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact that THCV could potentially
help some of these areas based on some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the strong anecdotal data we're seeing,
that could really help improve a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people's lives who are having and
grappling with these issues and wanting
[SPEAKER_03]: better focus, wanting more energy and
potentially wanting to suppress their
[SPEAKER_03]: appetite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I fast every day for longevity
purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: For some people, that's not achievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And other people might need to fast more
because they have maybe gained some
[SPEAKER_03]: weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that excess weight is tied to
a whole host of deleterious health
[SPEAKER_03]: outcomes from increased risk of dementia
to cardiovascular events.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really hope that we'll see what the
studies show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're positive, these are tools
that could really help a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of potential there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Dr. Jeff, before I let you go,
I want to give you an opportunity to plug
[SPEAKER_02]: any websites, social media or additional
resources that the listeners could engage
[SPEAKER_02]: with or read up on to learn more about
what you guys are working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Radical Science, we're here
running disruptive direct-to-consumer
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: So non-prescription health products can
accelerate their R&D and substantiate
[SPEAKER_03]: their claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do it all 10 times cheaper and
faster than anything that's been done
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Radical is spelled R-I-D-I-C-L-E,
kind of like particle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that spelling of radical means the
root of a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we're getting to.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting to the root of these health
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting to the truth behind all of
these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's Radical Science.
