[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_01]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now officially three months away
from the CanMed 23 Innovation and
[SPEAKER_01]: Investment Summit, which takes place May
15th through 7th.
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Marriott Marco Island Beach Resort
in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me when I tell you, you do not
want to miss this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only will you get to learn from our
oral presenters, who have been curated by
[SPEAKER_01]: our esteemed advisory board, but we also
have four intensive professional
[SPEAKER_01]: development workshops planned covering
medical applications of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies for fighting plant pathogens,
laboratory compliance challenges,
[SPEAKER_01]: and investment in cannabinoid innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a number of networking events
planned, including beach dinners and open
[SPEAKER_01]: bar cocktail hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have received your invitation to
CanMed 23, register today to reserve your
[SPEAKER_01]: spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have not yet received an
invitation, go to canmedevents.com now to
[SPEAKER_01]: request one.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dr. Marcus Roggen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus is president and chief scientific
officer of Delac Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: A licensed cannabis and psilocybin
research laboratory focused on extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: optimization, analytical testing,
and process development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus has been in the cannabis industry
since 2014 and has held several executive
[SPEAKER_01]: positions in analytical and production
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: His research into process optimization and
analytical methods has been recognized
[SPEAKER_01]: with a number of awards and he has become
a trusted advisor and mentor to multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: startups startup accelerators and
organizations, including CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: At CanMed 23, Marcus will be presenting
the topic of birds, bees, and buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to talk about cannabis and how to
label it correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: During our conversation, we discuss some
of the issues with current cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: labeling, as well as some potential
alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: More specifically, we discuss how THC
percentage is miscalculated, the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: only a fraction of the THC in cannabis
flower is actually consumed, how joint
[SPEAKER_01]: architecture affects the amount of THC the
smoker consumes, why the ABV percentage in
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol and the THC percentage in cannabis
are not one in the same, and how
[SPEAKER_01]: establishing a standard unit of cannabis
products may shift the focus away from THC
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage and towards things like aroma,
terpene profiles, and flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Marcus, I'd like to thank this episode
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Juvalife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Founded by pioneers in the science and
business of cannabis and guided by a team

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus Roggen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast yet again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me yet again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a problem with cannabis
labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've written several articles on the
topic and you're going to be presenting
[SPEAKER_01]: about it at CanMed 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is wrong with the current way that we
label cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to come to the event in
Florida to hear all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here I will give you a quick summary
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I give away what is wrong with it,
except everything, let me explain where I
[SPEAKER_00]: come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came to the cannabis industry out of
university, just finished my postdoc in
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no personal background in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came to it new and fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I might have looked at things a
little different and that's why normally
[SPEAKER_00]: people would say, oh, that's the way it's
always been.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, why do you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started asking things with my
main research field of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where most of my work comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It then also dawned on me at some point
that the way cannabis is labeled is
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematically wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it started because you see
on flower labels that there is a total THC
[SPEAKER_00]: value or total CBD, but effectively every
cannabis cultivar nowadays is just pure
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And total THC is made up of the natural
produced THC acid that's in the flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: then THC that happens after
decarboxylation, which hasn't happened yet
[SPEAKER_00]: in the flower, but it's the compound you
get when you smoke and you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's an intoxicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of labeling, this is how much
THC is in, a THC acid is in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people want THC, people came up with a
total THC number because there's a weight
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between THC acid and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore they are correcting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was explaining this to my
fellow researchers, who really have no
[SPEAKER_00]: background in cannabis and just students
at the university here in British Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: at UBC, I stumbled over the point
realizing that the weight correction is
[SPEAKER_00]: done for the THC acid weight loss,
but not for the weight loss of the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's mathematically incorrect because
you're forgetting the denominator.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best example is if you take pure THC
acid crystal, like a pure THC acid
[SPEAKER_00]: crystal, you would normally think,
yeah, that's pure THC, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: THC acid THC is like, it's pure THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be therefore a hundred percent
THC or a hundred percent total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the mathematical formula,
it would be 87.7% total THC, which makes
[SPEAKER_00]: no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can a pure compound not be pure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Adonomi, you're forgetting this
denominator and you're not correcting for
[SPEAKER_00]: math.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wrote about this, but when I then
started thinking about this, does that
[SPEAKER_00]: have any influence?
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized the whole industry sells its
products based on one number, total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from total THC being mathematically
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find this as a scientist
interesting, but I think the general
[SPEAKER_00]: public thinks geek or nerd and moves on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general public should be interested in
the fact that cannabis is just sold as one
[SPEAKER_00]: number, as total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, that's what the customer want,
but that's also what we educated the
[SPEAKER_00]: customer about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a strong reason why that is
because THC is the main intoxicating
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like the first one we could
test for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw it, we made a number,
we bred for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focused everything on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take parallels to other
industries,
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol is not bored by the alcohol number
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the highest number of alcohol
is what you are after, then every time you
[SPEAKER_00]: go into a wine store to buy something,
you walk out with a bottle of vodka.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should all drink ever clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't drink any Budweiser or Habs Blue
Ribbon because German beer has more
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I generally can't understand why you
drink American beer, not German beer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this focus of total THC is preventing
the industry from building on its aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the intoxicating aspect of
cannabis, but then there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseur, the high quality,
the craft cannabis that everyone talks
[SPEAKER_00]: about, but then you only sell it as total
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my internal conflict that then
made me think about how could we correct
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you mentioned that it's just
the way that it's always been and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people might not be questioning
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be completely honest, I hadn't
actually really considered the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're reporting THC potency until I
started reading through what you've
[SPEAKER_01]: written, getting ready for this interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hadn't actually considered what that
percentage actually means.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you think about it in the
parallel to I think alcohol kind of drives
[SPEAKER_01]: this home, at least in my mind,
you could tell me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, alcohol by volume kind of
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's eight percent, then OK,
I'm going to drink this liquid and
[SPEAKER_01]: calculate what percent or what volume
actually of alcohol I'm ingesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it when you see THC percentage on
a flower, you're not just eating that
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, you're you're burning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're decarboxylating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of a different method of
ingestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that part of the problem as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, you know, that percent number
isn't actually telling you what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going to be consuming?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my own research lab so I can
actually test and measure things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the last few years, we are doing
smoke research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a robot that smokes a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put therefore a joint or a vape
cartridge to this robot and then capture
[SPEAKER_00]: what comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can measure puff per puff and for
the whole joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we recently did studies on seeing if
the particle size of a flower that you put
[SPEAKER_00]: into a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you if you break up a flower bud
into big chunks or really fine powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: chunks, does that make a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a difference in the inhalation of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a fine powder in your joint,
you inhale double the amount of THC for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first few puffs than you do for large
chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one millimeter versus five millimeter
particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and it's the same flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in addition, the small particle,
the joint burns quicker and then the large
[SPEAKER_00]: particle the burns slower and you get more
puffs out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, you inhale more THC for the
large chunks when you smoke the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just take one or two puffs,
then the small particle size is the right
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this notion, I buy a pre-roll joint
with 25% THC is better, better in air
[SPEAKER_00]: quotes because it gets me higher than a
19% THC joint is wrong because the
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particle size, packing density.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at water content and how
that affects it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having a percentage number for an
inhalable product that is burned doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really make much sense because it doesn't
directly correlate to how much you inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also side note, when you smoke a
joint, you maybe get 20% of all the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we say that a joint has a hundred
milligram of THC in that flower and you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it, you inhale 20 milligrams of THC
over the course of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest is destroyed, goes into the room,
sticks to the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't found every single milligram of
THC yet where it goes, but not all a
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial amount of the THC that's in
the cannabis joint doesn't make it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could also discuss if you
inhale it, does it actually reach your
[SPEAKER_00]: bloodstream?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a more biological question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the idea is that we had for
different ways of labeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we are talking about how to label
cannabis better, my position comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: having done the math, having done the
chemistry experiment, actually measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think I can speak from physical
authority saying the current way is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now if I understand correctly,
so if I have, you know, I have 25% flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I roll one gram joint with very fine
particles and another one with bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: chunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I consume both entirely, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In different sessions, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to get a different amount of
THC from one versus the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: just based on how the particles are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and that's just joints,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about, you know, if you're using a
bowl or a bong or a vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: are those all, you know, different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very likely, but we have so far only done
research on joints and vape cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun fact, a vape cartridge and a joint are
about the same amount of THC per puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that the nine... Depending on
the particle size though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are error bars on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are within the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you inhale one milligram for
a joint and 10 milligrams for a vape
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You inhale somewhere between half a
milligram to two milligrams in both cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the flower, the mill size,
the oil, the hardware, but it's somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that independent of what the THC
percentage is of the flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried different, we bought different
pre-rolls you can buy in the store and we
[SPEAKER_00]: made some from our own flower stock in the
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is, yes, there are factors of
one or two or three in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like half a milligram versus two
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we think in scientific terms,
we normally think in orders of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it one, 10, 100, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That size steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all within the one milligram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really that percentage difference that
you see in different products,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't really translate in terms of in
actuality.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and it's not an important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not directly correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that the 19% flower gives you
less of a buzz than the 25% flower because
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, joint architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under joint architecture, I go
particle size, packing density,
[SPEAKER_00]: water content, paper, mouthpiece,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also means that the around 20%
THC flower and the 90% cannabis oil from a
[SPEAKER_00]: vape cartridge still gives you the same
amount of THC per puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the politicians that say that
cannabis is getting too strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: they see, ooh, 90% vape cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the vape cards gives you the same
per puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, per puff, because if you smoke a
whole vape cart that has like 400 puffs on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, that is going to give you a big,
bigger buzz or a total amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that very, very few people
can smoke a whole vape cart in one
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they exist, but I would say there
are more people can smoke a whole joint
[SPEAKER_00]: than they can smoke a whole vape cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what about the whole idea that at
least anecdotally people who may have used
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis back in college or high school,
and now they're coming back to it and they
[SPEAKER_01]: buy something from the dispensary and they
think, wow, this is way more potent than I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember it being.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's an inflection point if
you have like 3% THC versus 20% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not old enough to be those in
college back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretically, I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Effectively, I went directly from college
to cannabis, so I can't really say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually never smoked myself,
so really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also the aspect that you lose
your tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're losing your tolerance to THC
or to cannabis in general, it takes about
[SPEAKER_00]: a week, maybe 10 days of not consuming at
all to lose most of your tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kids that might have in college
dabbled with a few joints, so therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: where regular users and have built up a
tolerance and then don't smoke for 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years, they lost all the tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it just the I lost my tolerance or
is it really stronger?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I leave other and let others decide on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a fair point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't have, I mean, at least when
I was in college, we didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collected cannabis either, so we
didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have no idea what the percentage
was of that back then, so it very well
[SPEAKER_01]: could have been 3 or 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we've done a good job kind of
establishing what's wrong with labeling,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least, and this is only just in flower,
and I know you have comments on tinctures
[SPEAKER_01]: and other things too, but so let's let's
talk about what ways we could we could do
[SPEAKER_01]: better or some ideas that you've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so my base base thought is don't
sell it as the high number of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you still need to inform about the
amount of THC present, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that the regulator requires that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there needs to be a THC warning on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is package sizing, particularly in
food and tincture settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you sell it, package it by THC
amount, but make it in a way that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just a given, like a bottle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to just we will switch between
cannabis and alcohol a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about beer, beer always
comes in the same volume, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same bottle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never really think about bottle
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only think about, oh, today I just
want my own beer, or if you're buying a
[SPEAKER_00]: wine, like they are small bottles and
large bottles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want just a wine bottle for myself or
do I want a wine bottle for the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: table?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you buy the different size bottle,
but otherwise you don't think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we turn THC into a volume thing,
a package size thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: The standard size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, standard size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would allow us to say,
yes, there's THC and you're buying the
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxicated part, but let's now focus on
all the other cool things that are in our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you're like, we got away from the
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about all the other things
that make our flower better than the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, in Canada, you can't do
advertisement, you can't do fancy
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling, but you can inform about
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two proposals for the THC
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be either we take the idea
of alcohol, the standard drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would have a box or a jar of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that jar is not a gram or an eight,
but there is one or two servings of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, it becomes unimportant
if the flower is 19% or 25% because you
[SPEAKER_00]: always have the same amount of THC in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we then define the servings,
the size that can be, we in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: could come up with an idea or work with
regulator on that because we already have
[SPEAKER_00]: a serving size in edibles, depending on
which country or state you are in,
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be five milligrams,
10 milligrams per serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we think about that, the standard
joint right now is one gram flower and has
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say 200 milligrams of THC would
be our serving size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just package each jar that has then
200 milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore there might be one gram or
one and a half grams or only 0.8 grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower in there, depending on the
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know that when you consume this,
you theoretically had the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if every box from every supplier is
200 milligrams, 200 milligrams of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can then start thinking how about we
buy the one with the fruity terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we buy the ones with the skunky flavor,
which comes from thiles, or we do this
[SPEAKER_00]: from the local grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can move away from THC and think
about other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the cannabis industry always talks
about the entourage effect and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other flavors and then sells it at total
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to put this all together and
do a consistent marketing messaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I understand your point here,
if you had a standard serving size,
[SPEAKER_01]: then if you had a 25% flower versus a 10%
flower, there would be more actual biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 10% because you would need more of
it to reach that serving size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's similar to beer, wine and vodka.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already know that the serving size of
beer is bigger than a shot of vodka.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you supposedly consume the same
amount of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A drink is a drink is a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you might be able to down a vodka
bottle quicker before you feel full or
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxicated, and then you have consumed
more alcohol, but that's a different
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, THC inhalation is very,
very quick in its intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over consumption is less of an issue
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it is an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: For unexperienced users on the edible
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we have serving sizes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the correlation again to
alcohol makes sense when you're comparing
[SPEAKER_01]: beer versus wine versus a spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although what about craft beer in the fact
that some of these beers are getting up to
[SPEAKER_01]: like 9% alcohol by volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the whole idea of I drink one
Budweiser and I feel a certain way versus
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these craft beers that's 9%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that more of an apt comparison to what
we're seeing with cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences in the percentages there?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because then Budweiser would have gone
bankrupt if that would be the case,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what currently happens to
all the cannabis producers that can't make
[SPEAKER_00]: a flower over 20%.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are buying a Budweiser not
because of the alcohol content,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for another reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think underlying they buy it for an
alcohol content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the alcohol free Budweiser
would be selling massively.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just saying like we see in
cannabis, the kind of the sole determining
[SPEAKER_01]: factor of quote unquote quality is your
THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the case in alcohol or else
Budweiser wouldn't be the most popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm German, so I find it difficult to find
quality in American beers, but different
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said popular, not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alcohol user or alcohol consumer is
aware that there is more to the drink than
[SPEAKER_00]: just the alcohol number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore craft beers that go to 9% or
there's some Stark beer in Germany and
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotland where they have gotten over 30%
alcohol content.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using freeze drying to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very laborious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if you want a craft beer with
more oomph, then you might do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that might be more a question of do I
want a wine or a beer of that alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: content than saying I just want to drink
five glasses of beer today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I take Bud or the 9% craft beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's not really the question you
have there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more you are considering what flavor
experience you want to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might include this craft beer of
9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you pick a white wine versus a red
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there people go and consider flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually wine might be a better
example than beer because a Budweiser is a
[SPEAKER_00]: Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes the same everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in wines, we already know that
different years from the same wine
[SPEAKER_00]: producer have different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are priced years and not so
priced years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the variety and variability of flavor
experience is priced into a wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people seek that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry has an impossible
task on trying to make a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: product that tastes the same every time
and has the same THC content every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not give up on it and think about
it more from the craft or craft brewery or
[SPEAKER_00]: the winion approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, it's something that's come up
time and time again on this podcast is the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole idea of the laser focus on THC
percentage is doing a disservice to the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for the reasons that you said that
people aren't concentrating on the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors, the aromas, or even just how
clean the smoke is, how pleasant it is on
[SPEAKER_01]: the pole or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps having a standard unit like
you've outlined is a way to sort of level
[SPEAKER_01]: the playing field.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the regulator has been able to do that
on the edible side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to regulations, there were
chocolates with like 120 milligrams of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: or the thousand milligrams THC chocolate
bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this like, oh, we put a gram of pure
THC into the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the regulator came and said like,
no, do it in a package size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the industry can adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it annoying when people say,
oh, don't do regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like industries or products adapt
to pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might even make for a better
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could assume we are early enough in
this industry, in this legal industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the US, it's still not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Germany, medical is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're thinking about regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're really early enough to
maybe do a concerted effort by the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry or the regulator to say,
THC is package size.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is package size, not THC percentage,
but THC package size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have different package
sizes for different product classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't say that the same amount of THC
should be in a joint than in a vape cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to run into issues there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this would allow us to think
about all the other benefits or so that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis has to offer to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, edibles, you know,
like you said, that has been regulated to
[SPEAKER_01]: be kind of more of a standard size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, tincture is the way
that that's measured or the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot more sense, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the amount of milligrams that are in
this volume makes a lot makes a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw a standardization there that
it's like normally like, what is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 milligrams per milliliters or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have like 100 milliliters per
bottle or so.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhat has standardized itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because you can measure the
THC before you formulate it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: product, right into the chocolate,
into the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can measure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in cannabis flower where you can't
control it as well, you just have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the weight and just say,
well, we just the weight of the biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: and just like a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go away from the ounce and the V8 and the
gram and just say package size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like we had talked about earlier,
so much of what is eventually going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into your body is going to be dependent on
what method that you use to ingest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is actually the alternative way
of labeling that I that I propose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is the alcohol side, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Package size, that many milligrams of THC
per package, like a standard drink,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a standard unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't speak to how much THC you
actually get into your system or how
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxicating that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that that edibles hit you harder
than flour because the THC is digested
[SPEAKER_00]: first in the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it forms the 11 hydroxy THC,
which is more intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a bigger buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about that joints,
depending on the architecture,
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver different amounts of THC to the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, even the same same flower,
depending on how you make it, would
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver different amounts of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go by package size, you would
have the same package size, but different
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, I think we thought of an
alternative, but a little but more
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated way to presenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not the presentation is not more
complicated, but the finding that number
[SPEAKER_00]: is more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you take your multivitamins this
morning?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a multivitamin, but I do take vitamin
D.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so how many how much vitamin D did you
take this morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's one thousand IU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took a thousand international units of
vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much milligram was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK, because the international units
are built to give the same effect
[SPEAKER_00]: independent of the formulation to the
user.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an arbitrary measure that is not
translatable from vitamin D that you took
[SPEAKER_00]: to vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_00]: That others might take or vitamin B or
whatever other multivitamins they take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the international unit doesn't care
about the amount you consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cares about the biological effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see where I'm going with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about we do a really, really
complicated, long and expensive study on
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out how different cannabis
products and formulations and consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: methods affect the body and deliver the
same and then try to find the right amount
[SPEAKER_00]: per formulation to deliver the same amount
of THC to the brain to get the same
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxication or deliver DHC to get the
same intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see, it's way more difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have done it for vitamin D and
vitamin C and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not a biologist or a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually don't really understand how
they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that it's been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a lot more variables in
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the different cultivars,
the different modes of administration and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I had to offer two
ideas, because you can shut down an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: early or I invite experts in that field to
come and help with comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might just have pushed the stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that others helped rolling it
along.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you then say, now, if you have to
figure that out, you could now say,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we sell cannabis as 1,000 IUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can say, the chocolate is
1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: One piece of chocolate is 1,000 IUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One dropper of that tincture is 1,000 IUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one joint is 1,000 IUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, and from that, we know that
it's different milligrams for the
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture, for the flour and for the
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the end consumer doesn't need to
understand now milligrams, milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliter and weight percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer only needs to remember one
thing I use or standard unit of whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to call it standard buzz or unit
of buzz, but I leave that again to other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the end consumer only has to
remember that there is one kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement or numbering and that that
user, if they are new, they are advised to
[SPEAKER_00]: take 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they see that was a bit much,
then they might realize after the second
[SPEAKER_00]: or third time, like 500 is their preferred
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for an experienced user, they might go
to 5,000 units.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they then can switch from a joint to a
cookie or to a gummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And know that they get the same buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to retry trade every
single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in the nutraceutical realms that
I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the standard unit of effect in cannabis
would also be in this semi-medical effect
[SPEAKER_00]: or realms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what medically Mariana was the
trailblazer for the legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would help with the type of self
penetration of the court.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Marcus, I know I'm already over
the time that I promised I would keep you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fascinating topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's going to generate a lot
of good discussion at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hope so too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I let you go, I'm already going
