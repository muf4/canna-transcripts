[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of conviction that we can
find a therapy that not only deals with
[SPEAKER_00]: the symptoms, but actually attacks the
source of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through my own personal research on
cannabis, I found that there's women in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular have a high concentration of
endocannabinoid receptors, meaning that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are particularly receptive to the
medicinal properties of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've read tons of anecdotal data and
research published by universities that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis does help with endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And endometriosis is tissue that forms,
very simply put, it's tissue that forms on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outer layer of the uterus,
which causes very painful periods and can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause infertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is women's health important?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a no-brainer to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're more than half the world's
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're your caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the caregivers of our children,
of our spouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of our parents, our grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not going to take care of
ourselves, then who will?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we as women fail to realize is how
much power we truly have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we are undergoing a seismic
shift in women's personal and professional
[SPEAKER_00]: power.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2020, women in the United States are
going to control 22 trillion in U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can fund our own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can push forward products and science
that actually benefit us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We women, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: women, are the biggest consumers on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're not working, you decide
what goes in the cupboards, what goes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the kitchen, when and where to make the
doctors and dentists appointments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to put our money where our
health is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music you you you you
