[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your approach to creating a
homozygous strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are also a tissue culture
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something unique that we do,
everything's in vitro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything grows in cryo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never touched.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never looked at for up to a year at a
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of this, we've been able to
really really maintain a large vault of
[SPEAKER_01]: different genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about 2000 strains that we've
hunted from about 20 countries now,
[SPEAKER_01]: the USA being one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we get these into their vessels
where they go through either a
[SPEAKER_01]: multiplication phase or a rooting phase,
but more importantly, 100 percent sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're able to sterilize these genetics,
implementing apricot meristem tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get them back to their generation
zero, which is going to return that actual
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue, that plant, that genotype to its
original vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take a sterile approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we go to create a new line,
we can pull from that vault.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get that out of tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start what's called the acclimation
phase, getting it used to being out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that 100 percent relative humidity vessel
and then getting it into our inbreeding
[SPEAKER_01]: chambers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then will take that specific strain and
we will inbreed it and we get it to about
[SPEAKER_01]: an S4.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get to an S4, we then get it back
in the vitro and we hold it in that S4
[SPEAKER_01]: stage so that when we come across another
line that really, really checks all the
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes for us, we then do the cross there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're creating stabilized offspring
in seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, that's kind of our
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also take that plasticity approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something very, very unique that we're
doing, and I've done in also traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: ag, is we are taking, I'll give you an
instance, an example of how we do this
[SPEAKER_01]: plasticity breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 35 gallon tubs, we are propagating and
growing fungus gnat larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: We harvest this fungus gnat larvae with
wire mesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we practice what we call targeted
releases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might go into one breeding chamber
and we'll disperse this larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from start to finish, we're able to
find that specific genotype that shows the
[SPEAKER_01]: most resistance towards that specific
plant pressure, in this case being a
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus gnat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they start in that larvae stage,
but then they evolve into that adult
[SPEAKER_01]: mobile stage where they're landing on your
plants, they're eating the foliage,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're causing damage to your canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're able to take that genotype,
isolate it, and then bring that over to
[SPEAKER_01]: the next generation and breed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're constantly hunting for that
genotype that has the most resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: towards that plant pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are purposely introducing a pest in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try to identify the plants that have
the trait that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're a completely sealed facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: UVC filter, HEPA filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't really have too many pest
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a lot of plant pressures that
come into our facilities, but we're able
[SPEAKER_01]: to control what does come in and then
create such a high density of that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific plant pressure that's allowing us
to do these inbreeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do this with spider mites,
aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We buy spores of PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do this with every garden pressure
that a grower is going to experience so
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have the greatest tailored
offspring when it comes to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you do it with all those different
pathogens for every line?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a target, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So every strain, there's a target.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might do a PM target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're also hunting for yields or
we're hunting for terpenes or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's always a different target.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go and try to target everything in one
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would take so much to achieve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in many cases, you're kind of
fighting one with the other.
So that's what we're going to do with the
HEPA filter.
