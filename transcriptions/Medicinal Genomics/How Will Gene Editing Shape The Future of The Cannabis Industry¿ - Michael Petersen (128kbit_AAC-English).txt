[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think gene editing will shape
the future of the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think gene editing will shape
the future of the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't say any because breeding
cannabis for THC was remarkable,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got plants that are 30 plus THC
plants, and that's all through breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: and trial and error and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thinking about what the plant may not
do on its own very well, thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the rare cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw last year at CanMed, people were
interested in CBG, CBC, some of the THCV
[SPEAKER_01]: or CBDVs, things that the plant doesn't
make very much of.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might be able to breed that,
might be able to, through many years and
[SPEAKER_01]: many iterations of breeding, get to that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think with all the information we
have, with the pan genome out there now,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can really narrow down on how to make a
plant that's got 15 to 20% CBC,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we don't have something like that
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think pharmaceutical companies would be
really interested to see what that could
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a plant that's disease resistant,
has disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: PM is out there, hoplite and viroid is out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there ways we can quickly try to
change the plant so that it's doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something it wouldn't normally do on its
own?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then not to speak of all the other
things, I think, that are outside the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The industrial hemp, I think, is gaining
huge steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all a matter of time before we're
growing hemp, just like we're growing corn
[SPEAKER_01]: and soybeans, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you mentioned the service that you
offer there at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin, where you will actually do sort
of gene editing for companies or
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, if you can divulge,
what sort of traits are they interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do work for other people,
but we also have some internal work going
[SPEAKER_01]: on as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'll be presenting at
CanMed this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hear a lot of people, like what I
just said, are interested in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: rares or something that the plant just
doesn't produce very much of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard can flavons talked about quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can flavin A and B, plant makes just a
little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they've been implicated at a lot of
different, you know, potentially cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer research, all kinds of stuff,
and a lot of the rares as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear a lot of that for CBC, CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other interests might be
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, seeds, hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we make them even more nutritious than
they are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we add certain amino acids that may
not be there for chickens, for instance?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, industrial hemp again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we make, you know, the hemp plant
sequester heavy metals more than it does,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we know it does somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we make it even better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Capturing carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp is a wonderful, you know,
it's a wonderful, sustainable plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got a huge root mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it'd be a great target for
capturing carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
All
right.
Thank you very much.
