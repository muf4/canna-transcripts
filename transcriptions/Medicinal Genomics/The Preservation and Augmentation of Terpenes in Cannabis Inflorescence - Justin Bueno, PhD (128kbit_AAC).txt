[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my name is Justin Bueno.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the Scientific Director of Goodness
Growth Holdings, formerly Virio Health.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a multi-state medical cannabis
company and I'm excited to present some of
[SPEAKER_03]: our research on a novel approach for
preserving terpene content of packaged
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis inflorescence or cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about flower for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our four markets, it is the most
popular dosage form.
[SPEAKER_03]: This may be due to some legacy reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patients have experience used with flower
in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be a little bit cheaper than other
extract products, but of course there are
[SPEAKER_03]: some advantages or potential advantages to
using whole plant product or the botanical
[SPEAKER_03]: dosage form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to other formulated extracts and
of course isolates, flowers should have a
[SPEAKER_03]: more comprehensive phytochemical
composition and of course these include
[SPEAKER_03]: entourage compounds that may
synergistically enhance the efficacy of
[SPEAKER_03]: the dosage form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially compared to oral dosage
forms, patients should see an improved
[SPEAKER_03]: bioavailability and reduce onset.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a couple of exceptions to this,
but in general, this may be the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there are also reasons for
concern when we talk about patients using
[SPEAKER_03]: this popular dosage form and many of these
concerns are around the lack of
[SPEAKER_03]: standardization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what terpenes are on the label or even
tested for will vary from market to market
[SPEAKER_03]: and from manufacturer to manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different manufacturers are using
different packaging systems and the
[SPEAKER_03]: implication on the phytochemical stability
of these packaging systems is not fully
[SPEAKER_03]: understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's little to no regulation on
cultivar or strain labeling and how that
[SPEAKER_03]: links to the phytochemical composition of
the dosage form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all this leads to lot to lot
variability which may impact the efficacy
[SPEAKER_03]: and experience a patient gets when they
consume the botanical dosage form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is not only from different
manufacturer to manufacturer, it may be
[SPEAKER_03]: even subsequent lots within the same
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one class of phytochemicals that is
especially susceptible to this variability
[SPEAKER_03]: would be terpenes and terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Spelman had a great talk yesterday
introducing some of the potential
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmacological activity of terpenes and
there's a bunch of available research on
[SPEAKER_03]: that and the field is continuing to
research the potential pharmacological
[SPEAKER_03]: activity of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also they impart their unique flavor
and aroma on cannabis and many patients
[SPEAKER_03]: directly associate this flavor and aroma
with product quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So although terpenes are a critical
phytochemical component of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: flower, their inherent volatility makes
them more susceptible to degradation as
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to the other phytochemicals
within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is relatively well established in
the industry but Dr. El-Sholi was even
[SPEAKER_03]: studying this back in the 90s,
a paper from 1995.
[SPEAKER_03]: He reported a 55% loss in terpene content
of packaged whole flower after three
[SPEAKER_03]: months of storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there are numerous parameters that are
gonna affect this rate of degradation and
[SPEAKER_03]: you can do your own internal study to kind
of assess your stability of terpenes in
[SPEAKER_03]: your either bulk storage or primary
packaging systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our in-house studies showed a 38% loss in
terpene content over a four-week duration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not only are the parameters that you
use in cultivation and then processing of
[SPEAKER_03]: flower going to affect the concentration
of terpenes in flower and the profile,
[SPEAKER_03]: once they are packaged in their primary
packaging system ready to be dispensed to
[SPEAKER_03]: patients they are not completely immune to
this variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because terpenes are inherently
volatile and even when they're packaged if
[SPEAKER_03]: you wouldn't mind clicking on the
PowerPoint slide to try to get my video to
[SPEAKER_03]: play, thank you, even when they're
packaged they're going to evaporate from
[SPEAKER_03]: flower and fill the headspace of the
container and when a patient goes to open
[SPEAKER_03]: the container to collect a dose for use
those terpenes that have evaporated will
[SPEAKER_03]: be lost to the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this is especially important in a
medical market where you don't expect a
[SPEAKER_03]: patient to consume 3.5 or 7 grams of
flower in one dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: That may occur I guess in a more in adult
use market if they're so inclined but this
[SPEAKER_03]: means that subsequent doses of cannabis
flower even from the same jar are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be at a reduced terpene concentration as
compared to the initial dose and the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene profile may change as you would
expect the more volatile monoterpenes to
[SPEAKER_03]: be lost first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the changes in profile and
concentration have unknown implications on
[SPEAKER_03]: the efficacy and experience a patient may
have when consuming cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we saw this as an unmet need in the
industry and we wanted to determine if we
[SPEAKER_03]: could come up with a solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we have, sorry, here we have a
schematic from our patent application
[SPEAKER_03]: where we wanted to investigate the use of
a two chamber system one chamber housing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis flower and then the second
chamber houses an exogenous terpene source
[SPEAKER_03]: and the thought behind this was the
exogenous terpenes would fill the
[SPEAKER_03]: headspace of the primary container
containing the cannabis and act as a
[SPEAKER_03]: replenishment source for any terpenes that
had evaporated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact we wanted to investigate this
as a replenishment source for terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: that may have evaporated.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have another cartoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case the green circles would be
the endogenous terpenes evaporating from
[SPEAKER_03]: flower and the darker blue circles would
be the terpenes from the exogenous source.
[SPEAKER_03]: So excited to present some of our
prototype proof of concept and validation
[SPEAKER_03]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here I have a photo of our prototype.
[SPEAKER_03]: The primary packaging was just an amber
glass jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The inner major matrix houses the
exogenous terpene source that the terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: are impregnated into and we wanted to
investigate if they rapidly evaporated and
[SPEAKER_03]: filled the headspace, the container of the
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our secondary chamber in this case was 3D
printed and you can see it's slotted so it
[SPEAKER_03]: allows for communication with the primary
chamber and it was actually integrated
[SPEAKER_03]: directly into the cap of the packaging
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some assembly of the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: The matrix is placed into the secondary
chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the experiments I'm going to report
here they're all performed in triplicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course our control samples did not
contain any exogenous terpenes and we
[SPEAKER_03]: looked at varying the amount of exogenous
terpenes utilized in the study using the
[SPEAKER_03]: novel system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these terpenes were added by hand
pipette.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the pipette tip there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Continuing with the assembly of the system
the secondary chamber is integrated
[SPEAKER_03]: directly into the cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the experiments I'm going to report
on today we looked at three different
[SPEAKER_03]: delta 9 THC dominant chemo types.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this material was stored for up to
five months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to mimic patient use the jars were
opened periodically and samples were taken
[SPEAKER_03]: and quantitatively assessed for terpene
content by headspace, gas chromatography,
[SPEAKER_03]: mass spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the results from samples stored with
and without the novel system were
[SPEAKER_03]: compared.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first set of data I'd like to show
you was from a sample of killer Cush which
[SPEAKER_03]: is delta 9 THC dominant material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see the initial total terpene
content which is the orange bar was 0.5
[SPEAKER_03]: percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So relatively depleted material.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit lower concentration than you
would expect in a medical market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nonetheless after five months of storage
you can see that the material was
[SPEAKER_03]: susceptible to further loss in terpene
content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this loss was found to be
statistically significant with the
[SPEAKER_03]: reported p-value here.
[SPEAKER_03]: However using the novel packaging system
in this case we're looking at two
[SPEAKER_03]: different terpene blends which we've named
relatively volatile and relatively
[SPEAKER_03]: non-volatile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get into those blends in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're showing a proof of concept for the
ability of the system to maintain that
[SPEAKER_03]: native terpene content of the flower at
the time of packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was an exciting preliminary
result.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see a little bit of variability in
the terpene content of flower stored using
[SPEAKER_03]: the novel system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this variability was not found to be
statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we're showing a novel approach to
preserve the terpene content after five
[SPEAKER_03]: months of storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Visually we can see the differences
between the samples stored with the novel
[SPEAKER_03]: system and without.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can also look at that
quantitatively using ANOVA data analysis
[SPEAKER_03]: and the difference was statistically
significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also found that we could augment the
terpene content of package flower if we
[SPEAKER_03]: increase the amount of exogenous terpenes
utilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case we're reporting the use of 3%
exogenous terpenes relative to the weight
[SPEAKER_03]: of the package flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we can see that we are showing a
proof of concept for the ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: rejuvenate material that was relatively
depleted of terpene content in this
[SPEAKER_03]: example to levels that are now approaching
what you would expect in a medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_03]: This also has some interesting
applications in adult use markets where
[SPEAKER_03]: patients or consumers are looking for
higher and higher terpene concentrations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to further investigate the
relationship between the amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: exogenous terpenes used in the novel
system and the impact on the resulting
[SPEAKER_03]: concentration of the package flower after
the storage duration.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case we're reporting an experiment
from another Delta 9 THC dominant chemo
[SPEAKER_03]: type cream caramel after six weeks of
storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have various samples that were
stored with different amounts of exogenous
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after six weeks of storage all samples
had a higher total terpene content than
[SPEAKER_03]: control.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we wanted to determine the amount of
exogenous terpenes required to maintain
[SPEAKER_03]: that native terpene content at the time of
packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the relationship was relatively
linear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And using the equation of the line we
calculate that about 1.2% of exogenous
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes would be required to maintain
that native terpene content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this equates to 40 milligrams of
exogenous terpenes per for a 3.5 gram jar
[SPEAKER_03]: of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the final experiment I'd like to
show from this part of my presentation is
[SPEAKER_03]: the impact the novel system has on terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here I'm showing two different samples
of a flower from the chemo type DJ's Gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: These two samples were grown and processed
at the same site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they differed in age by one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the sample labeled one year
post-harvest was aged one year prior to
[SPEAKER_03]: this experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that there are differences
in the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it being due to the differences in
age of the material.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also others may be due to changes in
environmental factors that are just kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of inherent to growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: One change related to age you can see is
the reduction of the betamersene
[SPEAKER_03]: percentage of the terpene profile in the
older material.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the light blue pie slice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more fresh material is 36% in the
older material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fresh material is 13.8%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this kind of makes sense as mercene is
a relatively volatile monoterpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to quantitatively assess the
differences in terpene profiles we looked
[SPEAKER_03]: at their percent differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this would be a zero to 200% scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where a result of 200% is the worst case
scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two profiles don't share a single
terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the result, the initial result was
55%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that number in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: We then stored both samples in the
presence of this eight part terpene blend
[SPEAKER_03]: shown here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after four weeks of storage we can see
that the packaged material takes on
[SPEAKER_03]: aspects of the exogenous terpene blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the differences in the terpene
profiles from the two different samples
[SPEAKER_03]: was drastically reduced.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went from a value of 55% to a percent
difference of 16%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has some interesting applications
for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: One being it may be an ability to more
reliably and reproducibly offer cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: with a consistent terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which may be propagated to patients
providing them more reliable efficacy in
[SPEAKER_03]: their dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also may be a way to more closely mimic
the terpene profile of the live plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that as soon as we harvest the
plant we're losing terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, there are some ways you can
mitigate that loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe using this approach would be a
way to more closely mimic the profile of
[SPEAKER_03]: the live plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could see future applications
where you could reliably achieve a terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profile that had been used in a successful
clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the trial determined that these
specific terpenes were critical to the
[SPEAKER_03]: efficacy of the botanical dosage form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we found that the exogenous terpenes
had different infusion rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And however they were grouped by terpene
classification.
[SPEAKER_03]: So monoterpenes had the highest infusion
rate followed by monoterpenoids and then
[SPEAKER_03]: sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again for future applications of this
technology if you wanted to establish a
[SPEAKER_03]: specific terpene profile you would just
have to adjust the concentration of the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes in the exogenous blend to account
for this differences in infusion rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So summary of the first part of my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We achieved a proof of concept for the
ability to maintain the native terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: content at the time of packaging in a
statistically significant fashion as
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to control.
[SPEAKER_03]: We reported proof of concept for the
ability to adjust a terpene profile of
[SPEAKER_03]: packaged cannabis flower and rejuvenate
terpenes from depleted material.
[SPEAKER_03]: The system was found to be effective
independent on several factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mention previously but we used
cannabis derived terpene extracts,
[SPEAKER_03]: botanically derived terpene extract and
synthetic terpenes and the system was
[SPEAKER_03]: effective in all cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course from a medicinal standpoint
probably the best application would be to
[SPEAKER_03]: use a strain specific terpene extract to
maintain as close as possible the terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profile to the strain of interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So although terpenes are of course a
critical phytochemical component in the
[SPEAKER_03]: botanical dosage form the most important
component are cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we think about cannabinoids in
flower and their stability and especially
[SPEAKER_03]: comparing them to you know traditional
pharmaceuticals or even other products in
[SPEAKER_03]: the medical markets where cannabinoids are
impregnated into various matrices,
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids in flower are more
susceptible to degradation as compared to
[SPEAKER_03]: these other products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm showing one degradation pathway here
commonly known of one where THCA can
[SPEAKER_03]: degrade to CBN through oxidation light
heat of forced degradation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not just CBN there are other
oxidative degradants with unknown
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmacological activity and toxicology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the National Research Council of
Canada is kind of acutely aware of the
[SPEAKER_03]: potential for degradation of cannabinoids
in biomass and they developed this
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid stability calculator which
estimates the rate of degradation of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we performed similar experiments
in-house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we used HPLC to quantitatively
determine the total THC content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be the concentration of THCA
times 0.877 plus the concentration of THC
[SPEAKER_03]: in flower after about a four month storage
duration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again we opened the jars throughout the
study to mimic patient use which allowed
[SPEAKER_03]: for the incursion of oxygen into the
package and resulted in loss of THC
[SPEAKER_03]: content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our initial THC concentration was about
19% and at the end it was about 16% so we
[SPEAKER_03]: reported an absolute loss of about 2.9%.
[SPEAKER_03]: This equates to a relative loss in THC
concentration of 50%.
[SPEAKER_03]: 15% which is significant on its own but
keep in mind the USP cannabis expert panel
[SPEAKER_03]: recommends a label claim specification of
plus minus 20%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we can see a scenario where a
patient has held a single jar of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: for four months and the concentration of
THC in their flower doesn't match or is
[SPEAKER_03]: approaching this label claim specification
where it wouldn't match the concentration
[SPEAKER_03]: on the label.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again that has implications on the
efficacy and experience the patient is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get when they use their material
in subsequent doses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we propose to use antioxidant vapor
phase terpenes to mitigate the oxidative
[SPEAKER_03]: degradation of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the antioxidant activity of terpenes
is well reported in the literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are using two terpene blends.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've labeled non-volatile and volatile
and all of these terpenes have been
[SPEAKER_03]: identified in cannabis and have been
linked to antioxidant activity in the
[SPEAKER_03]: literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also performed an accelerated stability
study.
[SPEAKER_03]: We added hydrogen peroxide to the vapor
phase of packaging and hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_03]: readily breaks down to two hydroxy
radicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these hydroxy radicals mimic the
oxidative degradation that molecular
[SPEAKER_03]: oxygen causes to THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: THC and other cannabinoids in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course this may lead to the
formation of CBN and other oxidative
[SPEAKER_03]: degradants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did find in our accelerated
stability study that we increased the rate
[SPEAKER_03]: of THC degradation by about 2x.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we extrapolate out our
non-accelerated study this would equate to
[SPEAKER_03]: about an 8.7 or 9 month stability study
that we were able to achieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: In about four months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now samples stored using exogenous vapor
phase antioxidant terpenes mitigated the
[SPEAKER_03]: oxidative degradation of THC in the forced
degradation study in a statistically
[SPEAKER_03]: significant fashion at all three time
points.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after four months or in this case
relative nine months of storage the sample
[SPEAKER_03]: stored in the presence of vapor phase
terpenes reduced the oxidative degradation
[SPEAKER_03]: of THC by 47%.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the non-accelerated study the results
were a little more variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So remember this was a four month study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here I'm reporting the two different
terpene blends we investigated.
[SPEAKER_03]: The three time points we looked at and
then three concentrations of exogenous
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes for each blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And only one sample which was the
non-volatile terpene blend using 3%
[SPEAKER_03]: exogenous terpenes was found to mitigate
the oxidative degradation of THC in a
[SPEAKER_03]: statistically significant fashion at all
three time points.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to investigate if there was a dose
dependent relationship we looked at the
[SPEAKER_03]: p-values or regenerated p-values from
samples stored using different percentages
[SPEAKER_03]: of vapor phase terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all samples stored with 3% vapor phase
terpenes outperformed 2 or 1%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And samples stored using 2% outperformed
samples stored with 1% at the final time
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we're showing a dose dependent
relationship for the ability of the
[SPEAKER_03]: exogenous vapor phase terpenes to mitigate
the oxidative degradation of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also showed that as the duration of the
study increased and the amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: exogenous terpenes used increased the
quote unquote non-volatile terpene blend
[SPEAKER_03]: outperformed the volatile terpene blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see at the final time point 127
days all three concentrations outperformed
[SPEAKER_03]: of the non-volatile blend outperformed the
volatile blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this kind of we added this to our study
to kind of understand the fundamental
[SPEAKER_03]: aspects of our novel system.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the impact of the physiochemical
properties of the terpenes towards
[SPEAKER_03]: effectiveness of the novel system?
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we're showing that the
non-volatile quote unquote terpenes were
[SPEAKER_03]: more effective at preventing the oxidative
degradation of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this may be because the volatile
terpenes are evaporating and being lost to
[SPEAKER_03]: the environment at a more quickly rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over time we can see that the
non-volatile terpenes are outperforming
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So summary, this part of my presentation,
we showed a dose dependent relationship
[SPEAKER_03]: between the amount of exogenous terpenes
used and the ability to preserve
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our accelerated stability study,
remember this was about an eight or nine
[SPEAKER_03]: month study.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this isn't necessarily a real world
scenario where you would have a patient
[SPEAKER_03]: that would store a package of cannabis
flower and after nine months expect the
[SPEAKER_03]: same efficacy and experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our non-accelerated study we did show that
one of our terpene blends did mitigate the
[SPEAKER_03]: oxidative degradation but we probably
didn't achieve a time point to achieve a
[SPEAKER_03]: statistically significant fashion for all
of the terpene blends we investigated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the case often that cannabis
manufacturers and cultivators can grow
[SPEAKER_03]: material faster than they can process it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when this material is sitting around,
what is the impact on the cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene concentrations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, using this technique, someone could
preserve about 62 grams of THC for a two
[SPEAKER_03]: kilogram tote of biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this would be a 47% improvement
versus control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some interesting applications
for bulk storage since we didn't really
[SPEAKER_03]: achieve meaningful results or as
meaningful results in the shorter
[SPEAKER_03]: timeframe study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, this may be a way to reduce
the formation of oxidative degradants with
[SPEAKER_03]: unknown pharmacological activity and
toxicology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to thank a couple people at
Goodness Growth Holdings, the scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: team, Eric Greenbaum and Dr. Solmaz
Aborzi, and of course, the Goodness Growth
[SPEAKER_03]: Holdings cultivation team who kindly
provided us with these samples for
[SPEAKER_03]: research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to thank you for attending my
talk and happy to answer any questions
[SPEAKER_03]: that you may have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we can just go to the next
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the approximate cost of these
supplemented terpenes for within your
[SPEAKER_01]: enclosed system?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So was the question, what's the cost of
the exogenous terpenes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's going to vary.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're talking about for a manufacturer
who has in-house terpene extraction
[SPEAKER_03]: capability, really the labor component
would be the highest cost there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is some legality around
obtaining cannabis-derived terpene extract
[SPEAKER_03]: from out of state, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I mentioned, you only need 40
milligrams of exogenous terpenes to
[SPEAKER_03]: preserve the native terpene content of 3.5
grams of flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were interested in using
botanically-derived terpenes, that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively low cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can buy one liter at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would provide many, many units of
terpenes required.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of curious, if you try to get
positive control, would you use something
[SPEAKER_02]: with a known redox activity like BHT in
there to kind of standardize your best
[SPEAKER_02]: case scenario for protection against
oxidative degradation and kind of possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: then tune your mix of terpenes towards
that ideal outcome?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having trouble hearing you,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you speak up?
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you done the control where you have
something where you know the redox
[SPEAKER_02]: activity of like BHT, where it would be a
standard antioxidant that goes into food
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would give you potentially a best
case scenario that you could tune towards
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as how much protection you get from
oxidative degradation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you looked into that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to confirm, was the question,
have we used other exogenous antioxidants
[SPEAKER_03]: that are not terpenes to compare the
effectiveness?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just something that you know what
the activity is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just published this research in the
Journal of Cannabis and Cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: Research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we used BHT to compare like you
suggest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the first time point, there was no
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then terpenes outperformed BHT at the
second and third time point as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: preserving THC content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And BHC is also nonvolatile.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of makes sense that it had some
efficacy, but then terpenes outperformed
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any concerns about
oversaturation in the initial stages?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are my slides still up?
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing we looked at was kind of
averaging all of our data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we looked at various time points as
short as one week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found that using the correct
percentage of exogenous terpenes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not really augmenting the terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just maintaining it even at the
early stages of storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because high terpenes may be caustic
or at high concentrations may be
[SPEAKER_03]: unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I definitely agree with the concern at
looking too high of a concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, it's all the way at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we have 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just what I wanted to show is that
when we look at all the data from our
[SPEAKER_03]: various experiments averaged, you can see
that there's no change.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the p-value on the top,
it's not statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not an increase in terpene
concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this looks at all time points we
investigated, which include one in two
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks all the way up to five months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not showing an augmentation of
the terpene content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's my time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
