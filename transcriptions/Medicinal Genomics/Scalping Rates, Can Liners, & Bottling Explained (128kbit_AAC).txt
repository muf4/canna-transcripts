[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about scalping rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Scalping is a term used in the beverage
industry for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It describes the process of active
ingredients in the beverages attaching to
[SPEAKER_01]: the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the packaging material could be
hydrophobic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It lacks oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have an oil like ingredients,
it may stuck to the liner, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lose its potency in the liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that process called scalping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a good segue because we're
going to talk about packaging next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe talk about some of the different
liner types that are available and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they can sort of affect that, those
scalping rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny enough, I just published an article
last Friday talking about kind liner
[SPEAKER_01]: types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the kind liner is kind of a big
issue for the whole industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have six years ago in California,
nobody's using can, everybody's using
[SPEAKER_01]: glass because all the infusion technology
are not stable in a can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is the first issue where
those have helped the industry solve.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were working with Ball, PPG,
all the big can companies and liner
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We test all their generations of liners
and we summarized okay, and we improve our
[SPEAKER_01]: formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: We summarize, okay, what formula works in
what liner?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so today I think we can confidently
make a 12 months stable beverages with a
[SPEAKER_01]: good emotion in a good liner, a good
combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, when the hemp
beverages brands are going to the market
[SPEAKER_01]: in the very fast speed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They get what they can get, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is understandable as a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes that leads to a neglect of
the quality of the liners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have seen issues that clients picked
the wrong liners and the wrong liners will
[SPEAKER_01]: lead to much higher potency scalping,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the continuous issues where
COSA is wanting to educate our clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, did I hear correctly that this
isn't so much an issue with glass?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are some of the advantages of
using cans versus glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you don't have the issue with
glass, why don't we see more brands using
[SPEAKER_00]: glass?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the heaviness of the
logistics, shipping and the recyclability,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think those are the two on the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to scalping, one of the
other things that you mentioned was oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: ingress and kind of leading to that
oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is that a factor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, oxygen is kind of the big
enemy for cannabis beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I advocate for our industry to
use beer as a benchmark, because when you
[SPEAKER_01]: make a beer, if you have high oxygen,
the flavor will change dramatically in a
[SPEAKER_01]: very short time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So beer industry has perfected their
practice on lower the DO, dissolve oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: during the production, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why what we advocate our
co-packer of the cannabis beverage to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow the practice of beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine you have a packaging that has
low oxygen to start with, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the packaging somehow allows oxygen
to come in from its CO or from the body or
[SPEAKER_01]: from anywhere, then it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a low DO to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dissolve oxygen will continue to climb up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our cannabinoids will be
continuously to be oxidized, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we see this potential
issue, especially from PET bottles,
[SPEAKER_01]: because PET, the whole bottle will allow
oxygen coming in constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not only PET, some glass bottles with,
you know, shell resistant cap,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even some can, with a special lids,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: May potentially ingress oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are having some research
collaboration with a lab right now to
[SPEAKER_01]: further look into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This seems to be an easy concept to
understand, but actually it's very complex
[SPEAKER_01]: to test because you have to remove the
oxygen, you have to control the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a nearly a year process right
now with our testing partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned for this data.
Okay.
