[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Dr. Zamir Poonja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zamir is a professor of plant
biotechnology at Simon Fraser University
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: His research interests include the
etiology and management of plant diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: on vegetable and horticultural crops and
the application of plant biotechnology for
[SPEAKER_00]: disease management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2018, his work has shifted to
research in cannabis, where his group has
[SPEAKER_00]: described a range of previously unreported
pathogens affecting the crop and has
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluated various methods for disease
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using next generation sequencing,
his team identified diverse fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast, and bacteria across multiple plant
tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their study reveals that cannabis plants
host abundant microbial endophytes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can impact plant health and product
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Findings also highlight the influence of
growing substrates and biocontrol agents
[SPEAKER_00]: on the cannabis microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss what
is the microbiome and how do microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes affect plant health,
identification of common microbes found in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis samples, including penicillium
and fusarium, whether meristem tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture is a viable microbial
sterilization method, the influence of
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilized versus non-sterilized growing
media, how growers can use microbiome
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis for early interventions,
future research questions on microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: balance and seed microbiome engineering,
and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Zamir, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, GrowDefender.
[SPEAKER_00]: GrowDefender provides long-lasting
anti-microbial protection for indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and processing spaces.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zamir Poonja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Zamir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have you back on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of our favorite guests and
favorite CanMed presenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always have great information about
plant pathogens and plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've told you this before,
but your CanMed 22 presentation on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis trichomes is the most watched
video on our YouTube page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has more than 300,000 views.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when I was getting ready for it,
presenting it, I had kind of goosebumps
[SPEAKER_02]: because some of the images that we had
presented were just incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really glad that people are catching
on to look at these fascinating structures
[SPEAKER_02]: that obviously contain all the
cannabinoids and terpenes and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a visual medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those images are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CanMed 25, we're happy to have you
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your presentation this year is going to be
about the cannabis microbiome and
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically microbial endophytes and how
they affect plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, for those who may be unfamiliar
with those terms, I guess my first
[SPEAKER_00]: question is, can you briefly explain what
the microbiome is and how it affects plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I mean, the microbiome was a term
that was coined a long time ago for human
[SPEAKER_02]: health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you know, we have microbes in
our gut and elsewhere, and those microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with various aspects of our body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some physicians feel that that
composition of microbes has various
[SPEAKER_02]: implications for health, not just physical
health, but in some cases, even your mood
[SPEAKER_02]: swings and various other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a complex interaction with
microbial organisms within human guts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's carried on to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, plants, surprisingly or
unsurprisingly, also have a collection of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes that they seem to interact with
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those microbes may be on the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the human case, it's all internal
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in plants, it can be a combination of
external, primarily things in the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: that get in through the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have a subset of the
microbiome that's internal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we refer to that as the endophytes,
endo meaning inside, phyte means plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's microbes inside the plant that,
to me, are also pretty interesting,
[SPEAKER_02]: because what are they doing there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, are they beneficial?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they causing issues in the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what drove us to start
this whole area of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, what do we know?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of purpose are they serving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they helping to carry out certain
processes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what's going on there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, there's a fair amount of
literature on these endophytes and
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiomes in other plant species,
so things like wheat and corn and tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can learn stuff from those
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, with cannabis and hemp,
I think the earliest studies on
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiomes was around 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've only been at it for four or five
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly for cannabis or the high THC
strains, this has only been in progress
[SPEAKER_02]: for about a year, a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's relatively new for these two
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in other plants, there's these
microbes that sit on the root surface that
[SPEAKER_02]: seem to help absorb nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's others that fight off pathogens
that might try to gain access to the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of these microbes enter into
the roots, the beneficials or the
[SPEAKER_02]: endophytes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, some of the ideas are that they
do have some benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, why would they be there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've taken the opposite approach is
that there may be some in there that are
[SPEAKER_02]: not beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of those would include pathogens
that also gain access to the inside of the
[SPEAKER_02]: root structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's probably a battle that goes
on between the good and the bad within the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: That part we haven't quite figured out
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we've done up to now using actually
medicinal genomics platform is to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through and sequence these organisms that
are there using what they call whole
[SPEAKER_02]: genome sequencing, where using your
platform, we're able to actually determine
[SPEAKER_02]: what the species of these microbes are
based on their sequences of DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've come up with this quite a
large volume of information that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of sorting through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this X?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this Y?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this Z?
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually we'll come up with some
sort of answer to explain what these
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now are you trying to kind of
correlate to the findings that you have in
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbiome with symptoms or morphology
of the plants themselves to try to make
[SPEAKER_00]: some connections there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really hard to do,
you know, because what we're finding is
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's no plant, there's no cannabis
plant that doesn't have a microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have a starting point at
zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything that we take up already has
a microbiome in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you ask the question, well,
if I was to add X and Y, is that going to
[SPEAKER_02]: make a difference or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've already got A and B sitting in
there already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it makes the evaluation of these
new microbes that you add more
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's A and B doing there?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you add X and Y, what does A
plus B plus X and Y do together?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not really 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about two or three recent reports
that show that when you do add X and Y
[SPEAKER_02]: back to whatever is there already,
there is some benefits that they do see
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of an enhancement of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also apparently an increase in
some of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need to be sure that it's a
consistent trend that when you add X and Y
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're actually going to see what you
think you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be hard to try to control for all
those different variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a ton of variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't even include the
environment or the cannabis strain that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using or the fertilizer that you
might be adding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that adds a lot of complications to
what we might see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, similar to the microbiome in
our gut, depending on your diet,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on whether you take in a lot of
yogurt, depending on whether you take
[SPEAKER_02]: antibiotics, that's going to influence
your microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know yours is different from mine
because our diets are completely
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: That also apply to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was looking through your
abstract, I did see that there are certain
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that you were finding in all
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was penicillium and fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the potential implications of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was interesting as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the fusarium we know is a
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to watch out for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess in hindsight, it wasn't too
surprising because we know fusarium,
[SPEAKER_02]: once it gets into the other plants,
you take cuttings from those plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a good chance of spreading that
fusarium off into the next cropping cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of knew that fusarium was
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've also seen a lot of penicillium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, penicillium is, the term we use is
ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fight it in the air, you fight it in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use it to make cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use it for various things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we found penicillium consistently and
probably more interesting than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one species of penicillium
chrysogenum, which in the early literature
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the 50s and 60s, it was described
as the species that produces the
[SPEAKER_02]: antibiotic penicillin, which we all know
is pretty useful for helping us combat
[SPEAKER_02]: bacterial infections and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is this penicillin producing
penicillium inside the plant doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's fighting off some of the
fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's fighting off something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in those two cases, the consistency
suggests to me that there's a role,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a function for that penicillium
inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if it's producing
antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a harder question to answer,
but it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it must be doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, and you mentioned that fusarium
is present in all the tissue samples and
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are these plants showing symptoms of
like a fusarium infection or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially at such low levels that it
hasn't had a chance to cause harm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's there at such low
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that brings up a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: This microbiome sequencing is very,
very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the level of detection may be a
few cells of the species that are present
[SPEAKER_02]: inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we see a positive of fusarium,
it doesn't mean the plant's completely
[SPEAKER_02]: overtaken by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means they may be, for argument's sake,
10 spores that we were able to pick up
[SPEAKER_02]: with this analytical method.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be just dormant, could be,
maybe it's being suppressed by the
[SPEAKER_02]: penicillin that's inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you allow it to grow
further, it explodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know a lot of these endophytes are not
necessarily expressing something all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them can be what we call latent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an infection that you have kind of
like what we used to have when we had
[SPEAKER_02]: COVID with no symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the virus is there, but it
hasn't exploded yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these endophytes do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They stay latent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if the plant is stressed or
there's some other environmental factor,
[SPEAKER_02]: they all of a sudden become active.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could explain what the fusarium
is doing and possibly the penicillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was going to be my question
because I know that it's been said before
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, if you overwater your
plants, you have an overly humid
[SPEAKER_00]: environment or it's particularly damp,
you're more prone to like a fusarium
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it that, you know, if the conditions
are right, it can sort of take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's really hard to get rid
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time where we've actually been
able to see it completely eliminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is using the microbial
sequencing platform is when you do
[SPEAKER_02]: meristem culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take the meristem tip,
which obviously is for eradicating viruses
[SPEAKER_02]: and viroids and other things, what we
found was that the fusarium was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was gone in those plants that came out
of the tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll just add something more to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure you're going to have a follow
up question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is that when you put those plants
out, they get reinfected really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's fusarium flying around in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some reason, those meristem
derived plants seem to be, and I haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: proven this yet, more sensitive to being
reattacked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost like you've cleaned your
entire gut of the microflora.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've taken a ton of antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the danger is that whatever comes
in next is going to completely take over
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's created this biological
vacuum, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they always say, when you've done a
dose of antibiotics, go back in and start
[SPEAKER_02]: taking these beneficial probiotics to help
reestablish your gut microflora.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be the same in these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you clean it out, you need to make
sure you put something useful back,
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficials, which would include things
like trichoderma and other beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was definitely going to have a follow up
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we sort of move on,
I just want to talk more about meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture and sort of, you know,
the general idea behind that, as I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand it, is you're taking such a
small piece of the newest growth that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're potentially out running the
infection, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The new growth is so new that the
infection hasn't had a chance to get there
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, which makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I read correctly in your abstract,
you were saying that some of the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: is still present in the meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was still a few bacterial
cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, bacteria, first of all,
they're so microscopic and they're very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very easy to move through the vascular
tissues in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unlike the fungi and maybe some of the
other viruses that sort of lag behind,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these bacteria were were seemingly
making it through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that good or bad?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically means that, you know,
the meristems aren't completely,
[SPEAKER_02]: completely, completely sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be some remnants of some
bacterial cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know even with viruses and viroids
that you don't get 100 percent success
[SPEAKER_02]: rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may be at 30, 40 percent elimination.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fungi, because they're larger
organisms, seem to be removed from those
[SPEAKER_02]: meristem tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I suppose it makes sense, too,
if the idea is that there's almost a
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic relationship between the plant
and the microbes that it would be present
[SPEAKER_00]: even in the new growth, because it may
very well be essential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's doing something that we still
haven't quite figured out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing that you had touched on
earlier was the idea of taking cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the mother plant is infected with,
I think it was fusarium that we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, that the cutting is going to have
those same symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the implications there
for growers who rely on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something where they have to be
really careful with the with the fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, in addition to fusarium,
you're also carrying over some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: endophytes, the good and possibly the
other bad ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we found was that there was a really
high correlation between the overall
[SPEAKER_02]: endophytes that you established using this
microbiome method and the endophytes that
[SPEAKER_02]: were originally in the mothers,
which I mean, in hindsight, you could say,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, of course, we know that,
you know, mother to progeny, you get the
[SPEAKER_02]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also implies that pathogens will
move in that direction as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you can't possibly tissue
culture everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not suggesting we go and Maristem the
entire population of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you can do early on, you know,
at the time of rooting is where we think a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of these endophytes and other
microbiome members are getting established
[SPEAKER_02]: is when the roots are starting to to be
formed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're thinking that as you start
rooting, in addition to whatever may
[SPEAKER_02]: already be there, you can supplement that
with beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, things like trichoderma,
gliocladium, some of the bacteria come to
[SPEAKER_02]: mind added in early so that as the roots
start to form, these microbes can get in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and potentially out compete the
fusarium and some of the other microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was another thing I was going to
bring up was this idea of the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, because I think it was said that
sterilizing the cocoa fiber growing medium
[SPEAKER_00]: actually didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that sterilizing the cocoa
fiber growing medium didn't influence the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome of the cuttings grown in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean in terms of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that so that was a double edged sword
in the sense that there's two aspects to
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first is that if you've got a mother
plant that's already got endophytes or
[SPEAKER_02]: other microbes in it and you take cuttings
off of that, you'll be moving along those
[SPEAKER_02]: those particular endophytes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we call that horizontal transmission.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of moving from from one side to
the next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if you plant that in a substrate,
what you'll find is that the whatever's in
[SPEAKER_02]: the substrate growing medium doesn't
really have a huge impact on whatever has
[SPEAKER_02]: already been established.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, there's sort of a
buffering effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that speaks to perhaps the substrate
not having a major effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you go backwards and consider
the mother plant and the mother plant
[SPEAKER_02]: before that, those plants, if they're
planted in a substrate that has a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes in it, they'll start absorbing
those microbes from the surrounding
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at a time course,
time A, the substrate becomes very
[SPEAKER_02]: important because the substrate will
influence whatever is getting into the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant at time A.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you take a whole bunch of
cuttings all the way to W, X, Y,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Z, those microbes that came from that
mother plant seem to be somewhat well
[SPEAKER_02]: established.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then whatever's in the substrate
doesn't seem to make a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: difference because they're already
established.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes and no, the substrate can have an
influence in getting that initial
[SPEAKER_02]: population established.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I think the best scenario
would be sterilizing that substrate just
[SPEAKER_02]: to be sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then adding back in there what you
feel are the beneficials, whether they be
[SPEAKER_02]: trichoderm or gliocladiums, get those set
up and then stick your plants in those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea would be that those will try
to out-compete whatever is already present
[SPEAKER_02]: in the cuttings and make it a beneficial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I suppose that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep mom happy, keep mom healthy,
when you're creating your cuttings,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to recreate that same substrate for
the cuttings and then hopefully that would
[SPEAKER_00]: continue on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where this whole idea
of living soil comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've never experimented with
living soils myself because we work with
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic systems where everything has to
be, you know, clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: But living soils have the advantage that
they also carry a huge complex of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiomes or microbes that can have some
impact on the plant that's subsequently
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in that environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difficulty I have with living
soils is that I don't know totally what's
[SPEAKER_02]: in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we need to do with the
microbiome studies is now start looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: living soils and finding out exactly what
it is that we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, living soils do differ.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've added a molasses solution to it
or you've added some other organic
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer, that's kind of influenced the
microbial composition and that could then
[SPEAKER_02]: impact the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly there needs to be more work
in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think we've done a good job talking
about how endophytes microbiome impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about concerns from a consumer
standpoint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I mean, you know, because the
technique is so sensitive, we're finding a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of interesting things that you
wouldn't have been able to culture or grow
[SPEAKER_02]: on media and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you first look at the data,
you go, oh my God, there's so much stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can't lose sight of the fact that
every plant, every vegetable, every fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: product that we eat is covered with
microbes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a microbiome that's
associated with the tomato that you eat
[SPEAKER_02]: and the cucumber that you eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't lose sight of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because cannabis is more highly
regulated, right, they want to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that you don't have the negative
microbiomes present.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could help address the issue of these
microbes that are like aspergillus that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're really concerned about.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of that actually originates with
the microbiome itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much of it is actually coming in
from the external environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: The data we're seeing suggests that
aspergillus is not huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not huge in the microbiome itself as
the plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not like harboring it and
picking it up and storing it like
[SPEAKER_02]: penicillium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be that the aspergillus is an
external factor, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming in maybe through high humidity
conditions or poor growing conditions or
[SPEAKER_02]: poor drying conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's the case, then it at least
allows growers to manage the environment
[SPEAKER_02]: more than they have to be worried about
the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hoping that some of this
microbiome eliminates causes for concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though you've got such sensitive data
that you've got eight or 10 cells of one
[SPEAKER_02]: microbe and it may show up as a positive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's interesting you mentioned
aspergillus because one of the arguments
[SPEAKER_00]: against doing aspergillus testing is that
it's ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't possibly be growing without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting to find for you to not
find it, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at the early stages anyway of
plant growth, it may establish itself
[SPEAKER_02]: later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely not one of the high
numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that I see that we may end up
spending more time looking at is Fusarium
[SPEAKER_02]: because we are seeing Fusarium early on
all the way through the plant and in some
[SPEAKER_02]: cases getting into the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that happens, the flower
infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those species also produce various
mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we know that one can originate from
inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that may be more concerned in
the long term than perhaps aspergillus
[SPEAKER_02]: that could be an external source of
inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is definitely interesting
because I know Fusarium is a problem and a
[SPEAKER_00]: concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've developed QPCR testing to try to
screen plants for it, which is why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of interesting that if it's so
ubiquitous, perhaps there needs to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of cutoff or threshold where it's
more of a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would take more study.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we don't want to add any more
regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think what we want to do is make
sure that the regulations that we are
[SPEAKER_02]: using make sense, like make biological
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know aspergillus is up there because
historically it's had some major issues on
[SPEAKER_02]: human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's not as prevalent or not
embedded in the plant and it's coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: outside and perhaps not as much concerned,
then maybe we need to reassess what the
[SPEAKER_02]: important microbes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, too, that you've analyzed
different tissue types from roots to
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves to flowers, stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the insights there from
looking at the different tissue types?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there's a fair amount of
variation there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And similar work has been done with hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a couple of papers that have
shown that there are tissue specific
[SPEAKER_02]: groups of microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that means is that you might find one
type more prevalent in the roots and
[SPEAKER_02]: another type more common in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely the roots have the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the next tissue that has high
levels are stems, which kind of makes
[SPEAKER_02]: sense because that's where the transport
is occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then less so in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves seem to have fewer of these
endophytes and other microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're only now in the process of
analyzing the flowers, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: critical phase of the analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have to be a little careful with
flowers because, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of external introduction of
these microbes from the air, from water,
[SPEAKER_02]: from whatever else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we do the microbiome analysis of
flowers, it's not showing only what's
[SPEAKER_02]: internalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could be external things that that
come into play for that for that analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of giving growers some actionable
items from your research, like what I know
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of touched on some things about
using trichoderma or beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that, what other sort
of advice could you give based on your
[SPEAKER_00]: findings here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think growers have some favorite
genetics, genetics that they've been
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging on to that they really want to
keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be not a bad idea to test the
microbiome of that particular plant or
[SPEAKER_02]: series of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can collect root tissues or you can
collect stem tissues and set it off for
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll give it'll give them an idea of
what sort of the background microbes that
[SPEAKER_02]: are already established in the mothers,
because we know that a good proportion of
[SPEAKER_02]: that are going to move on to the cuttings
and then so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and it may also reveal what
other pathogens could be could be present
[SPEAKER_02]: that they had no idea were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely for favorite genetics that
are being stored for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and do a microbiome analysis on
it and see see what you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Following that, cuttings made from those
plants, I would definitely suggest they be
[SPEAKER_02]: rooted in a medium that has beneficials in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't go into details about which ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some growers have preferences over what
they consider beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely have those on early.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some growers tend to put it on
later when the plants are rooted and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting ready to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say put it on much earlier and get
those established.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one fungal organism that we didn't
touch on is the is the mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mycorrhizae being those, we know
they're all pretty much beneficial fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised that there is mycorrhizae
present already in some of these plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plants that seem to have a
favorable relationship with the
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're finding it in the roots where
you'd expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finding it in the stems,
which we didn't expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're even finding it higher up in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it almost suggests these mycorrhizae
may be carried along through the
[SPEAKER_02]: successive development of that plant,
which to me was a surprise, because we
[SPEAKER_02]: always think of it just in the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's definitely a beneficial that
needs to be looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and it's great advice to kind of get
your microbiome analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to put you too much on the spot here,
but if someone were to do that and looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at their report, are there any certain
microbes that would sort of be a red flag
[SPEAKER_00]: that they potentially have an issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how would they go about remediating
something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's always surprises
when you get down to that level of
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's always concerning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one thing that I didn't mention that
probably is worth mentioning is that when
[SPEAKER_02]: you do get the microbiome results back,
it also reflects cells that may be dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, the microbe may have been
there, but it's not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're getting a total analysis of the
past and the present in terms of what
[SPEAKER_02]: could be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we haven't seen any super
surprising results vis-a-vis something new
[SPEAKER_02]: and exotic that hasn't been reported
before in North America or some other
[SPEAKER_02]: really bizarre.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finding what we would expect are
microbes that grow in substrates,
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes that are in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really interesting because one of
the hits, we call it a hit, it's a match.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the matches we found in these
samples was human DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking, OK, there's human DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it makes sense because people are
touching the plants, they're watering
[SPEAKER_02]: them, they're doing things to the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of our skin cells come off,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they land on the tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they can be mixed up with
with the DNA that we extract from the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some human DNA, which I mean,
somebody may freak out and think,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's that doing there?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's sensitive enough that some cells
from human hair or skin cells could show
[SPEAKER_02]: up in the analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking forward, I know that you said
that we're still very early on in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the microbiome for cannabis and
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some questions that you have
that you're looking to answer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: coming years?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for sure, we need to find out what a
good balance of microbes is.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, I don't just throw a
number out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have maybe, let's say, 50 different
species that are present in a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to narrow that down to maybe the
optimal four or five that we think are
[SPEAKER_02]: always there, that they're serving a good
purpose, one being the penicillium,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe the mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then see if we can enhance those,
in other words, favor the plant so that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going in a different direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing is there was a
report out of Europe just last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They compared cannabis or hemp varieties
that had been heavily selected or bred
[SPEAKER_02]: over time versus some that were more or
less wild or hadn't been successively bred
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they looked at the microbiome
differences between those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they found was that in the ones
that were heavily bred, the microbiome
[SPEAKER_02]: variability was way lower than what you'd
find in the natural plants or the
[SPEAKER_02]: so-called the land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that's happening as
we evolve with more and more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis or hemp varieties is that we're
altering the microbiome composition
[SPEAKER_02]: without even realizing we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we knew what some of these
beneficials were, we would definitely want
[SPEAKER_02]: to add those back to that subset
population that's being used for breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes to make sure that they have the
necessary background.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I found interesting was
that seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a fair component of the microbiome
that ends up in the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously that's carried over to the
next generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that to me is also pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we modify the seed microbiome early on
to alter its characteristics so that maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: it begins to show favorable factors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one quick mention, of course,
is that we know from the scanning
[SPEAKER_02]: microscopy studies we did where we can
look inside the plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason they're in the seed is because
we're pretty sure now they're traveling
[SPEAKER_02]: through the vascular system.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting into the xylem and finding
their way into the seed, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if this is a seed plant, and finding their
way inside the seed that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so we're going to see some more great
images?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't looked at the seeds myself yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll bet you that there's definitely
things in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can show you some really nice images
of what we call the plumbing system of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, which is the xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually find these spores
embedded, all different kinds of spores in
[SPEAKER_02]: there that nobody has ever seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a visual confirmation that the
microbiome is shifting, moving up the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video might break a million when you
have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anything beats the
trichomes, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trichomes are, I mean, this is pretty
cool too, but the trichome photos,
[SPEAKER_02]: it still just blows me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good you mentioned seed because I
had a question earlier and we kind of had
[SPEAKER_00]: moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you were talking about how,
when you take the cuttings from the mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and sort of introduce it,
the microbiome sort of established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the substrate microbiome is not going
to have as much of an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the same true for seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you place a seed, into a growing
medium, is there more of a chance that it
[SPEAKER_00]: could influence it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good, I would say that a
seed that's just starting to grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: putting out a small root would be more
influenced by the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you can have positive and
negative effects at that young,
[SPEAKER_02]: very young stage because it's not as well
established as a cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cutting is, you know, a hundred times
larger and it's got its own microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the seed could be influenced by
external factors in the substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would definitely make it important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zameer, winding down here before I let you
go, I want to give you a chance to share
[SPEAKER_00]: with the listeners or viewers any other
resources on this topic that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: might be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to put a link in the show
description or just links to any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: work that you're doing or ways that they
could potentially get in touch with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, we actually just submitted not
too long ago that paper that describes the
[SPEAKER_02]: endophytes and other microbiomes in
cannabis plants and it's provisionally
[SPEAKER_02]: being accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may come out in the next week or
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'll do is probably send you a link
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got the latest information on
cannabis endophytes and maybe that link
[SPEAKER_02]: could be hooked up to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people would love to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Zameer, great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, thanks again for joining us on
the podcast and look forward to seeing you
[SPEAKER_00]: down in Puerto Rico for CanMed25.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always great to talk to you and it's
nice to be able to cover different topics
[SPEAKER_02]: every time we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be seeing you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
