[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, I spoke with Jamie
Brambilla, who is the co-owner and founder
[SPEAKER_00]: of Grace Health and Wellness and Heed CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie and his wife, Nicole, specialize in
coaching and educating patients about the
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical use of cannabinoids and other
plant-based medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The principal aspects of their mission are
to democratize plant-based medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: democratize the science, taking the
complex pharmacological information and
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking it down so everyone can
understand the therapeutic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Can Med 2022, Jamie will present a case
study in which the combined use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, psilocybin, a ketogenic diet and
conventional oncology treatments induced
[SPEAKER_00]: remission in a stage four metastatic
breast cancer patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That patient just so happens to be Jamie's
wife, Nicole.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss the
lack of awareness and training amongst
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians about the clinical use of
cannabis, the enduring stigma around
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use, how cannabis can be used to
treat cancer, how Jamie and Nicole built
[SPEAKER_00]: the infrastructure necessary to have
access to consistent, high-quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical-grade cannabis medicines to
treat her cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also talk about the barriers that
prevent other patients from accessing that
[SPEAKER_00]: same quality, consistent cannabis
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we discuss the collaborative
project that Jamie and Nicole have
[SPEAKER_00]: assembled to take cannabis formulations
against cancer through the drug approval
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Jamie, I wanted to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Grace Health and Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grace Health and Wellness aims to enrich
healthcare through compassion,
[SPEAKER_00]: empathy and scientific knowledge so we may
turn the corner and achieve a better age
[SPEAKER_00]: of holistic wellbeing, nourishing mind,
body and soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do so by producing effective
plant-based medicines for individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: seeking alternative therapies.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Jamie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie Brambila.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Jamie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Ben, thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to talk with you
today because I know you and your wife,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole, have had an amazing cannabis
journey that spans both your professional
[SPEAKER_00]: and personal lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the best place to start is for
you to tell the audience about how you got
[SPEAKER_00]: started in the cannabis field and sort of
the events that have got you to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first of all, I wanted to just express
my gratitude for being on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you really are doing a great job
putting these podcasts together before the
[SPEAKER_01]: convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we got started in the cannabis
space back in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a small delivery service out in
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And initially we had gotten into the space
because we thought it was a good business
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quickly we found out that all that green
rush rhetoric was just an illusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started focusing on really trying
to help out people because we started
[SPEAKER_01]: getting phone calls from people that were
in dire straits looking for answers with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, mothers that had children with
epilepsy, autism, people that had cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: severe neurological disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really wanted to provide them
with the best information the most
[SPEAKER_01]: practical information for them to find the
efficacy using cannabis medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When in the middle of our research trying
to search for answers for patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: my wife Nicole was diagnosed with stage
four metastatic breast cancer and
[SPEAKER_01]: automatically, you know, it was a no
brainer to use all of the knowledge that
[SPEAKER_01]: we had gained to help her because we knew
that cannabis could save her life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're obviously kind of in a unique
position there having had experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis and knowing that it could
be effective for your wife's diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you first tackle that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you first apply the knowledge that
you had gained in the industry to helping
[SPEAKER_00]: her?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew that even though it's a pretty
nascent science, the understanding the
[SPEAKER_01]: concept of cannabis turning off a cancer
cell, we understood enough to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: pursue this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's no clear reference as to
what type of cannabis strain will
[SPEAKER_01]: positively respond against a cancer cell
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did our research.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we placed it up to God and we
gave it a chance and we had excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: results as a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were privileged to enjoy those results
because we know that for a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: that this is not an option simply because
they don't have access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we always talk about how
there's sort of a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: variables here in order to kind of find an
effective treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because first is a number of different
types of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, cancer is sort of an
umbrella term that describes a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, on the medicine side,
on the on the strain side, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of different chemical profiles in these
strains that are all kind of grouped under
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did you go about, you know,
identifying which strains might be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for your particular case or your
wife's particular case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, you know, we were very fortunate to
have people that were very knowledgeable
[SPEAKER_01]: about this subject around this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have we've been very privileged to have
the guidance of practitioners that have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of experience with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, at the end of at the end of
it, we had to make an educated guess to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out what to use for Nicole
specifically because of all the all the
[SPEAKER_01]: factors that you mentioned that are
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that as we go further in
exploring this topic, we're going to find
[SPEAKER_01]: out that there's a lot of specificity
between, you know, the patients genotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant's genotype, the chemotype
expression, how to bridge the gap between
[SPEAKER_01]: all those three parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost seems like it's individualized
medicine that we need to adopt to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, for us, it was it was
just a matter of doing our homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would focus on strains that have really
white profiles of minor cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, our strains are
proprietary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tell you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are strains that are closely related
to their wild ancestors, if that makes any
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that you were fortunate to
have access to a lot of great doctors who
[SPEAKER_00]: had experience using medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your experience working with
other doctors who maybe weren't in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space, but you were, you know,
in the course of treatment, telling them
[SPEAKER_00]: that you were going to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was their reaction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they supportive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they knowledgeable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's actually prompted us to take on
our mission, really, because we still have
[SPEAKER_01]: a medical system that looks at cannabis,
regular cannabis use as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: substance use disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea for physicians at large to use
cannabis therapy on a consistent basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still a long way to figuring that
out in the clinics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still a long way for doctors to
adopt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from our personal experience,
I can tell you that when we were trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: look for the best cancer care for Nicole,
you know, we were living in Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: California at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved to the New York tri-state area,
specifically to look for the best cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: clinic that we could possibly source for
Nicole.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the opportunity of having an
oncologist that was a world renowned drug
[SPEAKER_01]: discovery researcher, very well versed in
targeted therapies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We exposed the science to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We explained that we were using cannabis
in the context of trying to find the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution for cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, even though she saw the
results, she saw the scans with her own
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She couldn't explain the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, you know,
she told us, well, you know, you're part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the very few and very lucky people that
get a result like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know anything about the
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we still have an old guard in the
medical science community that's still
[SPEAKER_01]: holding strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really believe that it's because of
the stigma that cannabis has tied to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even though this is thoroughly
researched in preclinical essays,
[SPEAKER_01]: we still have a medical community that is
unwilling to look at this because they
[SPEAKER_01]: have their preconceived notions about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of that do you think comes down
to like a lack of training as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that, you know,
health care professionals, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: learning about the endocannabinoid system
in their training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the big reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have proper training for
medical professionals to understand this
[SPEAKER_01]: very complex system in our physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you know, we've done a lot of
advocacy and a lot of trying to raise
[SPEAKER_01]: awareness for the benefit of patients to
have an open relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: physician about the use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's not something that
they can even wrap their head around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some doctors believe that the
endocannabinoid system, or nowadays how we
[SPEAKER_01]: know it as an endocannabinoid dome,
is too good to be true for them,
[SPEAKER_01]: in short.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to understand such a complex system
of ligands and receptors, interacting
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, cannabinoid mediators,
you know, all fires, operating throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: our system at the same time, perfectly
choreographed to create a balance
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout all of our physiology,
it's a hard concept to bring across.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, some universities are
adopting or looking at the science and
[SPEAKER_01]: adopting courses to educate people that
are willing to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still for the cannabis
enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not part of a medical curriculum yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need this to be looked at as a
viable clinical approach in medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way that we're going to
get this into the clinics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a reality that we have to
grapple with if we really want to see this
[SPEAKER_01]: back again in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we agree 100%, especially here on
the CanMed side, where we're trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: our part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're partnering with our good friends
Bonnie Goldstein, Dustin Sulak,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Spellman and Eloise Thiessen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're leading our one-day medical
practicum, where we invite health care
[SPEAKER_00]: providers and anyone who's interested to
come and get sort of a one-day crash
[SPEAKER_00]: course, master class, whatever you want to
call it from, you know, some of the real
[SPEAKER_00]: titans in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's any health care providers
out there who feel like they need a primer
[SPEAKER_00]: on the endocannabinoid system and all the
things that cannabis can do in the
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical setting, please definitely check
that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a wonderful opportunity that
you guys offer because you have some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most brilliant minds giving
instruction on this topic, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a rare thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and like you said, when you were
sort of early in your cannabis journey,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were on the side of, you know,
being a medicine provider, you saw
[SPEAKER_00]: firsthand that how many people are lacking
guidance, for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they know that cannabis can be
helpful for their condition, but they just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know where to turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we, as a cannabis community,
really need to do our part to help educate
[SPEAKER_00]: those providers so that they can help
their patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, no, that's such an important part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, bridging that gap of,
you know, giving enough information for
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians to confidently prescribe this
to patients, we need to do a lot of work
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do a lot of work with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the cannabis education
plays a big role, having consistent and
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable supplies of pharmaceutical grade
botanical drug preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it sounds like letters there,
but the viability of having these
[SPEAKER_01]: available in dispensaries, we're still a
long way from having these available to
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: At dispensaries, you know, they focus on
creating a CPG product that's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: good for the consumer, that's going to
sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not looking at, you know,
consistent reproducibility with chemo type
[SPEAKER_01]: expression, so that if a person that uses
this and is able to correct symptoms of
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic disease, they can go back and
source the same product over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still are a long way from having access
to that type of formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we lived through that throughout
our own experience with Nicole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to just emphasize this
because we were very lucky to be in an
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, to be established in an
industry, to already know how to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: these formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to give you an example of all of
the infrastructure that we had to build,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the know-how that we had to create all
the parameters that we had to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had to first, we had to
source the strains that we thought were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to produce the anti-cancer effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to convince seed banks to share
their genetics with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to source cultivators that had the
capabilities of growing these plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled environment, and that were
willing to set aside a production space to
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusively produce and specifically grow
these strains for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to learn sophisticated methods of
extraction so that we made sure to extract
[SPEAKER_01]: all the therapeutic compounds from the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while still maintaining chemical
integrity of the cannabinoid groups,
[SPEAKER_01]: we really believe that the acid
cannabinoid groups have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, to tie all this together,
we had to figure out quality testing to
[SPEAKER_01]: really make sure that we were getting the
same chemo-type expression, to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that the quality of the product was always
the same for Nicole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the clinical guidance,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how do you start off with a
particular dosage, with a starting dosage?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you titrate slowly to avoid side
effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how do you make such a robust
cannabis regimen functional for a person?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those are the very critical
parts or points that most patients do not
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are not gonna build a lab to,
you know, get consistent supply of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis flowers or produce their own
cannabis medicines and put together all
[SPEAKER_01]: this infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not, it's not realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why we have to make these
available for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's amazing that you were
able to put all that together,
[SPEAKER_00]: literally from like, seed to sale,
but you know, we say that term as kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to express the whole life cycle
of a product, but you've certainly done
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the average patient, the average
consumer certainly doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources or the know-how to put something
together like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so, you know, it's a sad thing that
we don't have this available for patients
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, we see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see it in the infusion rooms when we
see people that are going through the
[SPEAKER_01]: harshest of cancer treatments and doctors
don't have the effective tools to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with those side effects yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have anti-emedics, we have anti-pain
medication, we have anti-anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: medication at the end of the day,
it may or may not work for a patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some patients take it diligently and you
know, they become numb to their situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the reality of the
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis does such a great job at getting
rid of those side effects and doctors know
[SPEAKER_01]: this, you know, we've known this since the
eighties, since the seventies,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've, you know, under the table,
doctors will recommend to their patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, well, why don't you try cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe it'll ease some of the
pain or whatever, but really don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't go beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is the sad reality is that
patients that don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: resources to figure this out, don't have
the best reference to gain the knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: to gain the access.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look towards their medical
professionals and they're not willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to them about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have very few doctors that do
recognize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them, because they have seen
positive results with their patients and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're turned on to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, they make a little bit
time during their really busy schedule to
[SPEAKER_01]: the research a little bit about it,
but that's just a select few.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really need to raise awareness so
that we can give people the knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: resources to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great point too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how primarily was Nicole using medical
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it to sort of alleviate some of the
side effects of the other treatments that
[SPEAKER_00]: she was using, or was it actually,
you know, targeted to try to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce tumor growth or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was specifically, so we knew that
we could try to use cannabis to turn off
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the end goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get to that point, we had to,
you know, we had to slowly introduce her
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Nicole's particular situation,
she was very sensitive to the effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have a patient that's highly
susceptible to the psychoactive effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, you have to move very carefully
and very slowly to try to trade that
[SPEAKER_01]: dosage up to the levels that we thought
were going to create an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Against the cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually these are levels that surpass,
you know, 400 milligrams of THC on a daily
[SPEAKER_01]: basis or, you know, the same amount in the
acid cannabinoid group, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a thousand milligrams of CBDA daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are really high dosages to get a
patient on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know what you're doing,
you can really put off the patient with a
[SPEAKER_01]: bad experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to make sure that the strains,
that we really understood the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of the strains, whether it was a
mood enhancement profile or a mood
[SPEAKER_01]: depressing profile that would create
somnolence, for example, we had to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out how to appropriately dose each
formulation throughout the day so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: could create this as a functional
experience for Nicole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering if you could speak
specifically about the presentation that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be giving at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the listeners a little preview of
what they can expect there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to, all the science that we
have researched, that we have collected to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out this project, we're going to
explain during our presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give an overview of all the
identified mechanisms through which
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis can turn off a cancer cell or
create that programmed cell death,
[SPEAKER_01]: apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also going to explain how we used
cannabis in combination with psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use psychedelics to ameliorate the
depression that's really tied to the side
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of standard cancer therapies and
the prognosis of having a terminally,
[SPEAKER_01]: a terminal disease because metastatic
breast cancer is a terminal disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to explain how psilocybin in
particular has possible anti-cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanisms, just like cannabis and in
fact, cannabis and psilocybin signaling
[SPEAKER_01]: pathways to turn off a cancer cell
interlap, ironically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to speak about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to talk about Nicole's
case study that is going through peer
[SPEAKER_01]: review publication right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing as a result of our
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have all this wonderful
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already solved this issue in our
minds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis needs to be in the clinic,
but how are we going to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the biggest question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'll explain more of the
science aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wanted to hone in today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And explain the social issues that are
around this and how that needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: addressed so that we can get this into the
clinics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that you mentioned
is research, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the barriers to really
getting acceptance from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the greater medical community or even,
you know, the society at large,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to see more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with that is a bit of a
chicken and the egg situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we can have, you know, the legal
framework opens up to allow for more
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't really generate that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, so we're in sort of this
tough limbo right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily we have folks like you and the
other presenters at CanMed who are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the best with the limited resources and
support that they have to try to get us
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it becomes a very complex
project because taking cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually what we want to do is provide
this for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way that we've identified
that the medical community can fully
[SPEAKER_01]: embrace this is if we take cannabis
formulations against cancer through the
[SPEAKER_01]: drug approval process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a big to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the infrastructure to do that is
just barely being written right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have FDA coming up with task
forces that are evaluating projects like
[SPEAKER_01]: this on an individual basis because the
rules have not been well-defined yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so cannabis has a lot of nuances that
regular pharmaceuticals don't have to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of heterogeneity in the
compounds that cannabis plant produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're producing from whole plant
formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of critical points to
make sure that you have sustainably
[SPEAKER_01]: reproducible formulations that can go
through the rigor of FDA approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've really taken this on as our mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we, as a result of that,
we have committed to building a team that
[SPEAKER_01]: is knowledgeable enough that it has enough
resources to actually take this through
[SPEAKER_01]: the drug approval process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to do that, we had to
partner up with some of the best academic
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical research institutions,
some of the best science research
[SPEAKER_01]: institutions in the United States and in
the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, with a project like this,
you have to account for things like
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilization of your cannabis genetics,
you know, sustainably propagating your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, which probably is in some sort of
in vitro propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have controlled environment
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have the most rigorous
screening methods like a mass spectrometry
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis to verify that you are producing
all the chemo types and all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have capabilities to identify
unknown contaminants because we still
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know 100% of the content for the
therapeutic compounds that come from a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular cannabis strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a complex process that
traditional pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_01]: biopharmaceutical companies are really not
used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no precedent for this type of
pipeline yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping to shed light on this and
really, you know, be successful in our
[SPEAKER_01]: journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite the undertaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, on a previous podcast,
I spoke with Daddy Mary, who's out in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel and who's doing a lot of research
specifically on cancer and treating with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned that you need the
capability to identify those minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I remember correctly from my
discussion with him, some of the effective
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids for treating a particular
type of cancer that he was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: they were unnamed cannabinoids that,
you know, weren't even really in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature, aren't something that your
average cannabis testing lab is looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I would imagine that your
capabilities on that side would need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty, pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, luckily we have the right
people in every corner to pull this
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've partnered up with Imperial College
of London.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've agreed to undertake our in vitro
and in vivo studies on eight of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis extracts that we've successfully
reproduced at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have now tracked clinically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've partnered up with the University of
Connecticut with their organic chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: department, molecular biology department,
for us to figure out how to reproduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: chemo type that we're looking for in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how to screen for these unknown
compounds that you're mentioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still are a long way from knowing 100%
of these compounds and what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't isolated most cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even know what they look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this is a project for only
the most seasoned scientists to
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in because it's a discovery
all throughout the journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may find out about things that we
didn't even think about it along this
[SPEAKER_01]: journey, but the commitment to bringing
these medications to people is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we believe that we have a good shot at
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think that your story is
very emblematic of what we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about here in CanMed, because it takes a
village, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you need to work with the
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to work with the scientists,
the clinicians, the laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals to really make this thing
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, that's what we try to do in
CanMed is to bring people from all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas of the industry together
so we can kind of push this whole thing
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a great tie-in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll mention this, Ben, you know,
as a cannabis community that's focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: research, sometimes we clutch onto the
proprietary information that we have,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't want to give away our secrets
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if we just came together
and not placed our projects as valuable,
[SPEAKER_01]: but place the patient really as the
valuable person here, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we could come together and share the
knowledge that we have, we could get there
[SPEAKER_01]: much easily and much quicker than the
trend that we are in right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with that 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great place to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I let you go, I want to give
you a chance to share with the audience
[SPEAKER_00]: any links to learn more about you and
Grace Health and Wellness, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: social media, your website or any
publications that you guys have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to include it in the show
description so people can easily find you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please check out our website, gracehw.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few articles that have been
published on the work that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, there is an article on
cannabis science and technology magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: of an interview that we recently gave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just pretty much describes all the
details that revolve around this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when the day comes that we're
able to dispense these medications to
[SPEAKER_01]: people that really need them, that's the
day that we'll be able to ease a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be very happy to speak about our
work during the presentation at CanMed and
[SPEAKER_01]: answer any questions during the
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
