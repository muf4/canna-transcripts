[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a safe and happy holiday
season and I hope you were able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: some time off, maybe get recharged,
and you're ready to take on 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that our team is excited for this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I record this, we are just over five
months away from the CanMed 23 Innovation
[SPEAKER_00]: and Investment Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an invitation-only three-day event
that will feature intensive industry
[SPEAKER_00]: workshops and more than 30 presenters
covering the latest innovations in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all takes place at the Marriott Marco
Island Beach Resort in Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: May 15th through 17th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a new venue for us, and with it
comes a lot of outstanding amenities,
[SPEAKER_00]: including three miles of white sand beach,
world-class spa and golf, and much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head over to CanMedEvents.com now to learn
more about CanMed 23 and request your
[SPEAKER_00]: invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you're there, be sure to also
sign up for email alerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be sharing the first round of
CanMed 23 oral presenters very shortly,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some additional information
about our industry workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Dr. Addie Ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addie is a neuroscientist known for her
extensive expertise on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is an assistant scientist at Legacy
Research Institute and adjunct faculty at
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her human and preclinical research is
focused on pain management, addiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addie has published in top academic
journals under the surname Wilson Poe,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she is passionate about the
interaction between cannabis and opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our conversation focused on a paper Addie
recently co-authored called The Nose-Nose,
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma, but not THC mediates subjective
effects of smoked and vaporized cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the title suggests, the study found
that users subjective enjoyment of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flower's aroma was correlated
with that flower producing a pleasant
[SPEAKER_00]: effect for the user.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or more simply put, if you like the smell,
or more simply put, if you like the way a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flower smells, you're going to
like the way it makes you feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss the
subjectivity of cannabis aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the ability to predict a positive
experience through aroma is learned or
[SPEAKER_00]: intuitive, how closed container markets do
a disservice to consumers, how the study
[SPEAKER_00]: found that the amount of THC in a cultivar
did not correlate with positive user
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, and what that means for the
industry, the difference between feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: high and feeling good, and the importance
of tolerance breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with Dr.
Addie Ray, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Founded in 1999, Advanced Nutrients was
the first to develop a complete nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: system that unlocks the true genetic
potential of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since its inception, the brand has
introduced more than 50 innovations to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation community and continues to
revolutionize the space through
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary scientific discoveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at AdvancedNutrients.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Addie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to be here, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I'm really excited to talk
with you today about a paper that you
[SPEAKER_00]: co-authored called The Nose Knows Aroma,
but Not THC Mediates the Subjective
[SPEAKER_00]: Effects of Smoked and Vaporized Cannabis
Flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fascinating paper to me because it
really challenges this idea that THC
[SPEAKER_00]: potency determines cannabis flower
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's come up many times
on this podcast, so I'm happy to see some
[SPEAKER_00]: data confirming this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great information in the
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I marked up my copy quite a bit,
and I'm providing a link to the paper in
[SPEAKER_00]: the show description so the listeners can
read it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get too deep into it,
I wanted to ask you, why did you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: co-authors decide to take on this study,
and what questions were you looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess what we should really
highlight is that the study, the paper,
[SPEAKER_02]: is actually a byproduct of the actual
purpose for the work because the purpose
[SPEAKER_02]: for the work was a couple of weed cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, cannabis competitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the purpose there, of course,
was to identify objectively the best
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So truly using the most rigorous
scientific tools we could to really
[SPEAKER_02]: identify high-quality cannabis and then
reward those cultivators for producing
[SPEAKER_02]: that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the original intent behind all
of the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a result of doing those cannabis
competitions here in Oregon, we were able
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, come up with this big
anonymous database, which then we could,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, mine post-hoc for all of the
insights that you see in the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really important for my
teammates and I, and I'll highlight them
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically, Steph Barnhart and Jeremy
Plum, among many others.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was a community effort to use
the best tools possible to define quality
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you said this, you collected this
data over several years or several events.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did your criteria for determining
quality cannabis change as you did this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's funny, it didn't change a
whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 2017 was the first time that we
really sat down to think about what are
[SPEAKER_02]: the components that we are trying to
analyze here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What questions are we going to ask of our
volunteers who are sampling the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's kind of no brainer
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, you know, like, how much did
you enjoy this?
[SPEAKER_02]: We always knew that aroma was important,
so we asked how pleasant was the aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also asked questions about the
sort of large domains that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: well known for, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is it energizing or sleepy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it make you feel relaxed or tense?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, really, you know, not rocket
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really all the things that all of the
reasons that consumers are using cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we were looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the human sort of data
collection end of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the other end, too,
you know, we wanted as much information
[SPEAKER_02]: about the plant as we could, you know,
at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had the widest panel of analytes in
terms of cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, of course, our
understanding of this plant and the
[SPEAKER_02]: aromatic molecules that contribute to its
aroma have evolved a lot since we last
[SPEAKER_02]: collected data in, you know, 2019,
2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, it was really important
for us to have high fidelity human
[SPEAKER_02]: information and high fidelity plant
information and see just literally,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a fishing expedition.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the data going to tell us?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really liberating in the sense
that, you know, most of my academic
[SPEAKER_02]: research is, of course, hypothesis
oriented.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really liberating to have a true
expedition and tell a data-driven story,
[SPEAKER_02]: allow the data to tell us what's important
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like so you're collecting
two different types of data, as you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, you know, on the human side,
what was your experience with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, on the lab side,
you know, what are the percentages and the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So so imagine you tried to marry the two
to try to find some patterns in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of what you're doing in
the paper here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you don't see in the paper are
all of the results that are not so
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so, you know, one of the things,
of course, we are super interested in is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what is this entourage effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what evidence do we have that a
combination of molecules is somehow
[SPEAKER_02]: contributing to some domain of the human
experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: And despite our best efforts to put it
through machine learning models and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, apply all of these like really
rigorous techniques to the data,
[SPEAKER_02]: it spat out a couple of things,
one of which was THCA is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, we we kind of already knew
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we didn't find, you know,
any one terpene, for example, that was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, strongly associated with any one
particular domain of the of the human
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, despite our best efforts to
look for those things and prove or
[SPEAKER_02]: disprove those sort of urban legends that
are floating around out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we are seeing being sedative,
for example, our data didn't support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so, yeah, we we weren't able to really
hone in on any one particular molecule as
[SPEAKER_02]: being the driving factor in the cannabis
experience, other than knowing that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, THCA, the, you know,
decarboxylated version or the carboxyl
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We we already knew that was important.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what contributes to the
psychoactive properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting that you mentioned
terpenes because, you know, we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes a lot and how they're important
and how they, you know, differentiate the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I mean, you're not the first
person that I've talked to that said that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they looked for a connection
between terpenes and experience or even,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, therapeutic applications,
but they're not really finding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that, you know,
terpenes are a bit of a red herring here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that the most likely what's
going on and I, you know, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is just one of many possibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's likely going on is that things
are a lot more complicated than we would
[SPEAKER_02]: like them to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking for the easy answers and
it's probably not an easy answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the cool opportunities that I had
in sort of digging through the literature
[SPEAKER_02]: to prepare this manuscript was getting
really, really deep into the sensory
[SPEAKER_02]: sciences and, you know, even like looking
really deep into fine fragrances,
[SPEAKER_02]: perfumes, consumer fragrances,
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that body of literature is,
you know, very mature and there's lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: cool artificial intelligence models for
aroma, you know, predictions and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I came to understand,
and there is a citation in the paper,
[SPEAKER_02]: was that the presence of even a single
additional aromatic molecule totally
[SPEAKER_02]: changes our perception of an aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's true for just your olfactory
epithelium inside your nose, what else is
[SPEAKER_02]: happening higher up, all the way up in
your brain and especially, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the really sophisticated circuits in
our prefrontal cortex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we know that, you know, the presence
of even one other molecule can totally
[SPEAKER_02]: change our experience of a product,
then that's probably what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably just such a complicated and
a situation that's so difficult to
[SPEAKER_02]: replicate time after time that there's,
you know, we're really at the limits of
[SPEAKER_02]: our technology, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We simply don't have the tools to process
all of the information better than our
[SPEAKER_02]: brains already do, which is to say,
this smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, I mean, I mean, we've kind
of been beating around the bush here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was sort of the main finding of
your paper, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, you know, what smells good to the
user is usually predictive of what is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to create a good experience for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that subjective component,
I think is really important to highlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we do show some data in the
paper where there is, if we look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: variability in people's responses or,
you know, their ratings for the
[SPEAKER_02]: pleasantness of the aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some flowers where they have
a high, you know, score, they're really
[SPEAKER_02]: great smelling flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those great smelling flowers,
there's a lot of consensus.
[SPEAKER_02]: People agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's low variability in terms of the
aroma score.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the further you get away from like
the, you know, top 20% of great smelling
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers, the more polarizing they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, on the far end where we have
some flowers with low aroma scores,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a huge degree of variability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people love them and some people
don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the analogy that I think about all
the time, again, coming back to perfume,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think it's the most apt
comparison, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can all agree that this super
expensive, you know, like designer perfume
[SPEAKER_02]: at this specialty perfume house,
we can all agree, oh my God, this thing
[SPEAKER_02]: smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if we're walking through the mall
and there's someone's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying something cheap into the air,
that one might be a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: polarizing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be some of us that would be
like, oh yeah, I'd wear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And others would be like, no, no,
no, no, don't get near me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a really nice comparison
because it tells us that it really is
[SPEAKER_02]: subjective, that there's some degree of
consensus.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a really great smelling
flower, you know, the breeder or the
[SPEAKER_02]: wholesaler or a budtender might be able to
say, okay, these three are the best
[SPEAKER_02]: smelling ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is absolutely a subjective
component where a consumer must be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: make a decision for themselves based on
their own sensory perception of that
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm curious too, and we could talk
a bit about, you know, how, what the
[SPEAKER_00]: profile of the different users are,
whether they're daily users and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of information about
that, but do you think that what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on is that people are smelling something
familiar?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it might be similar to a strain
that they've used in the past and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: associating that with a positive
experience or is it just truly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, intuitive where like,
Oh, I like this smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it just so happens that
that's what their body wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, my hypothesis and you know,
I'm a neuroscientist and my, my field is
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely not the sensory sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe someone with that kind of
training would give you a more intelligent
[SPEAKER_02]: answer, but my hypothesis is the latter,
that it's just intuitive, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you're walking down the street,
that reaction you have, when you smell
[SPEAKER_02]: the, you know, falafel cart on the
sidewalk, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That reaction that you have is not
something that you're like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: that reminds me of that one time that I
was in New York city, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for New Year's Eve, whatever, you know,
like it's an intuitive, like it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's strums the instrument within
your heart, you know, like you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reaction there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's like the, you know,
like gross, or sometimes it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: appealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that aroma is really
interesting because all of the old factory
[SPEAKER_02]: processes and the evolution of being able
to smell things in the environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: interpret those environmental cues as
either a cue to approach or avoid
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's really, really deeply
buried in our medulla.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's really old circuitry
that is conserved across, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the phylogenetic tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my sense is that there is like low
level, you know, intuitive or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, you know, sort of automatic kind of
processing that happens with aroma that we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't necessarily need to put much
conscious thought into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of looking at, you know,
THC percentages or terpene percentages,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're evaluating which cannabis to
buy, we should really be getting our nose
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and giving it a smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, I think, the biggest take home
message for all of the regulators in
[SPEAKER_02]: states where there are closed container
laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Oregon, you know, I'm here in
Portland and we have the benefit of
[SPEAKER_02]: having, you know, deli style dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can literally walk into any store
and stick your nose in an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that benefit doesn't occur in
California and in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really in those closed container
markets where the regulators have done a
[SPEAKER_02]: serious disservice to the consumers
because they have robbed them of the only
[SPEAKER_02]: information that we have to make a really
great decision about what to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is that in place for, you know,
sanitary reasons or is that the thinking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's probably if I look
at the most likely answer is probably just
[SPEAKER_02]: a law enforcement one, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of keeping things
tightly under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I wasn't there when they made
those regs in Washington, so I can't say
[SPEAKER_02]: what those motivations were.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can say that, you know, it's not,
you know, those sort of package only
[SPEAKER_02]: markets are problematic, not only from the
perspective of, you know, being devoid of
[SPEAKER_02]: aroma, but it's excessive packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, which is like, I'm sure,
an entirely different podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so going back to this whole idea of,
you know, sort of the quantitative results
[SPEAKER_00]: that we often see on packaging or on
websites is not as informative as just
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the some of the results from your
paper were showing that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC potency was not correlated with
subjective appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the the amount of terpenes
present wasn't either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could talk a bit
more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I would be so delighted to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite topic in the whole wide
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, and there are very good
reasons for this right now, THC is the
[SPEAKER_02]: primary marker of quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this has roots both in the
legacy market, you know, in the
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition days, there are, you know,
sort of black market drug dynamics that
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute to why people who produce drugs
want to make them as strong as they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that legacy that has carried
over into this regulated environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this regulated environment,
there has been a push toward more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: potent products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Demand for high THC products has been
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, you know, the supply chain
responds by producing high THC products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have this feed forward cycle
where everyone is producing what they
[SPEAKER_02]: think the customer wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the customer thinks they want THC
when, in fact, our paper demonstrates
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, the amount of THC is
really irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not at all, you know, our data doesn't
support and I don't think that THC is
[SPEAKER_02]: irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's very obvious that there is
a relationship between THC and
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what gets you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there is not a linear
relationship between how much THC and how
[SPEAKER_02]: much enjoyment there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that brings up another topic,
which is this distinction between getting
[SPEAKER_02]: high and feeling good, because you know,
there is a therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sweet spot where you do need THC
to feel something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have too much THC, the negative
effects outweigh the beneficial effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that there is an assumption that more
THC is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: More THC is high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: More THC is a better value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's this, you know, like ever
escalating push toward more and more THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not an evidence based approach,
because this this data tells us that,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, THC is going to get you high,
but it's not necessarily going to make you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and I I always think it's interesting
that, you know, this push for more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more potent cannabis, more higher
percentages of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you look at alcohol,
I mean, that's just it's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people aren't going to the
liquor store and buying Everclear or just
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking straight ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's it's more of an experience about
the flavor and, you know, everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just interesting that cannabis hasn't
gotten there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the fact that you use the word
yet, because I think that we have an
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a wake up call that it's time to
diversify the dispensary shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like right now, the way that the
retail marketplace looks, it looks very
[SPEAKER_02]: much like going into a bar that has 37
flavors of Everclear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we think about, well,
what what does what does the consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: actually want versus what do they think
they want?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they actually want is probably
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to try a bunch of different
stuff because there are a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different kinds of experiences that are
possible with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting that, you know,
alcohol really is a great comparison
[SPEAKER_02]: because we have a pretty narrow band of
responses to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows what it feels like if
you're over 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows what it feels like to have
one drink or have a little buzz or to be
[SPEAKER_02]: drunk or to be too drunk.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those are all very there's a lot of
consensus around what those things feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with cannabis, it's far less clear
that what I'm experiencing is what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's very common that you
might be at a party or something and
[SPEAKER_02]: people are passing in Jay around and some
people are talkative and fine and keep
[SPEAKER_02]: taking toke after toke and others are very
quiet and sitting on the couch by
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that even even the literal same
joint has different effects in different
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think that this this paper
really demonstrates that we owe it to our
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers to give them choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to have IPAs and,
you know, naturally ferment to skin
[SPEAKER_02]: contact white wines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we also need commodities
like Anheuser-Busch, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we just need to have a range of
choices and that those choices a consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: should be able to choose on the basis of
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you brought up a great point
when you were talking about how,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the same joint can have
different effects on different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made me curious, too, going back to
your results here and people who were
[SPEAKER_00]: rating cannabis for the pleasurable
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were those pleasurable effects actually
subjective, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning, did people were they looking for
an energetic high versus a sleepy high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, was there differences there,
too, that you sort of had to layer in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the anchoring question that we use for
our volunteers was, what do you consider a
[SPEAKER_02]: good cannabis experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we gave them a range of answers
from I don't want to feel anything at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to feel totally normal to I want to
be so high that it's almost uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have, you know, some choices in
between there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And regardless of, you know, their age or
how frequently they consume cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: the vast majority of people reported that
they wanted a prominent shift from their
[SPEAKER_02]: normal state of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So regardless of people's tolerance or,
you know, the products they prefer or
[SPEAKER_02]: their experience with cannabis or any
other factors, most people are looking to
[SPEAKER_02]: feel quite a bit different than their
normal daily life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the way that we sort of
typified, you know, what the volunteers
[SPEAKER_02]: look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that stood out to me
when I was reading the paper was that
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller amounts of cannabis consumed
actually had better subjective appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the the answer to this,
it probably has something to do with the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that people self titrate how much
cannabis they use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kerry Cutler at Washington State
University is a wonderful colleague of
[SPEAKER_02]: mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's shown this very elegantly by having
people smoke and take dabs over Zoom
[SPEAKER_02]: calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she shows that, you know, people who
are using higher, more, more potent
[SPEAKER_02]: products, they tend to take fewer puffs
and hold it in less amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there seems to be, you know,
this effect where people especially
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, this is a double blind
evaluation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people don't know the strength of the
products they're trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so probably what's happening is that,
you know, they'll pack a small bowl or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like the end of a joint and take
one puff and kind of see where they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they stop because they're happy
where they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may be an artifact in the data that,
you know, the vast majority of people just
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked very small amounts of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, wherever the data
is stacked, that's where you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: find all of those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing here, the less frequent
cannabis users reported better subjective
[SPEAKER_00]: scores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I this is really a mystery to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't have a hypothesis for why
this might be, you know, in the process of
[SPEAKER_02]: the peer review, our referees asked us,
well, is this because of tolerance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it because these these folks are,
you know, they're able to register the
[SPEAKER_02]: pleasant effects of cannabis because
they're not using it as often?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could be contributing to some
extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also asked all of our participants
to take a 48 hour tolerance break before
[SPEAKER_02]: they started their kits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also gave them at least 30 days to
complete, you know, all of the samples
[SPEAKER_02]: between eight and ten samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was it's just, you know,
we might have had a handful of judges who,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, were already daily users or
consumers and they used all of their
[SPEAKER_02]: products, you know, date one day after the
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, most of the people in the
study, like the vast majority,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, spaced them out really nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they adhered, you know, more than 80
percent of the people adhered to the
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerance break sort of guidance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't necessarily think tolerance
entirely explains that phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might, you know, if I had to
like if I'm if you're going to put me on
[SPEAKER_02]: the spot to give you an answer,
say it's maybe just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a party if it happens every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just more special if it is,
you know, not as often.
[SPEAKER_02]: We our brains habituate to our
environments and our, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: our situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just might not feel as special or
fun or cool if it happens more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the whole idea of
tolerance, too, it's a bit of a double
[SPEAKER_00]: edged sword where if you if you're taking
breaks, you might be more sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the positive aspects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're also more sensitive to the
negative aspects, too, with the paranoia,
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually something that we
actively work with with our chronic pain
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my other studies, you know,
we work with, you know, people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to use cannabis to manage their
orthopedic pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a process of developing enough
tolerance to reap the medical benefits of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, of course, you know, initially
for some of our folks and these are also,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a lot of older folks with
orthopedic, you know, issues, arthritis
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, hip replacements and
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, growing up in the Nixon era
of prohibition, it's no wonder that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're hesitant, you know, and a little
bit afraid to even start.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but we specifically go through a sort
of ramp up the start low, go slow kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: mentality is the best way to get our
patients up to a level of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: THC consumption that sufficiently
eliminates their pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have built up enough of a sort of
psychological tolerance to it that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: in a comfortable headspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny you bring that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking through some videos from
our press past KMED conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting ready for for the one that's
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking at a presentation from
Dr. Dustin Sulak that was part of our
[SPEAKER_00]: medical practicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was talking about this,
you know, that therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you need to get up to a
point where you're feeling the effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't want to necessarily exceed
that either or else, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can kind of get to a point of
diminishing returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to actually,
you know, take a step back or lower the
[SPEAKER_00]: dose, which is sort of counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting how you need to really
find that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Dustin and I are very close
colleagues.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see, you know, eye to eye on this
issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that idea of the therapeutic window
for our patients is not exclusive to our
[SPEAKER_02]: patients, you know, but for the adult use
market, I tend to refer to it as the sweet
[SPEAKER_02]: spot, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to stay in your sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if your tolerance has gotten so high
that you can't get up into the sweet spot
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore, then it's time for a tolerance
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our brains are remarkably responsive
to tolerance breaks, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I haven't seen quite enough
literature to satisfy me on all of my
[SPEAKER_02]: hypotheses around tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from all of the, you know,
the limited literature there is and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the heaps of anecdotal data that are out
there, taking a tolerance break really
[SPEAKER_02]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Adi, before I let you go,
I wanted to give you a chance to plug any
[SPEAKER_00]: other resources related to this that you
think that our listeners would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: read up more about, or any of your own
social media or websites or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, please let me know and I'll put it
in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if folks have questions for me or
want to, you know, learn more,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can always reach me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at Dr. 80.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. 80.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's probably the easiest way
to get ahold of me or to to find out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what other work I'm producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see, I would say that in
general, other things that I think might
[SPEAKER_02]: be timely to highlight are just the fact
that, you know, right now we're speaking
[SPEAKER_02]: in mid December and there is a ton of
outdoor flower that's curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to hit the dispensary
shelves, you know, probably early January.
[SPEAKER_02]: And outdoor flower in particular,
because the outdoor environment is so,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, diverse and unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means the chemistry in those outdoor
flowers tends to be more diverse also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a cannabis consumer and
you're listening to this, I would
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage you to, you know, ask your
budtender which smell the best and which
[SPEAKER_02]: ones were grown outside and just
especially support your regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Adi, thank you again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a great, great conversation.
