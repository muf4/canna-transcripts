[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll begin by thanking Kevin and
Doug and the organizers for the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to be back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at CanMed, I guess, a year and a
half ago or something in Boston,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was a lot smaller than this,
so it's great to see the growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth in the cannabis area in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're switching gears from earlier
talks, which were focused on humans and
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and disease states, to the plant
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've sort of tailored my talk to
speak specifically about genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk too much about the
plant other than to say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an amazing organism that we're
talking about with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used, it has been used for thousands
of years, maybe going on 10,000 years by
[SPEAKER_00]: humans for very diverse purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no other plant species,
I think, that humans sort of access widely
[SPEAKER_00]: that is both a source of food and,
you know, that pile of hemp seeds that I
[SPEAKER_00]: show on the slide, a source of fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's bast fiber in the stems of
cannabis that is very, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: high tensile strength and used for
clothing and fish nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it's a medicine because
that's what we're talking about here
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by medicine, I mean, you know,
it can actually treat disease or alleviate
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, but it's also a drug,
it's a social drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the picture on the bottom left,
which I sort of scooped off a paper that
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Russo published a while ago is
actually a shaman's grave from Western
[SPEAKER_00]: China.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something like 2,700 years
ago that this individual was buried with a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of grave goods and something
like 740 grams of dried cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a, you know, a plant that
humans have already utilized going back
[SPEAKER_00]: that far for its chemistry, like THC and
other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what my lab has done for a while now is
really focused on cannabis as a producer
[SPEAKER_00]: of unusual chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my trajectory as a researcher was from
trying to understand cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis, so the biochemical pathways
by which cannabinoids are formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'll go back one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that led more and more to be involved
in genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2011, I was part of a Canadian team
that published the first cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually the first medicinal plant
for which a genome was known.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was about 22 other plant genomes
known at the time, but these were things
[SPEAKER_00]: like wheat and cotton and soybean,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis was really a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a genome that's pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 820 megabase pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not huge, but relatively complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually sequenced a cultivar or
what we were in the day calling a strain
[SPEAKER_00]: called purple kush that we obtained the
leaves for the sequencing from a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis patient in Vancouver,
British Columbia, who was growing it for
[SPEAKER_00]: himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't, you know, a big sort of
corporate enterprise at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave or donated a handful of leaves
that we isolated the DNA from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has been an extremely successful
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, it's very incomplete.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genome is fragmented.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave people the raw materials to do
further analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly not finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in today's talk, I'm going to
highlight a couple of areas that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, what we've used the genome for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess where I'm trying to go here is
that, you know, sequencing a genome is one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You churn out a bunch of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make it available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a lot of computational work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really the raw materials for
other science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things, the key one,
question number one, that we tackled both
[SPEAKER_00]: with the genome and before that was trying
to figure out how cannabis cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenes are formed in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, you know, how does THC acid or
cannabidiolic acid or myrcine or
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-karyophylline on the terpene side,
how are they actually made?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the genes that control their
production?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we did that was actually
twofold.
[SPEAKER_00]: One approach was to focus in on the plant
structures that make cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the glandular trichomes that
are found on the female floral tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So female flowers are the bud of the
flower that, you know, you'll smoke or
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rich in cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason they're rich in
cannabinoids is because cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_00]: not just made in leaves or in green
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually made in these little
disks of cells that are underlying a resin
[SPEAKER_00]: droplet on the top of a trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: A trichome is like a microscopic hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can see it with your eyes,
but it looks like a little bit of a sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of shiny, crystally thing on a plant
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took those cell types, those specific
cell types of trichomes, and analyzed the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression in them using DNA
sequencing technology that was available
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able, together with a lot of
classical biochemistry, a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the sort of grunt work that grad
students are in the lab at midnight doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: to really figure out all of the enzymes
and the genes that encode those enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are present in the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, from the sort of basic building
blocks of plant metabolism, down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: finished end products that an audience
like attending CanMed here is interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in, things like cannabidiolic acid,
which is the precursor to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know how those are formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really the power of genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, cannabichromic acid,
CBCA, which is on the bottom right of the
[SPEAKER_00]: slide there, we actually didn't look at
the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We analyzed the genome in its entirety to
find that enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one sort of success story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We similarly, and I've heard that voice of
the time limit, the voice of God so many
[SPEAKER_00]: times, I actually dropped slides from my
talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But similarly, we've done biochemical work
using the purple cush genome to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how the terpenes, for which cannabis is
well known as well, how the terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the enzymes that make terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up having basically all of
the metabolites that are labeled on that
[SPEAKER_00]: slide, though the major cannabinoids like
cannabidiolic acid, cannabigerolic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC acid, cannabichromic acid,
and the major monoterpenes, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: the compounds that Ethan Russo was talking
about as well, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: beticariophylline, imersine, and pining.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all of those enzymes, and that's
from genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we did with our genome is
moved away from the biochemistry for which
[SPEAKER_00]: my lab was sort of established.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really focused on the evolution of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the genetic structure of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And by genetic structure, I mean,
what are the relationships amongst all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different types of cannabis that we
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that drug type cannabis and
hemp are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard various conversations around CBD
from hemp and CBD from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're interfertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis, the drug form, whether it's
called marijuana or cannabis, are drug
[SPEAKER_00]: type cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp are grown and really bred for
different purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp is the source of those seeds and
fiber for which I sort of showed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first slide, while marijuana or drug type
cannabis is for the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids like THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're very similar sort of
morphologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, hemp is a lot more sort of
scraggly looking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drive past the hemp field,
and we have about 100,000 acres of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in Canada each year, it's not as
sort of pristine, beautiful crop like you
[SPEAKER_00]: see in a modern medical cannabis
production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within drug type cannabis, of course,
we have this sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this canonical classification,
which I actually think is probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: that meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the classification is that drug type
cannabis is divided into indica style
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or type plants and sativa type
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica type plants would be sort of
shorter, stockier, broader leaflets,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with more of a sedative or sort of
body stone, versus sativa, taller,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of lankier, more open flowering
plant, narrower leaflets, and with a sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of stimulating or cerebral effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what, you know, whether you're
in a dispensary in Vancouver, where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: from, or going online in California,
or wherever you are, people classify drug
[SPEAKER_00]: type cannabis, marijuana type cannabis
into these types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also describe a third type,
the hybrid, the mix of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of how we think about
cannabis broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we have this kind of,
this crazy chaotic world of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains or cultivars or chemovars,
white widow, sour diesel, Jack Herrera,
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog, what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have been sort of, I would say,
haphazardly named in many cases by the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who sprouted the seed or got a
clone from their buddy and really enjoyed
[SPEAKER_00]: and gave it a new name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we tried to do with our genomics
work was use genotyping, that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to sort of analyze the genetic
differences between organisms using a scan
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't sequence every single piece
of DNA in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scanned the sort of high points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got 43 samples of DNA from hemp
types and 81 drug type or marijuana type
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we analyzed them using a technology
called genotyping by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this gave us was a data set of
about 14,000 single nucleotide
[SPEAKER_00]: polymorphisms or SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be individual genetic DNA code
differences between those samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was in, when I say we,
this was in collaboration with a
[SPEAKER_00]: population geneticist at Dalhousie
University named Sean Miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we crunched that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, really, the problem moves away from
a plant problem or a DNA sequencing
[SPEAKER_00]: problem into a statistical problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we used was, or at least as we
visualized the data here shown as a
[SPEAKER_00]: principal component analysis, we found
that there was one group, that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: upper right-hand group in green,
that was the hemp type.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very broadly separated from drug
type cannabis, which suggests,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, you know, it backs up what we
already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're grown for different purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have even originated from
different sort of gene pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: But within the drug type, we found some
relationships, but it was sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger, more spread out group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we dug in more closely,
what we were trying to do was correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: what we called the reported ancestry,
so the percentage of indica or percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of sativa as described by the grower or
the seed company that provided the sample
[SPEAKER_00]: with what the genetic type said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the R squared, the correlation between
reported ancestry and genotype was .36.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a low to moderate correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, there wasn't a lot of
evidence to support genetic differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between indicas and sativas as they were
described by the people who grow those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what we're, what we're sort of
exposing here is, you know, the inaccuracy
[SPEAKER_00]: of that indica sativa dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I don't suggest is that it
doesn't mean there's not subjective
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between cannabis types.
[SPEAKER_00]: People clearly see that, whether it's
medical or recreational use, and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: more sedative types and more stimulating
types, but it's just that the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: identity and then also the ability of the
grower, the processor, the dispensary to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you information around that is not
really on firm footing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go back one slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next for cannabis genomics?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're going to see now is a
movement towards using genomics to fast
[SPEAKER_00]: track breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had this, you know, wonderful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's widely grown, probably every
continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about Antarctica,
but I'm sure someone has tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been really kept out of labs,
you know, in universities, governments,
[SPEAKER_00]: larger corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's improvement has been limited to the
sort of underground breeding world,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has has to be applauded for its
amazing success in increasing THC levels
[SPEAKER_00]: and bringing CBD back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it hasn't solved some of the problems,
things like, you know, powdery mildew is a
[SPEAKER_00]: widespread fungal pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors continues to be challenging in
different latitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really what we need is a genomics to
accelerate crop improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just, just to finish my talk,
I sort of highlight three areas where I
[SPEAKER_00]: think this kind of new wave of cannabis
science driven by genomics is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: move things along for our industry and for
the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is it's a potential resolution for
this strain chaos problem in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, we need trust in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more predictable effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: For patients and consumers, we need a
better understanding at a purely
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific level of how cannabis evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think by applying more genetics,
getting more samples, doing more in-depth
[SPEAKER_00]: analyses, we're probably going to be able
to link, you know, a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think humans are always going to
want a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to want a list of
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whether we have Merlot grapes
and we have Honeycrisp apples and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: Dalmatian dogs and we name those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're going to continue to
name cannabis, but we need some genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: identity that backs that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, genetic markers are
going to accelerate breeding, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering traits, disease resistant
traits, specialized chemistries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard THCV mentioned earlier,
CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we want to drive towards breeding
and providing plants that have chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps patients, also has recreational
properties that are desirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last point, and I think, you know,
this is already being worked on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, is that, you know, we have sort
of generally sort of two tools or have had
[SPEAKER_00]: two tools in plant improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is traditional breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a sort of a third way,
which is genome editing, that's using
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized and revolutionary techniques
called CRISPR-Cas and related approaches
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually make changes in genomes,
whether it's an animal genome or a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Towards a desirable outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, now cannabis is
finally sort of coming out of the closet
[SPEAKER_00]: as an organism that labs can work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see the application of this
technology fairly soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it GMO or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the EU says one thing and North
America says something else, so it's a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a debate, but I think this is coming as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'll end and if there's
time for questions, I'll take some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's microphones for questions in the
front of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a question, I think you need
to go to the mic at the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to find out more specifically
what kind of markers, what loci you are
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning to find disease resistance,
for instance, and possibly the auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I partly know a lot of my
work is more of a commercial nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm sort of a bit hesitant to,
other than to say, you know, flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time control is a key area that we're
dissecting in our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And disease resistance, specifically
around botrytis and powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think are huge drivers of crop,
maybe not loss, but loss of value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on those two as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanna know, is it GMO or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's no GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in terms of CRISPR, I don't think
it's GMO because the changes made,
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome editing technique is the same
thing that would happen naturally with
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation, or you could induce it with a
chemical or radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's safe to say it's not GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the idea that we have GMO
cannabis already, there's no GMO cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it may exist in a lab,
but it's not something that's out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild in terms of production or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think we have to worry about
that yet.
That's it.
