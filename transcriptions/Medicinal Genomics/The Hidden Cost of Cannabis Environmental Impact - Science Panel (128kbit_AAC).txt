[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good morning, and I thank you for
your interest in this topic, and I'm glad
[SPEAKER_02]: to see all four of our panelists are here
to join in this discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's been two years since I had
suggested this topic to the organizers of
[SPEAKER_02]: CanMed, and a lot has really happened
within this particular area during that
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been growing interest in the field
of sustainability and how it needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: adopted within this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have 60 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do hope to have audience
participation, so we will leave time for
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I would like to move to introduce
our panelists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just do that briefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they will introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really lucky to have these four
individuals here because they cover a big
[SPEAKER_02]: swath of the topics that can fall under
the hidden costs of cannabis, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually really broad, covering
environmental impacts as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: interface between the environmental
impacts and human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have Professor William Beswety from
North Carolina who has been fundamental in
[SPEAKER_02]: adding to our understanding of some of the
biogenic volatile organic compounds that
[SPEAKER_02]: emanate from the canopy of cannabis grows
and his involvement in how to mitigate
[SPEAKER_02]: those compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have Professor Ted Grantham
from UC Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who has been studying water issues related
to illicit cannabis grows within the state
[SPEAKER_02]: of California and just the increasing
water demands for this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have David Traylor who is going to
bring a unique aspect to the discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a biochemist turned venture
capitalist and he's been active in funding
[SPEAKER_02]: efforts within the cannabis space and he
will offer his perspective on the market
[SPEAKER_02]: dynamics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have Professor Max Lung who
will be filling in on this interface
[SPEAKER_02]: between the environmental impacts of
cannabis and human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the format that I've put together for
today and I just have a handful of slides
[SPEAKER_02]: really more as condiments to the
discussion because it's really what our
[SPEAKER_02]: panelists have to offer on these topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, there really hasn't been any
systematic studies that have documented
[SPEAKER_02]: the human environmental impact of cannabis
until quite recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: There've been a couple of new publications
and the first bullet here has to do with a
[SPEAKER_02]: publication that came out of Colorado
State University which was the first
[SPEAKER_02]: attempt to actually quantitate the
greenhouse gas emissions from cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see we have some really
whopping numbers there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The equivalent of up to three million
cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'll also be able to address the air
pollution and odor again from the beach
[SPEAKER_02]: EVOCs, water waste and emerging issue for
this industry and particularly here in
[SPEAKER_02]: California is the single use plastics that
are so widespread within this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the additional waste of the throw away
of so much of the plant that's not used
[SPEAKER_02]: including the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll look at this human health
impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to start by asking each of
the panelists to while introducing
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves and telling us how they got
involved in the cannabis industry but to
[SPEAKER_02]: add comment on these topics for the
current state of the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: from their unique perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whichever one of you would like to
start the discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm David Traylor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks everybody for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sitting next to all these PhDs I feel
like that old Sesame Street song which one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these doesn't belong with the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so as she mentioned I have a degree,
science degree, got into biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 15 years operational experience in
biotech companies in Berlin, Boulder,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, Silicon Valley and then got on
investment banking in 2005 and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: started my own firm in 2012 doing
investment banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when Colorado and Washington
went legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started advising companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're the first investment bank in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: to advise cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also certainly we've spoken
actually around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our first Israeli client six years
ago in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've spoken on cannabis in Dubai,
Davos, during the World Economic Forum,
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankfurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sponsoring an event in Berlin this
year and then around the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my name is Maxwell Leung.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a new assistant professor from Arizona
State University.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My background is also quite unique
compared to other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually am a state regulatory
toxicologist working with the California
[SPEAKER_03]: department of pesticide regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also in support of the regulation with
the California cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my main interest is in two areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: One area is the impact of environmental
contaminants in medical use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So usually when people talk about
environmental impact they wouldn't think
[SPEAKER_03]: that, oh, okay, kill some animal down the
street, it has nothing to do with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cannabis is a sequestering plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that the environmental
contaminants in the environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: including pesticide, toxic elements,
and also microbial contaminant,
[SPEAKER_03]: it will be sequestered in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might actually affecting our use for
medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, another area that I'm very interested
in is the, what I call positive uses of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis activity for the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now there's this cousin of cannabis,
hemp, which contains very low level of
[SPEAKER_03]: TXC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now right now we, there's a lot of
research on the environmental impact,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm more interested in the
environmental application of, say,
[SPEAKER_03]: using hemp to remove contaminants from the
environment, a process we call
[SPEAKER_03]: phytoremediation, and also potentially
using hemp to capture CO2, something
[SPEAKER_03]: called carbon offset, you know,
process that have under a lot of interest
[SPEAKER_03]: is biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very excited to be here and talk to
you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my name's Ted Grantham.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a professor in the environmental
science policy and management department
[SPEAKER_06]: at UC Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_06]: And about five years ago, I was involved
in the establishment of a new research
[SPEAKER_06]: center at UC Berkeley called the Cannabis
Research Center.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it basically brought together a group
of faculty that were interested in
[SPEAKER_06]: different dimensions of cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think one of the, one of the other
distinguishing aspects of our center is
[SPEAKER_06]: that we're focusing much more on the
cultivation side and less on the sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: biomedical dimensions that are being
addressed in this conference.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we saw a real need to get a better
understanding of how cannabis is being
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivated in the state of California with
the passage of Prop 64 to ensure that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the policies that were being
developed, you know, made sense,
[SPEAKER_06]: made, you know, reflected reality on the
ground and we're going to be, ultimately
[SPEAKER_06]: be successful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we broadly, at the center, focus on the
sort of environmental, social,
[SPEAKER_06]: and policy dimensions of cannabis,
primarily focusing on California that we
[SPEAKER_06]: do collaborate with others outside of the
state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, as I mentioned,
we really study cannabis as an
[SPEAKER_06]: agricultural commodity, you know,
rather than, you know, a federally
[SPEAKER_06]: restricted drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our team includes, you know,
economists, ecologists, anthropologists,
[SPEAKER_06]: legal scholars.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually an ecologist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a biologist and hydrologist by
training.
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely an outlier here,
I think, but I'm really happy to be part
[SPEAKER_06]: of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to quickly comment on some of
our work around water in particular.
[SPEAKER_06]: When the state developed its regulations
around cannabis cultivation, there was a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of attention given to the use of
water, potential environmental impacts
[SPEAKER_06]: associated with water resources.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there had been some studies,
some sort of anecdotal evidence that
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis water use was having a negative
impact on some of the sensitive species we
[SPEAKER_06]: find in the state, like, you know,
some of the salmon and other sensitive
[SPEAKER_06]: species, particularly in Northern
California, which is the historical
[SPEAKER_06]: epicenter of cannabis cultivation in the
state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so for this reason, the state
developed very stringent requirements
[SPEAKER_06]: intended to mitigate potential impacts of
water use.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they really developed these policies
without actually knowing very much about
[SPEAKER_06]: how water was actually being used.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we saw a need to sort of fill this
knowledge gap and address very,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, I think fundamental questions,
basic questions around cannabis water use.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where does cannabis source their water?
[SPEAKER_06]: How much water are they using?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what context?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that vary by different
cultivation types, for example?
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, what are the environmental
impacts?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'll just briefly mention some of
the findings that we've, sort of developed
[SPEAKER_06]: over the, you know, realized over the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, first off, there's no evidence
that cannabis is a particularly thirsty
[SPEAKER_06]: crop, despite some portrayals in the
media.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at cannabis water use,
you know, per acre or whatever unit of
[SPEAKER_06]: area you want, it's really on par with
many other conventional agricultural
[SPEAKER_06]: crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have found, however, that there is
really substantial variation in water use
[SPEAKER_06]: by cultivators.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, in some cases, even orders of
magnitude for a given size.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there seems to be a lot of
variation in water use practices that we
[SPEAKER_06]: don't yet fully understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this really points to, I think,
a broader need, not just to water,
[SPEAKER_06]: but for really standardization and the
establishment of best management practices
[SPEAKER_06]: from everything from water to pesticide
use and other aspects of cultivation that
[SPEAKER_06]: just, that exists for pretty much every
other crop in the state and beyond.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not yet for California.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's two other comments.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, we found that, you know, when we look
at cannabis water use relative to all
[SPEAKER_06]: agricultural use in the state,
it's less than, you know, a fraction of
[SPEAKER_06]: 1%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a tiny volume of waters being used
for cannabis relative to all other crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will say there is still concern
about cannabis impacts in certain
[SPEAKER_06]: contexts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this can include some of the places in
Northern California, these smaller
[SPEAKER_06]: watersheds, where water is naturally quite
limited.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are the places where we might
expect to see potential for, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: for impact.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really all about context.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think in some cases, we've seen
sort of maybe an overestimation or
[SPEAKER_06]: portrayal of potential impacts.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in other cases, there are real causes
for concern that we'll continue to
[SPEAKER_06]: research.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll just maybe close by mentioning
that we're also studying a host of other
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of environmental dimensions of
cannabis, including wildlife and wildfire
[SPEAKER_06]: and greenhouse gas emissions and the nexus
of these concerns with state policy and
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I encourage you to check out our
research center and papers at,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, our website, which is again,
crc.berkeley.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I'm Will Vasuete.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a full professor of environmental
engineering at University of North
[SPEAKER_08]: Carolina in Chapel Hill.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in the School of Public Health there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're a bunch of engineers and
scientists interested in solving public
[SPEAKER_08]: health problems.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the public health problem I'm most
interested in solving is air quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the last 17 years or so,
I've been studying the connection between
[SPEAKER_08]: exposure to air quality and its connection
to human health.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the ways that we understand how
air pollution is formed in the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_08]: is understanding the interaction of
biogenic volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have called monoterpenes,
sesquiterpenes, and isoprene.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the biggest inputs from
terrestrial vegetation into the
[SPEAKER_08]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we don't understand the emissions
of those plants, we don't get a good sense
[SPEAKER_08]: of modeling for air pollution or our
exposure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what kind of brought me to this
field.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when I found out, oh, a decade or
so ago, there was going to be legalization
[SPEAKER_08]: in a lot of these states, I was just
curious.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought, well, I wonder what the
emissions of volatile organic compounds
[SPEAKER_08]: are from these cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: And is it in the magnitude in which that
could rival other industries and have an
[SPEAKER_08]: impact on regional air quality?
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I looked up the emission factors
for cannabis, there were none.
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely zero, because it's a federally
listed substance.
[SPEAKER_08]: The EPA, NOAA, NSF, all these federal
agencies that would normally be providing
[SPEAKER_08]: that information, which you could look up
for your car, you could look up for a gas
[SPEAKER_08]: station, did not exist at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I got some federal funding.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to fly out of North Carolina,
actually, and go to the National Center
[SPEAKER_08]: for Atmospheric Research in Colorado,
where this stuff was legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I published the very first paper on
emission factors, volatile compounds,
[SPEAKER_08]: the emissions of gases that come from
these plants while they're growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That spun up a few papers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also did a modeling study where we
modeled the entire cannabis industry as a
[SPEAKER_08]: whole in Denver to see its impact on air
quality in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: Since that time, I've done other studies
in Canada, in California.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's been difficult, as my academic
colleagues will probably attest to,
[SPEAKER_08]: to get federal funding to do any research
in this area.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I kind of abandoned it,
actually, in my academic research,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I spun up a company.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what Bioscientific is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so within Bioscientific, we use a lot
of the same methodology and scientific
[SPEAKER_08]: knowledge that we have from studying the
last 40 years all these other plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've now applied it to the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just some things that I found out is
actually quite fascinating.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cannabis plant is actually the most
fascinating plant I've ever studied in my
[SPEAKER_08]: entire life.
[SPEAKER_08]: And several other scientists have tested
it out as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you study tomatoes or pine trees or
these other things, you kind of get a
[SPEAKER_08]: profile of the emissions that they have.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we found with the cannabis plant
is that it varies widely by strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most folks probably already know that in
this room.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's really kind of unprecedented for
other plants to have such a wide variety
[SPEAKER_08]: of different profiles of kinds of
monoterpenes and amounts, depending on
[SPEAKER_08]: both strain and life cycle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which means that every facility that has
its own unique number of strains,
[SPEAKER_08]: a number of plants, actually has its own
unique profile of monoterpenes,
[SPEAKER_08]: sesquiterpenes that are being emitted out
of that facility into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that actually makes it very difficult
to assess and regulate and come up with an
[SPEAKER_08]: inventory that's accurate for the
cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing that we found was that not
just in the cultivation, i.e.
[SPEAKER_08]: in the vegetative and the flowering rooms,
but also post-harvest is a significant
[SPEAKER_08]: source of emissions of these biogenic
volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: The harvesting, especially if you're doing
mechanical trimming, tends to create a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of emissions of VOCs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you're trying to assess an
inventory of the total emission inventory
[SPEAKER_08]: into the atmosphere from cannabis
facilities, you not only have to include
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation, but you also have to include
both drying, post-processing, harvesting,
[SPEAKER_08]: all those other activities to really get a
sense of what the emissions are into the
[SPEAKER_08]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll end on, there's been a lot of
talk here about the benefits of
[SPEAKER_08]: monoterpenes and they certainly are
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing toxic that I've ever seen
about breathing in monoterpenes or
[SPEAKER_08]: sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens is when these monoterpenes
and sesquiterpenes enter the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_08]: they undergo oxidation, the same oxidation
process actually that we just saw in the
[SPEAKER_08]: previous talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: The hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere
oxidize these things and they turn into
[SPEAKER_08]: other things that are not nice,
formaldehyde, carbonyls, aldehydes,
[SPEAKER_08]: things that are not good for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they also produce ozone and
particulate matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: And ozone and particulate matter
specifically are the number one killers of
[SPEAKER_08]: air pollution exposure in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's not the actual VOCs
themselves, but the processed atmospheric
[SPEAKER_08]: chemistry that results in the ozone and PM
that they produce.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that could happen both in the indoor
environment as well as an outdoor
[SPEAKER_08]: environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that depends on a lot of other things
that allows us, which is why we run these
[SPEAKER_08]: models, to try to understand that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, I think we'll talk about odor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Odor is also a result of a gas phase
molecule that's coming from these plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And through our research at Bioscientific,
we're able to identify the odor molecule
[SPEAKER_08]: that's causing that skunky odor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And spoiler, it's not the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you all for your initial
comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So following this discussion, there are no
existing guidelines specifically for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis grow facilities, but I know a lot
of states, Colorado, California,
[SPEAKER_02]: are considering those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm curious what the panel thinks the
timeline will be until we see guidelines
[SPEAKER_02]: published at the state level for either
emissions, water effluent treatment or
[SPEAKER_02]: testing, and just general knowledge and
more oversight over the industry to
[SPEAKER_02]: monitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the issue with the volatiles,
so you can smell them, but you can't see
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever's going into the wastewater that
we don't really know, it goes to the water
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment facility, and they're not set up
to remove residual pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just curious what you
collectively think the timeline will be
[SPEAKER_02]: before we see restrictions being imposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I wanted to mention,
maybe it's a good thing for me to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of the history of cannabis and
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm uniquely qualified to talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, that I worked in bioprocessing,
two leading biotech companies in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two patents in bioprocessing from
the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at cannabis, that's what
cannabis is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a biological supply chain,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out I also was chief business
officer at Cerna, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first public companies in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cerna made climate control systems for
indoor grow operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at it, the history of
cultivation of cannabis, it can definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: get much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to answer my thought on Cindy's
question is, frankly, I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really going to be driven by regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be driven by economics,
and it's going to be driven by people not
[SPEAKER_00]: being so stupid frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can look it up there,
as quoted in Bloomberg one time,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been too much arrogance and too
little humility in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Case in point, there's a big LP out of
Canada that just recently closed their
[SPEAKER_00]: large cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out it wasn't because of oversupply,
it's because they sourced bad steel from
[SPEAKER_00]: China, and it was flaking off into the
product, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We also recently talked to a group out of
Cyprus that wants to use hydroponics to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow industrial hemp, which is probably
one of the dumbest ideas you've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what we believe is it's going
to be really starting to be driven by
[SPEAKER_00]: economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you guys have probably heard
we have indoor grow ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to probably start going
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be starting to do more
outdoor grow ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're also seeing a lot of
things being driven by what we call APT,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Alternative Production Technologies,
using E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, using yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using just chemistry, or even just doing
outdoor grow ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we believe that this industry and the
cultivation and the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids is really going to be driven
by the economics and the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: and frankly, less so, the regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to comment on the timeline for
environmental regulation in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there are two key factors here.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, if I go to Whole Foods to
buy a watermelon, I wouldn't expect the
[SPEAKER_03]: watermelon to be loaded with pesticide and
all the other contaminants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all the food, pharmaceutical of
course, but there are federal regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: that come to regulate, and most
importantly, make the information
[SPEAKER_03]: available for what is the level of
contaminants you would expect in that
[SPEAKER_03]: commodity.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we need to test for that
particular commodity?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the risks that are associated
with those exposure?
[SPEAKER_03]: With cannabinoids, that is non-existent at
the federal level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because cannabinoids is still regulated as
a schedule one substance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of those regulations,
because of that, it's not in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have US EPA, FDA, and all to
regulate this, because they basically
[SPEAKER_03]: treat that as illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, another aspect, I will agree with the
other panelists here about the comment on
[SPEAKER_03]: the importance of the industry to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you think about it,
right now, cannabis contaminant regulation
[SPEAKER_03]: is done on the basis of state-by-state
regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, if different states,
there's no communication between them,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no interaction with the industry
across multiple states.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not going to change unless we
actually have federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the interaction between the
industry and also different stakeholder at
[SPEAKER_03]: the state, the analytical chemistry is key
to the timeline for environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'll just speak to the California
perspective and start with the recognition
[SPEAKER_06]: that cannabis is subject currently to the
most stringent environmental requirements
[SPEAKER_06]: of any agricultural crop in the state.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that I'm sure many folks in this
room are well aware of.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so while I think there is a need to
establish standardized practices and
[SPEAKER_06]: guidelines to address environmental
impacts, I don't think it actually would
[SPEAKER_06]: be very wise for the state to impose new
restrictions on cannabis, particularly
[SPEAKER_06]: given the challenges that the state is
already facing in bringing growers into
[SPEAKER_06]: the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that we've commented on
and written extensively about are the fact
[SPEAKER_06]: that there are just substantial barriers
to compliance for growers associated with
[SPEAKER_06]: the regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the environment is part of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some issues with water where I
think policy improvement might help lower
[SPEAKER_06]: those barriers to compliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know there's been some discussion of
those sort of market forces, but also
[SPEAKER_06]: issues related to local control.
[SPEAKER_06]: In particular, that I think are really
getting in the way of a successful legal
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess I'll just say while I think
there is a need to standardize and develop
[SPEAKER_06]: guidelines to address potential
environmental impacts, I think the best
[SPEAKER_06]: path forward in the short term would be
through voluntary certificate programs,
[SPEAKER_06]: for example, that would encourage growers
to use best practices and signals to
[SPEAKER_06]: consumers that best practices are being
used rather than by taking a regulatory
[SPEAKER_06]: approach.
[SPEAKER_08]: You had great comments from my panelists
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll speak specifically to two
subjects.
[SPEAKER_08]: One is air quality and the other is odor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Air quality is kind of a brighter picture.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, folks are, you're asking when
regulations happen, it's happening now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time there goes a license comes up,
they're asking for environmental
[SPEAKER_08]: assessments.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now luckily, we have the tools and
technologies and methods to assess air
[SPEAKER_08]: quality from this industry or any other
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: The issue with this industry is that we
are missing those emission factors.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I was opening up a gas station,
I could look up an emission factor for
[SPEAKER_08]: decreasing an engine.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could put it into existing regulatory
models.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see if that passes the regulatory
permit or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything exists for that for the
cannabis industry except for the emission
[SPEAKER_08]: factor, which is what we've been trying to
focus on for the past.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it important to run those models to
do those systems to understand where
[SPEAKER_08]: there's an air quality impact?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do those systems already exist?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's missing is just the data.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we would have that data if EPA was
studying this stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now on the odor side, it's a little
different.
[SPEAKER_08]: There aren't really any standards for odor
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so most folks when they're trying to
issue licenses, they're saying we don't
[SPEAKER_08]: ever want to have an odor, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're even further behind in that than
we are on air quality as far as how to
[SPEAKER_08]: mitigate it, understanding what's even
causing the odor or in the inherent
[SPEAKER_08]: subjectivity of that odor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so how we're trying to approach it in
bioscientific is now that we've identified
[SPEAKER_08]: the molecule that's causing that odor,
we have engineered all our molecular
[SPEAKER_08]: capture systems to specifically go after
the standards because we know what the
[SPEAKER_08]: molecule is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the hope is to have a zero impact
odor as far as that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But these things are happening now and
until we get some federal legalization and
[SPEAKER_08]: some help from the federal government,
it's going to be ad hoc county by county,
[SPEAKER_08]: state by state, and it's going to be
difficult and it's going to create
[SPEAKER_08]: barriers to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really sort of drilling down on this
same topic on lack of federal oversight
[SPEAKER_02]: and as patchwork of state regulations,
the focus has been turning to
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainability in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: The city of Denver has established a
cannabis sustainability group and they've
[SPEAKER_02]: actually published a document,
which is pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And clearly I think the industry is on a
path to adopting more sustainability
[SPEAKER_02]: measures, but there are barriers to that,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just talked about lack of
regulations or need of regulations,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's also the need for innovation
and alternative technologies and maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: incentives and maybe the incentives are
economic largely, whether through the cost
[SPEAKER_02]: of additional imposed regulations or just
through consumer demand for the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: to become more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I bring up this issue of single use
plastics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these requirements for packaging for
child resistant containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to ask the panel their
thoughts on how quickly or what are the
[SPEAKER_02]: barriers for sustainability?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the sustainability for the
cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think again, it's probably going to be
more driven by economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I think one of the big
questions that we see is what is
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation going to be in the future and
where is it going to be located,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for example, you have,
I mean, we are in LA, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm from Colorado and a lot of our
water from Colorado goes to the LA
[SPEAKER_00]: aqueduct, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we have, as we pointed out on
the panel before, we haven't really solved
[SPEAKER_00]: the water problem and that's a big
sustainability issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that in mind, I think probably
cultivation is going to move to places
[SPEAKER_00]: that are more amenable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, to us, there's two big
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geography and we look at this as a global
perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked to operators that want to
grow in the Canary Islands and they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow in Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jersey Islands, Greece, Lesotho in
South Africa, Columbia, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is that going to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Columbia, everybody assumed that
that was going to be the solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing because you can grow year round,
it's in the equator, but it turns out a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the public companies down there
have got their clocks cleaned,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then getting back to the alternative
production technologies, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, Demetrius I believe is a
sponsor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, you know, we're talking to a
company actually in South Carolina that's
[SPEAKER_00]: generating APIs, active pharmaceutical
ingredients from a phytosource from
[SPEAKER_00]: actually cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other question is, you know,
where's that going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And our belief is that the way the
production of cannabis in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: or cannabinoids, let's just put it that
way, is going to be driven by the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to make the highest quality molecules,
full stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that involves a phytosource or an
alternative production technology or
[SPEAKER_00]: combination thereof, we believe that's
where it's headed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the biggest challenge related to
sustainability is that we need to start
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking about the environmental impact of
cannabis to the environmental application
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for instance, I talk about the
potential of using hemp to remove
[SPEAKER_03]: contaminants from the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also opportunity to use it as a
tool for carbon offset.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those research, because for both
cannabis and hemp, both of them have just
[SPEAKER_03]: been legalized to grow in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: So more focus on how do we actually use it
in addition to, you know, like how does it
[SPEAKER_03]: cause the environment, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And other elements, farm waste,
you know, also what do we do with farm
[SPEAKER_03]: waste?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we figure out how to do it with the
process of biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: That can turn out to be a process with
capturing CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thinking about the application side,
you know, as well as the impact side is
[SPEAKER_03]: key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another part I want to talk about is we
need a better understanding with the
[SPEAKER_03]: biology of the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, if we were thinking about
growing cannabis, you know, in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of the production is in the
in-house.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're thinking about growing it
outdoor, right now we don't have a string
[SPEAKER_03]: of either cannabis or hemp that are
selected specifically to grow in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do it chrome by chrome, but once you
take it outside the control environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: where would we get productivity out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, very little information about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, this is actually one of my key
research questions because for me,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I'm wanting to use hemp to remove
environmental pollutants, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: toxic elements in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we even grow hemp?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where should we put it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very little information is available right
now, and one of the things that we do know
[SPEAKER_03]: is that we are not actually having the
right biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have it out of this particular
crop option yet for it to grow well in our
[SPEAKER_03]: state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a better understanding of the
biology of the crop is also key if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: used with sustainability.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'll just offer the perspective
that I think the potential for
[SPEAKER_06]: sustainability in the cannabis industry
sort of relies entirely on the viability
[SPEAKER_06]: of the legal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, you know, federal
legalization is really the only,
[SPEAKER_06]: is the primary sort of obstacle,
I think, to a viable market.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think there's still a lot that the
state can do to lower barriers,
[SPEAKER_06]: to access, to help the system work more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there are certainly issues related
to sort of financial barriers,
[SPEAKER_06]: the taxation that occurs from local state
to state levels from cultivation to
[SPEAKER_06]: distribution that can certainly be
addressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that we found in our
research is that there seems to be a,
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of a geographic and scale transition
in where and how cannabis is being grown
[SPEAKER_06]: in California, away from sort of small
scale production, again, primarily in the
[SPEAKER_06]: North Coast, but in other parts of the
state as well, to larger scale production,
[SPEAKER_06]: predominantly in the Central Coast and
areas a little bit closer to consumer
[SPEAKER_06]: centers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this isn't necessarily a bad or a good
thing, but I'll just say that one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: original intents of Prop 64 was to help
transition these sort of historical legacy
[SPEAKER_06]: grows into the legal market and sort of
preserve the sort of the potential for
[SPEAKER_06]: small scale farming to be viable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's really critical when we
think about the sustainability of the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry and the way that cannabis is
being grown in the state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there seems to be signs that we may be
moving towards more sort of models of
[SPEAKER_06]: industrial agriculture for cannabis
cultivation that has well known negative
[SPEAKER_06]: environmental, you know, social economic
impacts.
[SPEAKER_06]: That I think should be concerned for
anyone trying to move this industry
[SPEAKER_06]: towards a more sustainable practice.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great always being last on these
panels, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to think of something to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, the thing about
sustainability from my standpoint is focus
[SPEAKER_08]: on community air pollution, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Their exposure.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a cultivation in a community,
you want to be a good community neighbor,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to be producing air
pollution, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Also community health, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: The workers that are working in these
facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they're exposed to, we're also
interested in.
[SPEAKER_08]: But also energy usage, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're going to be filtrating out
these chemicals that are being emitted by
[SPEAKER_08]: the plants, you want to be able to design
a filtration system that takes out just
[SPEAKER_08]: enough and not too much, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to over-design and you
don't want to under-design.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm trained as a chemical engineer
and I've always been taught that you need
[SPEAKER_08]: data to understand the problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that's one of the barriers
that we have to developing the solutions
[SPEAKER_08]: and technological as well as legal
solutions for these problems is our lack
[SPEAKER_08]: of data.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're trying to address that in
Bioscientific where we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_08]: gas phase emissions from these plants to
understand exactly how much is being
[SPEAKER_08]: emitted by these plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then we can design systems that exactly
breathe that in what the plants are
[SPEAKER_08]: breathing out.
[SPEAKER_08]: No more and no less.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also have a sense of how much of molecules
are coming out of the odor molecules.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have those and you can use models
to see where things are going,
[SPEAKER_08]: to see where hotspots are occurring,
and you can assess the efficacy of your
[SPEAKER_08]: controls.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think in addition to what my
panelists have said, I think having data,
[SPEAKER_08]: scientific data is critical and it's one
of the big gaps in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the ways industries move
forward is through innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I started this list two
years ago for this panel and of course now
[SPEAKER_02]: LED lighting is so common and in some
states lighting requirements are in place,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: A movement again to move away from the
wastefulness of this industry where the
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporation of living soil systems where
you're not throwing away your growing
[SPEAKER_02]: matrix every year and it also saves on
energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know, I think there is a
need for monitoring influence that are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out of grows, I mean, we have
really no idea about the concentration of
[SPEAKER_02]: certain chemicals that are widely used
within these large-scale grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Professor Vissuetti has already
talked to us about volatiles and odor
[SPEAKER_02]: mitigation, but I think that's becoming
way more standardized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as we're going down this
list is more recent innovations.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I recently learned about
is recycling of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a company in Austin,
Texas, I can't remember their name of
[SPEAKER_02]: course, but they came up with this idea of
capturing CO2 from local breweries and
[SPEAKER_02]: compressing it and then making it
available to cannabis grow facilities that
[SPEAKER_02]: normally do use CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's happening now in Colorado as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, what a great simple
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for me, the most interesting new
concept I learned about is called cold
[SPEAKER_02]: plasma fertilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plasma is like what exists on the
surface of the sun and sometime it's
[SPEAKER_02]: referred to as a fourth state of matter,
but it has been shown to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: deposit nitrogen locally just where it's
needed in a cropping system rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: flooding your plants with excessive
amounts of nutrients that again end up in
[SPEAKER_02]: the effluent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious if the panel members have
heard of any innovative trends on the
[SPEAKER_02]: horizon for this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how it might help preserve the
longevity of indoor growing of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, indoor and maybe even outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a couple of interesting things just
we've heard recently, we have hopefully a
[SPEAKER_00]: client we're going to sign up this week
looking at LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They essentially did a study right before
the pandemic hit in Brazil where they were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually supplementing outdoor cultivation
with cannabis and some other plants using
[SPEAKER_00]: LED and saw actually increasing yield by
supplementing the natural ambient light
[SPEAKER_00]: with LED lighting, which I thought was
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another company we just
talked to out of Colorado that is
[SPEAKER_00]: generating terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think I mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our belief is this, and especially you
folks that believe in the entourage effect
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to hate me, but we believe this
is all going towards molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you saw Dr. Smellman's talk
yesterday about emergent behavior and
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity, we need to be smarter about
deconstructing what molecules do what,
[SPEAKER_00]: which cannabinoids are valuable for which
indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so getting to this company in
Colorado, they're using hop sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: effluent from breweries, to generate
terpenes, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a cheap way to do it,
much cheaper than indoor grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for example, I don't know if
you've heard about the company right now
[SPEAKER_00]: that's growing hemp outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're concentrating it down to a CBD
extract, and then they're doing a common
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical conversion from CBD to THC,
delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not even doing this under
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it gets to the point where
technology is, I believe, going to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: where this industry goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a lot to offer regarding
indoor farming, but I do want to speak
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically on the farm waste management
of the cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So growing cannabis produce a lot of farms
where you harvest the part that is useful,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the other part you have to find a
way to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do contain, some of them do contain
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the usual practice is you just send it
to a disposal site, but there are
[SPEAKER_03]: different use for different parts of
cannabis as a crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: One way to do it is, okay, let's just see
if we can make dual purpose crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get the THC component out,
and then you can also get fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now another way to do it is that you can
actually use cannabis as a crop in farm
[SPEAKER_03]: waste management for CO2 capture.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea is that if you think about the
crop, most of that, the ones that are not
[SPEAKER_03]: useful are cellulose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not really a very good chemical
composition for carbon capturing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one way that you can deal with it is
that now in Arizona, we have a lot of sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have farm waste, and then one
possibility is you can leverage the solar
[SPEAKER_03]: energy that we have to convert the farm
waste into biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So biochar is charcoal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's to basically make all the component
not bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not only that you remove the THC,
but you also remove the capture,
[SPEAKER_03]: the carbon along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the only thing I can offer with
indoor farming.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't have much to offer here
either.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just mention briefly on water use in
particular.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there are certainly a lot of
innovation happening in the water space
[SPEAKER_06]: around efficient irrigation, but I think
it really points back to an earlier topic
[SPEAKER_06]: around the question of setting standards
and the absence of standards around
[SPEAKER_06]: certainly irrigation requirements,
but also other cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_06]: And without a benchmark, it's difficult
to, I think, create incentives for
[SPEAKER_06]: implementing the types of innovative
technologies that are coming on online.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of the things that I'm looking
around and some of the work that we're
[SPEAKER_08]: doing actually, since we are able to
completely fingerprint every single strain
[SPEAKER_08]: that we come across, we've been toying
with the idea of using that as a marker to
[SPEAKER_08]: identify whether you really have the
strain that you think you have,
[SPEAKER_08]: or also to check your clones, to make sure
you have the right clones before you have
[SPEAKER_08]: to wait until they're fully grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: So using the gas phase emission as a
fingerprint is an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing that we've been looking at
that's been pretty novel and very recent
[SPEAKER_08]: actually is this odor issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have identified a thiol molecule
that does that, but it's not just the
[SPEAKER_08]: amount of thiol.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually its interaction with the
monoturpenes that leads to odor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a really interesting dynamic
that we're trying to study there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then lastly, a lot is going toward
having kind of a clean environment for
[SPEAKER_08]: both your workers, as well as for the
cultivation of your plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in addition to our molecular
filtration, as well as our waterless vapor
[SPEAKER_08]: phase capture, we're also doing closed
ionization for electrostatic capture and
[SPEAKER_08]: deactivation of viruses and molds and
spores, in addition to capturing a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: particulate matter all the way down to the
ultrafine size, so these nano-sized
[SPEAKER_08]: particles.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that combined with charcoal filtration
and the vapor phase really attacks all the
[SPEAKER_08]: different things our folks and your plants
could be exposed to.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, all this wouldn't have been
possible without understanding from a
[SPEAKER_08]: molecular level what's going on and being
emitted from these plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing what you can do with just a
little bit of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, great, great comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in spite of all of these innovations
and optimistic outlook, we still have
[SPEAKER_02]: significant challenges ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't list on here, but I should
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one is the disconnect at the
federal level.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we didn't have these arbitrary
geographic boundaries between states,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would solve a lot of the
issues, mainly that cannabis could be
[SPEAKER_02]: grown outdoors where it could be grown at
a cheaper cost, and certainly places like
[SPEAKER_02]: Las Vegas that have a horrible shortage
and scarcity of water from the Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: River is not a good place to be growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just will highlight some of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I keep harping on the single-use
plastic waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water scarcity, which is going to be
increasing issue for all of us across the
[SPEAKER_02]: globe.
[SPEAKER_02]: The increasing costs, I mean, running any
cannabis operation is incredibly
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing costs, licensing, all the waste
that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all parts of this plant could be
utilized instead of ground up and mixed
[SPEAKER_02]: with concrete and hauled to the dump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, there hasn't been a detailed
study addressing the exposure of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: workers who are inside these facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's been mentioned a little here
by the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, on the health and medical side,
we know so little about dosing and how
[SPEAKER_02]: these various phytoactive chemicals are
interacting together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a growing industry,
which is the production of specific
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids in vitro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being fermented in yeast and I
tried to get someone from one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: companies on the panel because I think
we'll start seeing an impact from that,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly as this industry matures and
there's more pharmaceutical companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: become interested where they want to have
very defined amounts of different
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids or specific cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be much easier to just acquire it
from one of these companies because you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to worry about the presence of
any residual cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like currently, you can't really say that
something is THC-free if it's made from
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis because there's no safe harbor
quantitative level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it all comes down to,
in the final, go around for our panelists
[SPEAKER_02]: who've been great, is how sustainable is
indoor grown cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to me, it gets down to two things,
direct economic impact and doing the right
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, as you guys probably heard,
in December 30th, we had that terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: fire in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter goes to school up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to school there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having that happen, and I was born and
raised in Colorado, to have that happen
[SPEAKER_00]: December 30th in a fire like that is just
absolutely mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fire was so hot, they're having to
rewire the cables that were buried three
[SPEAKER_00]: feet below the ground because it got so
damn hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that stuff starts happening,
and I think you guys would agree,
[SPEAKER_00]: global climate change is going to get
addressed when people start getting direct
[SPEAKER_00]: economic impact, like their land in
Florida starts going underwater and people
[SPEAKER_00]: start doing something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, like getting back,
we've talked to a group out of Mongolia
[SPEAKER_00]: that's growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going back to its roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine, there's probably not many
better places to grow cannabis than
[SPEAKER_00]: Mongolia with economics, everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing I want to just really
quickly add, doing the right thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys would agree that if
you're in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, my daughter or my wife's
family are big oil people, and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me that there's not a difference in
culture between cannabis and oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people I know, having been in
cannabis as long as I have, are interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in the environment and doing the right
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to speak on it from the perspective
of urban farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the projects that I have done at
Arizona State University is to look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: location of the cannabis and hemp farm in
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that I found is that
when you're building a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_03]: then of course the growing environment in
Arizona is very different from California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ended up seeing a lot of farms,
big indoor farms that are located right in
[SPEAKER_03]: the middle of the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they actually go right along the
highway, which is really interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: because I know you guys are working on
geospatial analysis too, and you have the
[SPEAKER_03]: satellite imaging analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we found out that the best way to
pick those out in Arizona is not the farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the air conditioner on top of the
building.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing that I want to, it's quite
amusing actually what we found,
[SPEAKER_03]: but one thing that I want to speak on is
that when we talk about urban farming,
[SPEAKER_03]: you talk about greenhouse, you talk about
hydroponic, but how about in urban farming
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it kind of go back to the biology?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put a cannabis sativa in the field
in Arizona climate, would it actually
[SPEAKER_03]: grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, what kind of selective breeding do
we need?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it actually be a viable solution?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say, I have colleagues in the U of A
extension that are working on leafy green
[SPEAKER_03]: of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: That can be an option for urban farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alternatively, if that doesn't work,
then we also can use a hemp, again,
[SPEAKER_03]: for vital remediation, pull some of the
pollutant out, then you can grow other
[SPEAKER_03]: things in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's one area that I would be
very interested to research in more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess I'll just revisit a point I
made earlier that I think that the
[SPEAKER_06]: sustainability of the cannabis industry
really depends on our ability to create
[SPEAKER_06]: viable paths for small-scale outdoor
growers to exist and thrive in the legal
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are obviously major market
forces that make that path difficult,
[SPEAKER_06]: but there are also a lot of, I think,
regulatory policy changes that could be
[SPEAKER_06]: made to reduce barriers and to support
that particular segment of the cultivation
[SPEAKER_06]: matrix.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question of indoor cannabis and
whether it's sustainable, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: it really depends on how you define
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at the energy intensity,
I will say there haven't been any great
[SPEAKER_06]: studies that have, to my knowledge,
that have done sort of a fair
[SPEAKER_06]: apples-to-apples comparison of indoor to
outdoor in a California context,
[SPEAKER_06]: at least.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's hard to justify investing in
really large-scale indoor cultivation in a
[SPEAKER_06]: place like California, where outdoor
cultivation is such an obvious
[SPEAKER_06]: alternative, given especially the state's
goals for greenhouse gas, gas reduction,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that may be an unpopular sentiment,
but happy to speak with you all after
[SPEAKER_06]: about that topic, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, all interesting things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer to this question,
it depends, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on how you define
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on how you operate these
facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've visited probably dozens of different
kinds of facilities in at least three or
[SPEAKER_08]: four different states, and it's amazing
how different everyone does this.
[SPEAKER_08]: HVAC systems are completely different,
filtration's different, humidity's
[SPEAKER_08]: different, soils that you use is
different, and all those different
[SPEAKER_08]: variables affect energy uses, affect
relative humidity, affect temperature,
[SPEAKER_08]: affect all these other variables that go
into this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I'm right, there's not enough
data available to say how, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: how do these things compare to other
activities when it comes to energy,
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticide use, and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can say from an air pollution
standpoint, if we're talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: sustainability, indoor grows are probably
easier to control because it's an indoor
[SPEAKER_08]: enclosed environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can much easier be able to capture any
molecules that are leaving the facility in
[SPEAKER_08]: an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether that's better from the other
standpoints of unsustainability,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's a different question, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it easier to control air pollution in
indoor grow than outdoor grow?
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to that is indoor grows easier.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, can you do it in an outdoor grow?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have lots of different kinds of
technologies that allow us to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a possibility as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think when it comes down to
sustainability, it's going to come down to
[SPEAKER_08]: energy usage and water usage, I think are
the two things that folks should be
[SPEAKER_08]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a few minutes left.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody out there has a question for
any of our panelists, this would be an
[SPEAKER_02]: opportune time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I saw folks standing earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now's your time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name's Cameron, and I am a legacy
cultivator, and I have the very first
[SPEAKER_05]: permitted cannabis farm in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grow using permaculture and
regenerative farming practices in the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil, and I find myself spending more and
more time at board of supervisors
[SPEAKER_05]: meetings, especially over the last five
years, having to go up against,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have large NIMBY and not in my backyard
groups, and they are really driving
[SPEAKER_05]: policies specifically in Sonoma County,
and we have people showing up to every
[SPEAKER_05]: meeting talking about one water usage,
which thank you for putting that paper
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We quote you all the time at board of
supervisors meetings, but one of the big
[SPEAKER_05]: comments is we have people saying that the
terpenes from our cannabis is making them
[SPEAKER_05]: sick, and we're allowed to grow 10,000
square feet, and we're outdoors,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I would like to be able to know what
does the science say about the terpenes
[SPEAKER_05]: making neighbors a mile down the road
sick?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a great question,
and that's something I've looked into
[SPEAKER_08]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there have been studies looking at
worker exposure to monoturpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the largest exposures of
monoturpenes is pine workers, or pine saw,
[SPEAKER_08]: sawing pine in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_08]: They see parts per million, so orders of
magnitude higher concentrations of alpha
[SPEAKER_08]: pining, eight hours a day, every day,
for decades.
[SPEAKER_08]: They followed those workers, looked at all
their public health stuff for those
[SPEAKER_08]: workers, and found out a single
toxological effect from being exposed to
[SPEAKER_08]: alpha pining at levels that are orders of
magnitude higher than what you would find
[SPEAKER_08]: in the ambient environment, at exposure
times that are eight hours a day,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the terpenes themselves have
absolutely no toxic effect on humans.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've evolved with these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We love the smell of alpha pining and that
pine smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've evolved as human beings to like
those.
[SPEAKER_08]: The issue with the terpenes is that when
they react in the atmosphere with a source
[SPEAKER_08]: of combustion like a car or NOx sources in
sunlight, they react and form ozone and
[SPEAKER_08]: they form particulate matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those things are not good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, does it always form that?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, it's very complicated,
which is why we run these air quality
[SPEAKER_08]: monitors.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to give you a quick example,
if I put something in downtown Denver,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is high desert and low VOCs,
that could impact ozone.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if I put it in Carpinteria,
where there's an ocean of biogenic VOCs
[SPEAKER_08]: already there, adding a can of Sicily has
absolutely negligible impact.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell folks in California,
you're being exposed to those terpenes
[SPEAKER_08]: every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you peel an orange, you get more
exposure to those VOCs than you do
[SPEAKER_08]: anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I could talk to you after too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cameron actually asked the question that I
was going to ask as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am from Massachusetts and I think
the question was presented at the
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning of the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do any states have regulations on energy
usage?
[SPEAKER_04]: Massachusetts does.
[SPEAKER_04]: They address the light power density of a
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which we have to deal with and abide by to
some extent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're trying to, in some ways,
pressure people to be more sustainable,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least with respect to lighting,
if not HVAC.
[SPEAKER_04]: But part of the problem there is they've
also released outdoor licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our company has a greenhouse as well as an
outdoor grow license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the microbe thresholds is the problem
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the experts that were talking about how
much energy usage we should be having did
[SPEAKER_04]: not speak with the experts who were
talking about microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So total yeast and mold count.
[SPEAKER_04]: They talk about three bacteria in
particular.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then total yeast and mold is so
prohibitive that you can't possibly grow
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoors and sell that flower without
radiating and or doing something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an interesting model that I would
encourage you to check out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come take a visit with me if you'd like
and see what we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could hear there was a question there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Energy usage, I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so the question mainly was what the
regulations on energy are, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: On energy usage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Also over energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well real quick from my perspective
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy usage went way up and then a
lot of these things are going out of
[SPEAKER_00]: business, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a big bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Excel will start to give
rebates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also a lawsuit in I think it was
Colorado Springs where somebody sued Groop
[SPEAKER_00]: because of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the plaintiff, the people that
got the smell ended up losing that
[SPEAKER_00]: lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean odor is a real issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear it from communities all the time
about the odor issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm telling you, we don't know a lot
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know a lot how to mitigate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean prior to us discovering that
molecule, everybody, if you talk to most
[SPEAKER_08]: of the individuals, they thought
monoterpenes were causing the skunky odor.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's even companies out there who
monitor monoterpenes to make sure your
[SPEAKER_08]: odor is OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we've seen is you can have an
anti-correlation because that's not the
[SPEAKER_08]: molecule that's driving the odor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so both in the science and
understanding what's driving the odor,
[SPEAKER_08]: but also on the subjectivity side,
everybody has a subjective way to do odor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these nasal rangers, forget about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no precision in that whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only precision you can get for odor is
using an odor panel, which is a much
[SPEAKER_08]: different thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a wild west out there when it
comes to odor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're trying to bring some data into
the equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a really quick comment to the
gentleman from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, of course, growing cannabis in
Arizona is very different from
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you from one of my projects,
I actually looked into hemp growth in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Yuma County in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really hot there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to say, when it gets hot and
you're growing hemp outside, it smells
[SPEAKER_03]: really bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is so bad that the farmer in Yuma
County, they have to kind of hide from
[SPEAKER_03]: their labor because you just drive past
the highway.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got this block of smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you just look at your labor and
say, oh my god, I'm growing hemp in my
[SPEAKER_03]: farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can totally agree with what you're
just saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what's interesting with that is,
and we'll let the next person question it,
[SPEAKER_08]: is when it's hotter, it's probably not
because there's more of those sulfur
[SPEAKER_08]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be that there's more dilution and
more reactivity of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the terpenes go away, revealing the
thiol, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've been in a cannabis facility and
you go inside, most of you probably don't
[SPEAKER_08]: smell that skunky smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: You open a door and you go five feet away.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of a sudden, it hits you like a wall.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because of the ratio of those
emissions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really a fascinating subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, your question, ma'am?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use ma'am anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'm having a really hard time hearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that was a little bit of a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Firstly, my name is Sharon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a very interesting topic
because sustainability of our planet is
[SPEAKER_01]: really the number one key topic that all
humans need to address if we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay here or end up on Mars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to address the aromatic
principles that the last gentleman had
[SPEAKER_01]: brought up with regard to odor and odor
abatement.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpene, the terpenes, when they are
isolated or alone and you smell them,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not really that exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: So littoral, which is the predominant
terpene in lavender, you extract that and
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't smell anything like lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lavender has over 625 plus metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what makes that aromatic blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is related as an herb,
has its odor profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two classes of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did mention the thiols.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mercaptans and the pyrazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not much that's mentioned about
the pyrazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is something that is quite
problematic to a lot of humans that cause
[SPEAKER_01]: a headache and causes fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually going over on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is actually to address that in
terms of the odor abatement and what
[SPEAKER_01]: you've found to be significant to capture
the byproducts after they're emitted into
[SPEAKER_01]: the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we rely a lot on molecular filtration
for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are able to analyze the gas
molecules that come off the plant and
[SPEAKER_08]: identify mostly thiols, a group of thiols
and other sulfur containing compounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: We then are able to synthesize or buy a
standard of that specific molecule and
[SPEAKER_08]: then engineer our controls to capture
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a real good efficiency of
capturing these sulfur molecules.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the problem with the odor is
that nobody's going to give us a part per
[SPEAKER_08]: billion odor detection threshold for any
of these sulfur compounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: There isn't one that exists.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so currently we're trying to engineer
to capture every single sulfur compound.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if it has a sulfur compound,
we're able to capture it and make sure it
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't leave the facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that includes all the sulfur
compounds, even the ones that may have
[SPEAKER_08]: tagging out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about the pyrazine molecule.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to go back and check to see if
that's actually emitted by that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember seeing that on the list,
but I can check on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are actually out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we've gone over our time
allotment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have other questions, you could
come up here, but before you go,
[SPEAKER_02]: please help me thank our panelists who
have provided us with such an interesting
[SPEAKER_07]: talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
