[SPEAKER_00]: So good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the title of my presentation is Does
Marijuana Smoking Increase the Risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: Dementia?
[SPEAKER_00]: When considering treatment with any
therapeutic agent, one must always balance
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit against risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regarding marijuana, its smoke
contains most of the same ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: found in tobacco smoke, many of which are
known to be toxic to lung tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that tobacco is the major risk
factor by virtue of exposure of the lung
[SPEAKER_00]: to these toxic components within the smoke
to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
[SPEAKER_00]: and lung cancer, both of which account for
considerable morbidity and mortality
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for some time, there has been concern
that marijuana, because it shares the most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ingredients, the toxic ingredients
contained within tobacco smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: might actually pose similar respiratory
risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the weight of evidence thus far
does not support a significant association
[SPEAKER_00]: between marijuana smoking, even heavy
marijuana smoking, and these two
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory complications of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, there is another
tobacco-related respiratory risk,
[SPEAKER_00]: namely community-acquired pneumonia,
25% of the cases of which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: attributed to tobacco smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 1.4 million deaths due to
pneumonia worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, there is little
information concerning the possibility
[SPEAKER_00]: that marijuana smoking might also
predispose to pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the objective of a study
that we have conducted, the results of
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm going to be presenting today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to begin with a brief
discussion of the biologic plausibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: there being a risk of marijuana for
pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we performed bronchoscopy on a large
number of smokers of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were regular, generally heavy smokers
of marijuana alone or with tobacco,
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco smokers alone and non-smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we obtained biopsies at various sites
in the lower respiratory tract and found
[SPEAKER_00]: that in contrast to the normal
bronchomucosa, and here we see the nice
[SPEAKER_00]: ciliated columnar epithelial cells that
line the larger airways, these were
[SPEAKER_00]: largely destroyed and replaced by
mucus-secreting surface epithelial cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called goblet cells, as well as other
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this then resulted in an increased
production of mucus from these cells with
[SPEAKER_00]: a limited capacity of the lung to clear
the mucus out of the lung because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: associated ciliary loss, so that this
excess accumulated mucus could serve as a
[SPEAKER_00]: culture medium for pathogenic bacteria and
predispose to pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a matter of fact, there are
observational studies, carefully conducted
[SPEAKER_00]: observational studies that do show an
association between increased mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: production and marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now alveolar macrophages are the primary
immune effector cells that reside in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lung, and they serve a very important
function to protect the lung against
[SPEAKER_00]: infection when they're stimulated by
bacteria or other microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they release toxic products,
including reactive oxygen species,
[SPEAKER_00]: nitric oxide, et cetera, that kill the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to look at the function of
alveolar macrophages harvested from the
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs of marijuana smokers, and so we used
the technique of bronchial alveolar lavage
[SPEAKER_00]: through the bronchoscope to rinse the
cells out of the lung so that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: examine their function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we compared macrophages obtained from
marijuana smokers with those obtained from
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco-only smokers, combined smokers of
marijuana tobacco, and nonsmokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found, these are old studies,
but they're still valid, that the
[SPEAKER_00]: macrophages from the marijuana smokers,
relative to those from tobacco smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: were impaired in their ability to release
the reactive oxygen species when
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were also impaired in their ability
to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines,
[SPEAKER_00]: the TNFL for IL-6, GMCSF, that play a very
important role in up-regulating inducible
[SPEAKER_00]: nitric oxide synthase, which is the enzyme
that converts arginine to nitric oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned before, nitric oxide is
one of the effector molecules that are
[SPEAKER_00]: important in killing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cultured the macrophages obtained
from the marijuana smokers with pathogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterium staph aureus, we also did
similar studies with fungi, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at the, waited a while,
and looked at the ability of these
[SPEAKER_00]: macrophages to kill the bacteria on the
upper curve here, represents the curve
[SPEAKER_00]: from the macrophages obtained from
marijuana smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bacteria remaining, so the
shallower the curve, the less the killing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see an impaired ability of
macrophages from marijuana smokers to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, compared to macrophages from
nonsmokers, and also from tobacco smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a little complex slide,
so I'll go through it a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white circles represent nitric,
represent bacterial killing, and the white
[SPEAKER_00]: bars represent nitric oxide production,
ignore the black circles and bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see again that the bacterial
killing by the macrophages and the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana smokers is impaired,
in parallel with an impairment in nitric
[SPEAKER_00]: oxide production.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we added a cytokine, GMCSF,
exogenously we restored nitric oxide
[SPEAKER_00]: production, and at the same time restored
the bacterial killing capacity of these
[SPEAKER_00]: macrophages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the clinical evidence that
marijuana use might be a risk factor
[SPEAKER_00]: predisposing to pneumonia?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are older case series of fungal
pneumonia in marijuana smokers
[SPEAKER_00]: immunocompromised by AIDS and other
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that HIV positive individuals are
particularly high risk for developing
[SPEAKER_00]: pneumonia, including opportunistic
infections such as pneumocystis carinii
[SPEAKER_00]: pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a few older epidemiological
studies that showed a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: association between marijuana smoking,
these are studies including HIV positive
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, and pneumonia, although
conflicting findings have been reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was our objective to reexamine the
question whether marijuana smoking does or
[SPEAKER_00]: does not increase the risk for pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used data from the Moody Center
AIDS cohort study, which is an ongoing
[SPEAKER_00]: prospective observational study of gay men
regarding the natural history of HIV
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the study was initiated in 1983,
as I mentioned, it's still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We analyzed data from subjects who were
either persistently HIV negative or HIV
positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We excluded those who converted because of
possible confounding by seroconversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the subjects returned to the clinic
every six months, and it was at these
[SPEAKER_00]: visits that we then determined whether or
not, by self-report, whether or not the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients had experienced pneumonia in the
interval and divided the pneumonias into
[SPEAKER_00]: community acquired pneumonia and
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most common opportunistic pneumonia in
HIV positive individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in most cases, the pneumonia was
confirmed by chest x-ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: We censored the data whenever pneumonia
was first diagnosed, when AIDS was
[SPEAKER_00]: developed, and when the subjects reached
the end of the study, which was the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at these six-monthly visits,
we also obtained a lot of information
[SPEAKER_00]: about marijuana use during the interval
since the, well, first about pneumonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also during the interval prior,
the six-month interval prior to the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of pneumonia, as well as
baseline information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Information on marijuana, on exposure to
other risk factors, including tobacco,
[SPEAKER_00]: potential risk factors, alcohol,
other recreational drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also looked at dose-response
relationships, obtained information on how
[SPEAKER_00]: often the marijuana was used over the
previous six months, and actually from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the study as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we performed COX-proportional hazards
to estimate the risk for pneumonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: either community acquired pneumonia or PCP
by marijuana use, and adjusted for the
[SPEAKER_00]: covariates shown in this slide,
age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic
[SPEAKER_00]: status, the prophylaxis against new
assistive pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all for methoxasol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have the beginnings of
Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bactrim, or septra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Pneumovax, vaccination
against pneumococcal pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And adjusted also for tobacco smoking,
of course, use of other illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: substances, either by smoking or by
injection, antiretroviral therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those who were HIV positive,
viral low, CD4 count, and hepatitis C
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the multivariate analysis,
in the persistently HIV negative group,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no association between marijuana
use and the development of pneumonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: community acquired pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the positive control was tobacco,
and there we do see a significant effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of tobacco on pneumonia risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the HIV positive group, again,
marijuana smoking was not associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: an increased risk for pneumonia,
whereas tobacco was, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: a low CD4 count was as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with regard to the risk of
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in the HIV
[SPEAKER_00]: positive group, again, marijuana smoking
was not associated with any increased risk
[SPEAKER_00]: of pneumonia, CD4 counts were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paradoxically, tobacco in this analysis
was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot explain this finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some residual confounding
that we couldn't adjust for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we looked at dose-response
relationships, we failed to find any
[SPEAKER_00]: association between marijuana and the risk
of pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not, irrespective of how
frequently the marijuana was used,
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly, weekly, or daily, in either the
HIV negative or HIV positive populations
[SPEAKER_00]: for either community acquired pneumonia or
for PCP pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, regular marijuana smoking
does increase the risk of chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: bronchitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does impair bacterial and fungal
killing by alveolar macrophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phages obtained from marijuana smokers,
but it does not appear to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of pneumonia, even in individuals
immunosuppressed due to HIV infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to acknowledge, actually,
Josh Quint received his PhD recently in
[SPEAKER_00]: epidemiology from UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Deedles is an epidemiologist,
used to be the Dean of the School of
[SPEAKER_00]: Public Health at UCLA, and we are grateful
to the Max Executive Committee for
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing the data for us to analyze,
although it was rather a painful process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took two years to get a hold of the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I finished on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to answer any questions if I
could possibly see you with the... Over
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: On your left, Donald.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, over here on your left.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my left?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, straight ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Ethan Russo here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: A very elegant presentation, as usual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Donald, I wondered whether you examined
any patients doing vaporization in your
[SPEAKER_02]: cohort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if you vaporize the THC...
Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to expose the lungs to a
lot of the particulate material that is
[SPEAKER_00]: within the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guess is if you studied individuals who
vaporized at THC, you might find that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no association with chronic
bronchitis, which probably has to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure to mostly the particulates and
possibly some of the toxic, volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: material within the smoke as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we did not study vapors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nonetheless, very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was interested in the nitric oxide
evidence that you have for correlations
[SPEAKER_03]: with, I guess, macrophage processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you see that there's any correlation
between the cannabinoids signaling off of
[SPEAKER_03]: the macrophages and suppressing nitric
oxide synthase activation?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not necessarily that nitric oxide
is not being able to be expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that you have cannabinoids
interacting with your macrophage
[SPEAKER_03]: production, since there's some correlation
between those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think... So CB2 receptors probably
exist on macrophages, alveolar macrophages
[SPEAKER_00]: that haven't yet been identified on,
but they most likely do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the binding of THC to those
receptors then essentially deactivates the
[SPEAKER_00]: macrophages, impairs their ability to
produce pro-inflammatory cytokines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the cytokines that are needed to
upregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase
[SPEAKER_00]: that then leads to the conversion of
arginine within the cell into nitric
[SPEAKER_00]: oxide, which is then released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any other hands, but thank you
very much.
Thank you.
