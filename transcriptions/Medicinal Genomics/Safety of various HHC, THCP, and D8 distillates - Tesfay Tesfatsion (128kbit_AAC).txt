[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Tesfaye Tesfatsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work for Sunflower Wellness and Colorado
Comptography.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are based in Denver, Colorado,
or Hudson, and our talk will be on safety
[SPEAKER_01]: profile of HHC, THC, and THCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people don't like the talk
about HHC or any of these partial and
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic cannabinoids, but we wanted to
see what the safety is and how we can
[SPEAKER_01]: basically start to incorporate these type
of studies into the market to give people
[SPEAKER_01]: the information so they can make their own
informed opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we'll outline introduction,
methodology, results, discussion,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then conclusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so far through all the literature that
we searched, CBD, THC, CBC, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of information about safety studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information about HHC
because of very abundance within the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of hemp products, even Delta 9
THC from hemp or THCP or HHC, very little
[SPEAKER_01]: is known out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In literature search, we can't really find
too many.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and a lot of these, I guess,
safety or potency are done through using
[SPEAKER_01]: HPLC and as well as GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with those is some of the
contaminants and some of the impurities
[SPEAKER_01]: are not easily visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people assume that they're getting a
99% pure material.
[SPEAKER_01]: In actuality, there might be some
impurities that might be in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is in vitro studies
are not easily done.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't have, one,
the money, and two, it's just not
[SPEAKER_01]: understood well enough to be able to be
presented.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the side, you can see all the
different, I guess, isomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have when you are trying to
convert CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's XO, ISO, many different,
I guess, structural isomers that are not
[SPEAKER_01]: really well known as well as not easily
separated to be able to be used for a
[SPEAKER_01]: vitro study.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just an outline of some of the
biological testing using MTT assay to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to determine the amount of cell
viability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then characterization using HPLC,
mobile phase, column as being a stationary
[SPEAKER_01]: phase, and injecting your sample and then
doing a pre-clinical study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Previously, well, HHC has been around
probably the past like three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has taken over in a lot of states that
don't have THC as easily accessible,
[SPEAKER_01]: AKA a lot of the southern states are not
easily, you can't get THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So HHC is being a supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get people the euphoria that they
desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easier to find whether it's gas
station or any of those places.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is not a lot of people know
what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So previously, we did a study determining
whether HHC has any effect on your heart
[SPEAKER_01]: using a HERG channel or ion channel study
to determine to see what is and if it has
[SPEAKER_01]: any effect on your cell sodium potassium
channel to give you any type of issue with
[SPEAKER_01]: your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found was using a positive
control, we didn't see any inhibition or
[SPEAKER_01]: very minimum inhibition in comparison to
the positive control at a very low
[SPEAKER_01]: micromolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, we also conducted fibroblast
cytotoxicity just to see how that affects
[SPEAKER_01]: the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, we did see a little bit of
cytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like a lot of kinetics,
anabinoid or a lot of other compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is some cytotoxicity to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the hepatocytes, that's where
we see a very low cytotoxicity even at a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher concentration at above 50
micromolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an earlier study that we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to determine to make sure that,
hey, one, the product is safe and two,
[SPEAKER_01]: information's out there so that people can
make their own informed decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this, I guess, presentation,
we used NMR as a way to determine
[SPEAKER_01]: structural using 500 megahertz.
[SPEAKER_01]: HPLC, again, the standard way of
determining pulmonary impurity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did an Agilent 1100 as well as a
Shumatsu as a secondary checkpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CRMs were purchased from Cayman
Chemicals and the solvents ACS or HPLC
[SPEAKER_01]: grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we tried to collaborate with a lot
of the industrial players, Jonesy Lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: Arvada Labs, and e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: We purchased these materials with the
understanding and letting them know that,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, we're going to conduct this type of
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to get as many people as
possible so that way we can put all the
[SPEAKER_01]: information out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cell viability assay was conducted
with HB Biosciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three cell lines were utilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this way, we can mimic the two ways
that cannabis or cannabinoids are,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, consumed by bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is using small airway,
so inhalation, to mimic somebody smoking,
[SPEAKER_01]: vaping, any of that way to get the
cannabinoid in their system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other way is through the liver,
as in using it as an edible so they get
[SPEAKER_01]: both effects to see cytotoxicity both in
the lungs and in the liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cell lines, the human small airway
epithelial cell line as well as the human
[SPEAKER_01]: fibroblast and then the THLE3 transformed
liver epithelial cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: All studies were conducted under non-GLP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this was all ran at a third party
to get a no bias and also to get a clear
[SPEAKER_01]: information that is not, you know,
we don't own it in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: information, we own the information but we
don't have a bias towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All procedures were validated as well as
signed off by the place that was
[SPEAKER_01]: conducting this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cell lines were purchased by ATCC,
from ATCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just an outline of the MTT assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cells were taken, thawed, centrifuged to
get rid of the supernatant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cells were then re-suspended and added
PBS as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as tryptan blue and then cells
were visualized through a microscope to
[SPEAKER_01]: count it in terms of the viability as well
as the how many were apoptotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of synthetic way, so all the
materials were, we synthesized in-house as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as the ones that were purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them were purified in two
different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was thin film distillation and the
other was taken as accrued.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utilizing common synthetic methodology,
CBD was purchased as is from a hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: company and then cyclization was done
using a strong gas and in this case it was
[SPEAKER_01]: P-toluene sulfonic acid monohydrate using
a heptane as a solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get, the reaction goes from,
progresses from delta, or CBD to delta
[SPEAKER_01]: nine to delta eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thermodynamic pushes it to more the more
stable molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took both the distillate and then the
accrued, removed the solvent into accrued
[SPEAKER_01]: and used it as is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly with HHC, same way, in this case
THC was taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydrogenation was done with it using
palladium and carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use platinum on carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's multiple different catalysts you
can use for hydrogenation with hydrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: and ethanol or different solvents to be
able to get your HHC.
[SPEAKER_01]: R versus S, depending on the catalyst that
you use, you get a different variations
[SPEAKER_01]: and different splits.
[SPEAKER_01]: THCP was fully synthetically made starting
with resorcinol and terpene going through
[SPEAKER_01]: a cyclization, free craft acylation and
then going through the process of making
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDP, then cyclization with
tri-isobutylaluminum and DCM getting D9 to
[SPEAKER_01]: D8 variation of a high D9 to low D8.
[SPEAKER_01]: The HHCs on HPLC were stacked on top of
one another just to show the different
[SPEAKER_01]: type of impurities that you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see close to almost eight or
nine different impurities that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is from four different or five
different companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to say one is better than
the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just showing you guys, hey,
these are the impurities that we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are within the same area
that they're coming off in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: retention time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NMR spectrum of the crude versus
distilled HHC, the one thing to look at in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of if you want to see the ratio of
isomers is if you look at around three
[SPEAKER_01]: PPM, you see a doublet and a doublet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take the integration of those two
and compare it and you'll be able to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what the R versus S or S versus R ratio of
the two compounds are.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just to show you the NMR spectrum
of each.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see too many differences between
them, but HHC is a little bit different
[SPEAKER_01]: because then you're taking THC and you're
hydrogenating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of purification steps
that's included in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, same thing with the delta-8 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, delta-8 is not highly found within
the plant, but it is when you are
[SPEAKER_01]: cyclizing THC, CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you compare it and you see,
again, about six or seven peaks that are
[SPEAKER_01]: showing up within the HPLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, a little bit tall is in there,
XO, ISO.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different isomers of THC in there
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, NMR spectrum of it just to confirm
that that is THC using literature
[SPEAKER_01]: information that's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this THCP, we see almost a two-fold
increase in terms of the impurities that
[SPEAKER_01]: are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is because of the process of
synthetically, it is a synthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can't really find this easily in
the plant and trying to extract it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a synthetic process and some people
will not purify each state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just take one and go to the other
without doing any purification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then towards the end, if you have any
impurities that are carried from the first
[SPEAKER_01]: step, those will be carried out throughout
the whole entire thing and it becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult later on to try to purify them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just sell the material as is
and say, hey, it's 98% or 96% or 95%
[SPEAKER_01]: purity, but when you look at it in terms
of using other methodologies to determine
[SPEAKER_01]: the true potency, you might see it a lot
less.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not really shown in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the HPLC potency of each of the
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We separated them with D9, D8,
CBDP, THCP, CBN, HHC, and the different
[SPEAKER_01]: isomers of HHC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, a lot of these, if you look at
them, none of them reach above 93% purity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a staggering information of,
hey, some of these materials that say that
[SPEAKER_01]: they are 95% cannabinoid, they're not
really 95% cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other cannabinoids within there or
other impurities in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the breakdown of each of the
samples that we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them, we gave them a WC as their
acronym, one, two, three, four,
[SPEAKER_01]: five, just to give them so nobody knows
what they are and information about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right is the HPLC area count or the
milia absorbance per each.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see that even in the WC1,
we're seeing a livitol still in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: some exo, some iso, and the different
isomers of cyclization that comes from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only ones that you don't see that is,
if you look at WC9, the HHC, the RNs,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the other materials are not
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is because of the multiple process of
purification that's involved to go from
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD to HHC, having the THC in there and
being able to go ahead and do the
[SPEAKER_01]: purification.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem there is, well, what's the
hydrogenation version of the exo and iso?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know because not a lot of
literature is out there about what happens
[SPEAKER_01]: when you hydrogenate other isomers of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one thing that we want to
convey is it's not a matter of if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: there or they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely they're there, but we just
don't have any studies that are being done
[SPEAKER_01]: to show what are their toxicity within the
body themself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using two positive control, clopromazine
and tefenidine, we ran these assay with HD
[SPEAKER_01]: bioscience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three compounds, delta-8-THC,
HHC, the RS isomers, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: delta-9-THCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the first column,
hopefully everybody can see that,
[SPEAKER_01]: using the lung fibroblast, we can see the
IC50 of the control was at 14.2
[SPEAKER_01]: micromolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at every other cannabinoid,
the delta-8, in every single sample,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's below the IC50.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabinoids are cytotoxic to the
lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is just mimicking controlled
versus that, our compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at the epithelial cell line
for the small airways, we see a
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent, also low cytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The IC50 of the control at 9.3 micromolar,
and everything else is way below that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are in two micromolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very toxic to the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that we see is when you
compare it to the liver, in the liver
[SPEAKER_01]: cell, tefenidine is at 5.1 micromolar IC50
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is anywhere between three
to 18 times greater in terms of the IC50.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the cannabinoids are cytotoxic to
the liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going through a first pass to the
liver, these do not cause cytotoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might at higher doses, yes,
but within the doses that we were looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at, in terms of control, we didn't see any
cytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So although the contaminants were found
within each sample, the preclinical
[SPEAKER_01]: testing resulted in showing that all the
cannabinoids had an effect, or cytotoxic
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, to the lung, the fibroblasts,
as well as the epithelial cell lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single cannabinoid, delta-8,
and THCP, HHC were all cytotoxic,
[SPEAKER_01]: except for the transfer of human liver
epithelial cell lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were toxic, but not at the
concentrations that we were looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was above the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing was the WC16 had a high
IC50 values.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for that was, when we were
looking at it, the concentration of
[SPEAKER_01]: material that was in there was about 25%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was RS, and total was 25%
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the material, we don't know
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having less cannabinoid was able to
show that the IC50 was a lot higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: it should have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research underscores the critical need
for rigorous scientific inquiries,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we want to make sure that all the
information is out there, giving people
[SPEAKER_01]: the understanding of what is within the
sample that you're purchasing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you are consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding delta-8 THC, delta-4-8 ISO,
XO, the different isomers of THC could
[SPEAKER_01]: represent a potential risk for users due
to the lack of pharmacological
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding, and characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lack of understanding could lead to
unforeseen levels of intoxication,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the effect that these compounds
can have on somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in conclusion, delta-8-HHC and
delta-9-THCP all exhibited cytotoxicity to
[SPEAKER_01]: the lung, both in the fibroblasts,
as well as the small airways.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them had a cytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were actually being used to the liver
cells, based on the concentration that we
[SPEAKER_01]: had them running in the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take any questions if anybody has any.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys try to identify any unknown
peaks using the HPLC or NMR?
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't, because we would need to do
more purification.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't find a lot of the,
I guess, CRMs, but within the budget that
[SPEAKER_01]: we had as well as the time that we had,
we just wanted to take the samples as they
[SPEAKER_01]: are directly without any modification or
adding in any of the other additives that
[SPEAKER_01]: they add so that we could see what the
pure material is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's anything added,
we could potentially later on take samples
[SPEAKER_01]: from e-commerce with the vapes or the
carts and then try to see if that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: any difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did not, unfortunately,
were able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please welcome T.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin, presenting the chemical origins of
fruity and savory exotic cannabis aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Acute negative reactions from consumers,
were any noted?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there has been, but I think it was
about two years ago, there was a FDA had a
[SPEAKER_01]: report of about 20 people who had adverse
effect from Delta 8 or HHC samples that
[SPEAKER_01]: were purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't really fully understood why,
but when they did do a HPLC and also NMR
[SPEAKER_01]: and different potency tests, they did see
a Livotal still being present within the
[SPEAKER_01]: samples and other impurities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those people had adverse effect in
order to, even as severe as enough to go
[SPEAKER_01]: into actually a hospital and get treatment
with hallucinogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were throwing up, there was fatigue,
and there was a lot of issues that came
[SPEAKER_01]: from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was dose dependent or
what could have been caused by it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we did see that when we were doing our
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of cytotoxicity, it might be my
opinion, but it shouldn't matter because
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 9, Delta 8, the only difference is
just an isomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did have some samples that had
Delta 9 in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't want to do all the studies
that have already been done with people
[SPEAKER_01]: from cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we don't have that type of license,
we couldn't really do Delta 9 directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's that legality where if we tell
HDBioscience, hey, can you test this?
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not be able to do it because of
the fact that it requires a license for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to carry Delta 9 compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can go both way because there's nothing
mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just pure compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the potencies,
a lot of them are 85 to even higher
[SPEAKER_01]: potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not 100% or 99% pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is some little impurities in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we wanted to do was, hey,
let's take some of these oils that are
[SPEAKER_01]: being sold as being just pure materials
and run them and see what the effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: the compound themselves are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoids have been known to cause
cytotoxicity to some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the other ones are more
not cytotoxic, but they don't attack
[SPEAKER_01]: normal cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was just done so that we can show,
hey, the oils are being sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what they're putting in
there in terms of when they're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: them as a pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pure materials, they do have some
cytotoxicity associated with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, yeah, we couldn't really do
Delta 9 because if you research,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see plenty of paper that have been
done with Delta 9 as being in their
[SPEAKER_01]: cytotoxicity into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
