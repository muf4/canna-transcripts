[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks so much to the organizers of
CanMed and Cortogen and Doug Kennedy for
[SPEAKER_00]: getting everything so beautifully
organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have made two promises.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I will speak very quickly and stay
within a whole lot of time because we are
[SPEAKER_00]: running over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, I will make sure that you have an
excellent experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to tell this audience
after several days of this fantastic
[SPEAKER_00]: conference that marijuana has been around
seemingly forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at newly discovered
photographic evidence, you will see very
[SPEAKER_00]: closely that it actually wasn't a fig leaf
covering Adam and Eve's most private
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are Harvard Medical School.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look very closely at the inside of
the pyramids and, of course, evidence from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sistine Chapel, you will see that
images related to cannabis have been
[SPEAKER_00]: around for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only kidding, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just a way to transition into
the idea that, in fact, cannabis has been
[SPEAKER_00]: around for thousands of years,
first documented as medicine in 2700 BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was part of mainstream medicine in the
US, part of the US Pharmacology and
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacopeia in 1850, which meant that
doctors could and did prescribe cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for a range of indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 1942, it was out of the Pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by 1970, it was classified as a
Schedule I substance under the then new
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlled Substance Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1996 saw the first medical marijuana laws
in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that time, watch my beautifully
animated slide, we have seen lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: changes across the nation bringing us
current to 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have 28 states plus DC with fully
legalized medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 17 with partial medical marijuana
laws allowing the use of things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: non intoxicating like cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight states plus DC have allowed
recreational cannabis, leaving only five
[SPEAKER_00]: states without access.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the majority of states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very important to keep in mind,
not all marijuana is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this one term, it really should be
termed cannabis, but we call it marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means anything that comes from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't go through the difference in
species since most of us already agree at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything we see is predominantly a
hybrid of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, there are over 400 known
constituents in this magical plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred or more phyto cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that interact with our
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thankfully for all my predecessors at
this conference, I don't have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are things that interact with
our brain and body system of chemicals and
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two main players, no secret here,
delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol,
[SPEAKER_00]: the main psychoactive constituents in the
plant, and cannabidiol, the non
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxicating constituents shown to have
tremendous therapeutic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I'll say before we get into
some exciting data is that medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana should not be
considered the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should not be considered the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the products may be identical,
the plants from which they're derived are
[SPEAKER_00]: identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the modes of use may be
identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of use is very different for our
recreational users than for our medical
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of recreational users,
I've been doing recreational research,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, research on recreational cannabis
users for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their goal is to feel altered,
high, euphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our medical patients say, I don't want to
be high, most of them anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constituent profile is also very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically recreational strains are prized
for their THC potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking for high THC here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, levels of cannabidiol have all
but disappeared from recreational strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: a drop in about 46% since 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our medical patients may have products
that are high in THC and or other CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are other constituents that
factor into the equation prominently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Age of onset, another very critical piece
of the puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically our recreational users begin
using during adolescence or early
[SPEAKER_00]: adulthood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our medical marijuana patients,
not exclusively, but by and large,
[SPEAKER_00]: begin after age 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: That excludes, of course, our pediatric
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go through what the National
Academy of Science, Engineering,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Medicine reported since it's a 395
page paper back in January, but many took
[SPEAKER_00]: heart in the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is conclusive or substantial
evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for what we call the big three,
treatment of chronic pain, treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: nausea and vomiting as a function of
chemotherapy, and treatment of muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: spasticity related to MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recently, since the report was
issued, the senior author of the paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: Marie McCormick, has noted that,
in fact, it seems to be useful in reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: some forms of very severe child seizure
disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: To many of you in the audience,
I know that is not a surprise,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to many out there, it is, and it's
good that we have it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there's moderate or limited
evidence for a range of other conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting that additional research is
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say demanding that additional
research is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there have been a number of medical
marijuana studies to date, research really
[SPEAKER_00]: does remain in its infancy for all the
reasons you've heard here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them have to do with our current
status and some of the guidelines and
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most studies have looked at outcomes
secondary to medical marijuana use for a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific symptom, illness, or indication,
limited sample sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, when we began this work,
we could not find any studies that looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at, specifically, the effects of the use
of cannabis for medical purposes on
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there a difference in individuals who
are using medical marijuana in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: their ability to solve problems and do
tasks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Further, no studies thus far had employed
a pre- versus post-treatment approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter the MIND program, Marijuana
Investigations for Neuroscientific
[SPEAKER_00]: Discoveries, a program I started at McLean
Hospital two and a half years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was designed to basically understand
the effects of medical marijuana use on a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of things, including cognitive
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clinical state, quality of life,
where applicable, brain structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: brain function, and a range of other
measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't have this data available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The program supports a number of projects
designed to examine cannabinoid-based
[SPEAKER_00]: therapies for a range of indications and
conditions, and we use longitudinal,
[SPEAKER_00]: observational, cross-sectional,
survey, and clinical trial models,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a neat trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you some data from an
ongoing longitudinal observational study
[SPEAKER_00]: that's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study was specifically designed
really truly to look at the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana treatment on cognitive
performance, as well as mood, sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of life, brain structure,
and function in patients before they begin
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study is designed to follow patients
over a minimum of one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now gotten permission to follow them
out for 18 months and 24 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients can use for any number of
indications, and their choice of products,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we chart, what they're using,
where they got it, what they're told is in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the information from the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We record it throughout the course of the
study, how often, et cetera, mode of use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have their most commonly used
samples analyzed by an outside laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our laboratory representative is right
here speaking in this very session.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potential participants are referred
from local medical marijuana certification
[SPEAKER_00]: centers or physicians, some of whom are
also here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're eternally grateful for all of you
sending us patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inclusion-exclusion criteria are
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients must have a valid certification
for medical marijuana use or plans to use
[SPEAKER_00]: products that don't require certification,
for example, industrial hemp-derived
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certification can be for any indication,
but they must be marijuana naive at the
[SPEAKER_00]: outset of the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they have any history of
recreational marijuana use, it must be
[SPEAKER_00]: several years in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until very recently, the average number of
years since heavy recreational use was in
[SPEAKER_00]: excess of seven or eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're down to about three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to be THC negative at
baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote our first paper from the study at
the end of last year called Splendor in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been viewed just under 35,000 times
to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess this issue was nominated for
the Frontier Spotlight Award.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only mention this because it underscores
what the nation is interested in learning,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about the effect of the use of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some updated data to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have 38 patients who have completed
their baseline visit and 19 thus far who
[SPEAKER_00]: have completed their visit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're naive at baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see them after three months of
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average age is about 50, predominantly
right-handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indications range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain, anxiety, PTSD, sleep, mood,
attention, and other.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ulcerative colitis, chronic migraines,
petty mal seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they using?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using less than every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've heard some of that earlier in
this conference as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to use every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use just a little less than twice a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use about nine times a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're using about 1.6 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they use?
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoke conventional flower product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vaporize conventional flower product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vaporize oils and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's other use of
oils and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tinctures, medical edibles, and topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lovely array of modes of use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of our product analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get constituent analysis for 10 of
the cannabinoids, which helps us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about the data?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have a pointer, but I will guide
your eye to the important part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look, the very first thing that
jumps out, I see the pointer, is a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant reduction in depressive
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is self-report.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not examiner-driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't the study doctor deciding that
they look better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is self-report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Significant reduction in depressive
symptoms between baseline and after three
[SPEAKER_00]: months of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see significant improvements in
self-reported sleep, as noted by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index,
way up at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: A significant improvement in sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see improvements on a generalized
health survey called the SF-36.
[SPEAKER_00]: Significant improvements in physical role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Significant improvements in energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Significant improvements in social
functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And significant improvements in
self-reported levels of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say really quickly, we have a
completely separate subset of pain-related
[SPEAKER_00]: scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much for me to show in this particular
presentation, but the patients all report
[SPEAKER_00]: significant improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self-reported improvement in pain-related
measures after three months of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very importantly, we also see a notable
decrease in their use of conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 42% reduction in opiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again self-report.
[SPEAKER_00]: 46% reduction in benzos, 33% reduction in
mood stabilizers, and a 22% reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is quite striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, very small sample sizes,
but certainly enough of a signal for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: be very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't belabor the point too much,
other than to say we were very interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in their cognitive performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a lot of time thinking about
frontal executive functions, the types of
[SPEAKER_00]: tasks that are mediated by the frontal
part of your brain, right behind your
[SPEAKER_00]: eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that allow you to inhibit
inappropriate responses, make good sound
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions, and detect conflict where
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have lots of different measures of
these things, including the controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: oral word association task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the FAS task.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a letter of the
alphabet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Name as many words as you can that begin
with that letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digit symbol substitution test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients are basically asked to write as
many symbols as they can using a number
[SPEAKER_00]: symbol key, as many as they can do in 90
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Letter number sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subjects get a string of mixed numbers and
letters, and they're told they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: First the numbers in order, then the
letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stroop color word test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interference condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interference condition basically has
words printed in a different color ink
[SPEAKER_00]: than they spell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain wants you to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most automatic process you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to name the color of the ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harder than it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the trail making test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parts A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part A is simply a test of psychomotor
speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How quickly can you connect the dots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Part B introduces an alternating set
demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to alternate number,
letter, number, letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: One A, two B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, harder than it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, some people were saying, oh,
oh, that looks horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't even make a nice picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the Wisconsin card sorting task,
one of my favorites, considered for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades to be the gold standard measure of
frontal executive function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subjects are given a deck of cards and
four stimulus cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are asked to take one card at a time
and place it in front of one of the four
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulus cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they don't know after being told
correct or incorrect is that the sorting
[SPEAKER_00]: principles change, and they have to
utilize the feedback from the examiner to
[SPEAKER_00]: change their behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the frontal function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, significant improvement from
baseline two, three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day I'll get this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look up here, we see significant
improvements in the FAS task, significant
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements in letter number sequencing,
significant improvements in digit symbol
[SPEAKER_00]: substitution, the stoop color word test,
significantly higher accuracy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and significantly fewer errors of
omission.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a trend for faster response time
during trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stop and say one quick thing,
as if this wasn't quick enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have alternate forms of all of these
tests, so we don't see any practice
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have alternate forms of these
measures at three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a practice effect, plus it's
been three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neuroimaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run something called the Cognitive and
Clinical Neuroimaging Core, where I am
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunate enough to work around lots of
lovely magnets retrofitted in such a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can do structural, functional,
spectroscopic, and diffusion tensor
[SPEAKER_00]: imaging all with what we call one-stop
shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can take lots of different pieces of
information and put them together later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you some data from an
fMRI study that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all of the patients who were able to
complete visit one and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, we have them complete a
task while they're inside the scanner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called the multi-source
interference task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two conditions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the control task, subjects basically
get three numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two are zero, and one is a different
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to report the identity of the
number with a button box.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the control task, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number that's different is in its
correct position as on the button box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have the interference condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, the two numbers that are the
same are not zeros.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a grown-up game of one of
these things is not like the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which one of these things is not like
the other, except now it's not in its
[SPEAKER_00]: correct position as on the button box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to inhibit the overwhelming
tendency of the visual position and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead report the identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just go to the interference task
right here in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Significant improvements in percent
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go from 81.8 to 87.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Significantly fewer errors of omission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Significantly faster response time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't bore you with the derived
interference at the bottom, but suffice it
[SPEAKER_00]: to say, it's quite impressive after three
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, no practice effect expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about their brain imaging?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at baseline, this is at baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no marijuana on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should see some activation,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we see activation right here in
the cingulate cortex during the completion
[SPEAKER_00]: of this task.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a little more activation
typically in the frontal cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens after three months of
treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a very striking difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be a neuroscientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that these images are different,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very different pattern of activation
here in the cingulate and in the frontal
[SPEAKER_00]: cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Significantly more, quote, voxels
activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone wants a physics primer
afterwards, come and see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to summarize what this data shows us,
we see generally demonstrated improvements
[SPEAKER_00]: in a number of these measures of executive
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because a lot of our
work and previous work and work of my
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues has demonstrated alterations in
executive function in recreational users
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrating sort of impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Participants also exhibited notable
increases in activation in the frontal
[SPEAKER_00]: cortex, including the cingulate,
which is a region typically activated by
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our group at baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our group after three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study I did in 2012 of healthy
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our group after three months of
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study of healthy controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three months of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, findings suggest that
participants are able to quantify and
[SPEAKER_00]: report their medical marijuana use
throughout the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see improvements in cognitive
performance that may occur with potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote, normalization of function.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to mood, sleep, quality of
life, we do see some improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very importantly, we see a significant
reduction in self-reported use of
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional medication, specifically a
42% reduction in opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the current crisis, I think that's
worth noting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they improved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Symptom alleviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel better so I can think more clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's certainly a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that unlike recreational strains,
many of our medical marijuana patients are
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing strains that are high in other
constituents, including cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, a number of these folks are on
high CBD-containing products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain cannabinoids may actually exert a
direct or an indirect effect on cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Age of the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: These folks, let's just say it,
these folks are not necessarily within the
[SPEAKER_00]: window of neurodevelopmental
vulnerability.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not 20 or 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average age is 50, as opposed to our
recreational samples significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this to be followed with further
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for my last minute, I will tell
you what else we're up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an FDA-approved clinical trial of
a whole plant-derived botanical,
[SPEAKER_00]: high in CBD sublingual tincture,
approved by the FDA, approved by the IRB,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately on hold with the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the collective grounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's another talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have, very exciting, an
observational study of veterans using
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are basically looking at the impact of
cannabinoids on clinical state and
[SPEAKER_00]: cognition, particularly those afflicted
with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the extraordinary need, we're
looking at folks who are either
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana-naive, that is they haven't
begun yet, or folks who are on a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen of cannabinoids or cannabis
products who are looking to add an
[SPEAKER_00]: additional product and will follow them in
much the same way as these other studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next steps, we'll continue to
examine the impact of medical marijuana on
[SPEAKER_00]: cognition, quality of life, and related
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not stopping now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue to do research that helps
to inform empirically-based guidelines for
[SPEAKER_00]: use, including dosing, product selection,
and age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're exploring cannabinoid-based
therapies specifically for veterans,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for women's health issues,
and a range of other indications,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully using other products that are
currently on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional clinical trial models are
currently being developed to assess the
[SPEAKER_00]: impact of products, which have shown
efficacy anecdotally.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I would say research is
knowledge, and knowledge is power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would implore all of you who are
invested in this particular area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you wouldn't be sitting here if you
weren't, that this is the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: thing we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help those of us who are attempting to do
research push the ball down the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to use a horrible thing from our
previous session, but really move the ball
[SPEAKER_00]: down the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up to us as scientists and
clinicians to inform our patients they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to us to allow them to use safely
and wisely, and to educate them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to help them make good and sound
decisions for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
