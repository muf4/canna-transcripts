[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, we talk with Itzhak Kurek,
CEO and co-founder of Canfermatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Itzhak and his team are measuring the
effectiveness of cannabis-based medicines
[SPEAKER_01]: using biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, they have identified dozens of
cannabis-responsive biomarkers that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: used to objectively quantify the
physiological impact of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment and provide a tool for
investigating the metabolic pathways
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by medical cannabis and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their pilot study looked at patients with
autism spectrum disorder and was published
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Journal of Cannabis and Cannabinoid
Research in December.
[SPEAKER_01]: During our conversation, we discussed
details of the ASD pilot study,
[SPEAKER_01]: the benefits of using biomarkers versus
self-reporting, the bi-directional nature
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis and the endocannabinoid
system, the importance of whole plant full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum medicine products, how the focus
on THC potency stifles medical research,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the challenge of doing proper medical
cannabis research with limited resources
[SPEAKER_01]: and available funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to the interview,
I want to thank this and further ado,
[SPEAKER_01]: please enjoy my conversation with Dr
Itzhak Kurek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Itzhak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for inviting me for this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your team is taking a novel approach to
measuring the effectiveness of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment by using cannabis-responsive
biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we discussed this topic a little bit
when Bonnie Goldstein was on the podcast a
[SPEAKER_01]: little while back, but now we have you
here to dig into the details a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the best place to start is for
you to tell the audience about the autism
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum disorder pilot study that your
team has published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had an autism disorder pilot study
in which it was the first time that we,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a proof of concept, showed that we can
detect cannabis-responsive biomarkers in
[SPEAKER_00]: saliva of children treated with medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Children with autism treated with medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea behind that is that we identified
metabolites that responds to medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis treatment and analyze the change
of those molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that way, we can see if those
molecules change toward any physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: range, which we determine in a group of
typical developing children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way we can quantify first time
the impact of medical cannabis treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me a bit about how did you
determine which biomarkers were of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest and how did you determine what an
optimal range would be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to begin with, we are lacking of
medical scientific data about cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, when we start a biotech
company, we're looking at solutions that
[SPEAKER_00]: exist, at medical scientific paper,
any medical information that we can have
[SPEAKER_00]: on that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis will very much be behind
those knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to discover those biomarkers
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or before discovering, even prove that
they exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do, we use technology called
mass spectrometry, which analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite in saliva.
[SPEAKER_00]: We separate the metabolite again through a
liquid chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we scan for about 1,500 molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at those molecules before
medical cannabis treatment and after
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And identified, in that case, in 15 kids,
we identified about 400 molecules that
[SPEAKER_00]: change before and after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we analyze those molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we analyze those molecules,
we first of all determine that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in molecules that exist at
least at nine children out of the 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least nine children has those
molecules and they change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we want to compare them to,
as you mentioned, to the physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physiological range we determine by
typically developing children with the
[SPEAKER_00]: same boys to girls ratio and the same age
as the study group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at, we average the value of
those molecules at the typically
[SPEAKER_00]: developing group and determine the
standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a rule of thumb, one standard
deviation is the physiological range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call it a Z score.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Z score mean how many standard
deviations the children with autism away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the physiological range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a child is above two or below two
standard deviation, that means that his
[SPEAKER_00]: value is not in the physiological range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's over four standard deviation,
it's significantly away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use our in-house algorithm to
analyze all the samples from all the
[SPEAKER_00]: children and see which one of them were
far before the medical cannabis treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got closer to the physiological
range after the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We choose after what we call peak at the
time of each parent reported that the
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal time that they see a reduced
symptom in these children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way we identified about 65 new
cannabis or the first ever cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive biomarkers that shows a move
towards the physiological range in
[SPEAKER_00]: children with the autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like, so you started with
identifying the 1500 biomarkers and then
[SPEAKER_01]: narrow that down to the 400 that are
actually affected by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after, you know, comparing the
data from the children with autism and the
[SPEAKER_01]: other children, you narrowed that down
even further to the 65 that have some
[SPEAKER_01]: implication for autism spectrum disorder
and are responsive to cannabis treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so this is still temporary cause we
need to increase the data in one way to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a manageable number of biomarkers,
but more important right now, we still
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know within those biomarkers,
which biomarkers are more important and
[SPEAKER_00]: which one of them also, which are the
biomarkers that associated with symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: or with phenotype of autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still need to rank them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes with more with once we
increase the study, we need to rank those
[SPEAKER_00]: biomarkers and determine which are the
most important biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one more thing when we did the
analysis, one rule that we had was that
[SPEAKER_00]: each biomarker that we look had has to
exist in all the children, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: typically developing children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cannot cause sometimes you don't
detect a biomarker because of the level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the levels are too low, you cannot
detect the biomarkers, but we cannot do it
[SPEAKER_00]: with the control group cause we need to
make sure that that biomarkers is
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you said, you kind of hinted into
the next phase of this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, where are you going to, where are
you going to take this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a startup, we are in the
fundraising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always money and funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is that now we are taking
those biomarkers and the study and
[SPEAKER_00]: increase it to about 200 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go beyond the six to nine
year old children.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have adults, more variation
with the medical treatment, but it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: under control of medical cannabis
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 200 participants will allow us to
narrow down to about 20 biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those 20 biomarkers would be in a way our
first service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we rank them and have those
biomarkers, also it's important for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine what is the physiological range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be another, there will be
more typically developing participant to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that the physiological range
could change between ages, gender,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes even different ethnic groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all comes within, I mean,
the big picture, it's how we moving toward
[SPEAKER_00]: precision medicine or personalized
medicine and biomarkers are a part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: huge precision medicine model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we are expanding it to that 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, once we have those values,
we can start actually provide
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation for a patient that being
treated with the medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: either through a doctor or parents that do
it without the doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can provide how the impact or how well
the medical cannabis treatment works.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step after, if we think about it,
probably within, once we have about a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand participants or between thousand
to 2000 participants, we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: start predicting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the beauty of the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's once we can look at the pre-dosing,
we look at saliva before medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment and decide or recommend a
certain product or treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of Canformatics is to provide a
range of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a patient or families could use either
edible or tincture, we will provide both
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation to a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so the goal is that you sort of do
the saliva test, you get a profile or
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like a fingerprint of your own
biomarkers and then based on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: connect with a product that's gonna work
for you, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like, I mean, the idea is when
we go to a doctor and we do a blood work
[SPEAKER_00]: and we see, I would say glucose,
blood glucose or we see cholesterol and
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctor has a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on that, we know if we need the
treatment or we don't need a treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we need the treatment, typically
the doctor knows what type of treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: for a certain range a patient need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's a good point too that I
wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've identified the 65 biomarkers
that have implications here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned that we don't really
know which ones are the most important,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm curious, are you seeing that the
cannabis is sort of at least bringing all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those into some sort of homeostasis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that's the question that I
wanted to ask was, we've talked to other
[SPEAKER_01]: medical professionals on the podcast and
they always talk about how cannabis has
[SPEAKER_01]: this biphasic effect where it can
up-regulate or down-regulate based on
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever your deficiency is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wondering if you see that in your results
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so I think the most interesting
biomarkers, the first one or the most
[SPEAKER_00]: significant that we found and that
basically with the algorithm was NAA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is N-Acetyl Aspartate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that biomarkers, I think in probably
12 or 13 kids out of the 15 changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the change was four or five kids,
it significantly decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we saw changes in about
four or three kids that it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare because we typically use
kind of beta blockers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use pharmaceutical treatment,
which are reducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, we know how to block and
reduce things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to increase things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with cannabis, we see naturally
increases of molecules or decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we analyze this molecule,
actually in the literature, there is
[SPEAKER_00]: disagreement because some studies showed
that in some molecules, not in the context
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis, but just as a biomarker for
autism, some claim that it's extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: high and some claims were that it's low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw both in saliva.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those studies were in saliva.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw both in saliva, but we saw that the
increase to the physiological or decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: to the physiological range happened from
both directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting you bring up the
difference between sort of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other things that we commonly
see with traditional pharma is sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: this idea of one compound, one target.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we're seeing here where we have
multiple targets, or at least we think we
[SPEAKER_01]: do with these different biomarkers,
and we have cannabis that's affecting
[SPEAKER_01]: these multiple biomarkers, it has multiple
compounds within it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you start to unravel that whole
Gordian knot of all different things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like the quote from DiMarzo at 1998
about the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, he described it as relax,
eat, sleep, forget and protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see the wide range of activities
or functions of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin with, treatment has a multiple
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cannot take... And not only autism,
most of the medical conditions that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with or solving with medical
cannabis are typically complex medical
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not... So it's hard to see that
it's a one target, one compound will fix
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a single shot treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think cannabis has this potential
because of this large collection of active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still need to know which active
ingredient do what and also what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage that we need to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the beginning, that's the
starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our study, I would say it with being
very careful with the limited data that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have, we could see that there are at least
specific biomarkers or cannabis responsive
[SPEAKER_00]: biomarkers that response to THC,
a specific one that responds to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the majority that we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomarkers that response a specific to CBD
and few that response to CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So due to the...
[SPEAKER_00]: Small sample size and not huge variation
in the treatment, we could only at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point see those changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the data goes increase,
we can get more and more information about
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabinoid that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely it looks like full spectrum
or multi-component will have better effect
[SPEAKER_00]: than a single dose or a single active
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see any indications that terpenes
are playing a role?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we could not get into that resolution
because I think most of the children use
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very hard to... The reason we
can typically we can see the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: is if we have changes in product or in
children, we detect changes in children
[SPEAKER_00]: that not using THC, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can compare the samples and
identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could not get to that resolution yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But terpene, I mean, they should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they should help because first of all,
we know aromatherapy helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know terpenes have chemical
characteristics that help solubilize
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane and allowing THC or CBD to enter
in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also working as anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a treatment by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just an add on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Curious, were there any patients that were
using... Because you mentioned full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there any that were using sort of
isolated compounds or isolates or was it
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much across the board full spectrum
medicines?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them use isolate, but it's a
combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get at least three, four different
active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, often you see a full spectrum and
then add on another THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were at least, I think three or
four active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: One case, there was only one active
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we're talking about autism,
which is it's a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cannot also, it's a complex medical
condition and it is wide range of a
[SPEAKER_00]: different type of autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm curious about, I mean, so we've
talked about how full spectrum products
[SPEAKER_01]: are the way to go, especially with these
kind of multifaceted disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about on the cultivation side?
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of diversity should we be
encouraging cultivators be growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to address some of these kind of
multifaceted conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started my journey with cannabis I came
from the agriculture biotech world and I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that the way to go is to improve
the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came with ideas that we bring from
that world how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to me that there is a race
for THC and less for full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we start in a plant, once we
start to breathe towards THC, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we're losing all the other active
ingredient because the plant becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: machine only for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the energy, all the metabolic
pathways, everything goes to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that, especially now,
we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know which active ingredients are
working better for any medical condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just know that there are hundreds of
active molecules of cannabinoids in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The capacity of the plant to synthesize
those cannabinoids is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, we're still talking about a
plant that was already domesticated
[SPEAKER_00]: probably for 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we would go to the origin,
if we can find the origin of those plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: they probably have even higher capacity or
more diverse compounds to produce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start domesticating them to one
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even we can think about medical
conditions that we're trying to use now
[SPEAKER_00]: for like cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say maybe it's a good opportunity
to go back and find other new,
[SPEAKER_00]: old molecules or molecules that exist in
the origin of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that we're losing a huge
advantage because it's becoming more
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutics, more like pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pharma knows how to do a single
molecule in very high purity, very
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducible, and probably cheaper than
any other industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had a guest on the podcast
before who their company can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: train yeast in order to create
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that in mind, if THC really were
the end all be all and that were the holy
[SPEAKER_01]: grail, then you could just feed the
precursor to the yeast and have it pump
[SPEAKER_01]: out THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more therapeutic potential
in the plant with all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to imagine at least one of the
challenges in sorting that out is the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that there are a number of compounds that
we're not even testing for right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it could be that there is a lesser
cannabinoid in low concentrations,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we also see that as well,
that low doses can be very effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be doing a lot of the heavy
lifting here that we're just not seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the advantages that we
encourage the producer-processors to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with us, because first of all,
we can see with biomarkers, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things we can see the full picture,
while when we do observation or
[SPEAKER_00]: self-evaluation, it's really a portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a person cannot report how we feel is
inflammation or dysfunctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're using cannabis-responsive
biomarkers with a full spectrum or
[SPEAKER_00]: different combination or different
extract, we can start to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds help which of those biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows us really to dissect the
response and create or even custom-made a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that helps pain, helps anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helps ALS.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those products can help different or
more specifically for a medical condition
[SPEAKER_00]: that now don't exist or don't work or not
optimized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to imagine too, that in a lot
of cases for patients, it's difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: find consistency in their products as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They find a product that works for them,
they use it for a while, then either that
[SPEAKER_01]: product goes away or they have different
source material for a new batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it doesn't work as effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I think that if we have more studies
like this to really identify what those
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds are and how they're actually
moving the different biomarkers,
[SPEAKER_01]: then that's a real strong indication to
those cultivators and those producers that
[SPEAKER_01]: these are the types of products that we
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that again, it brings us to where we
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires R&D and it requires cash or
finance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the end of the day, we'll not
always know how to produce those molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't understand how the plant
does them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the reasons that I can see
inconsistency is because we cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate the condition to grow the plant
and to always get those exact molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them, what we call minor
cannabinoid, there is a reason why they're
[SPEAKER_00]: minor because the plant doesn't make
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it makes it right now for those
conditions is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to learn also, it needs to
come also from the plant side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understanding how to grow plants or
how to stress the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are stress molecules that produce
when the plant is stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to stress the plant in order to get
those cannabinoid out and to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency in those minor cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I hadn't thought of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there might be certain stresses or
certain things that we can do to the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of coax its production of these
minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have to remember the
cannabinoids, the plant doesn't make it
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it to deal with the UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: It deals with insects, sometimes
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the plant and depends on the
molecule, but there are needs during
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're exposed to stress,
whatever they have in their arsenal,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what they can fight with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why the genome is big and they
create many more secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_00]: like cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a basic science that we don't
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And companies typically don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from the academia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now there is no funding for this
type of studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the unfortunate place we are,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With the legal framework, the way it is,
it's really kind of hamstringing us on
[SPEAKER_01]: what we can find out about this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, thankfully there's folks
like you and others who are attending
[SPEAKER_01]: CanMed, who are doing the work and sharing
their findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we can all advance this
together and make the best of the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the way Canformatics does
it, we publish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we published the first paper about the
cannabis responsive biomarkers should be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope a second paper coming, which we use
a little bit of a we use a different
[SPEAKER_00]: separation method and identify another
group of cannabis responsive biomarkers,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly from lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to do it with any medical
condition that we are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to publish as much as possible
because I think it's between companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And producer processors right now and in
the whole industry generate the knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to share it because everybody
going to benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people want to learn more about the
work that you all are doing or if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a way to either sign up for updates or
follow you on social media, anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, please plug away now and I'll put
links to all those resources in the show
[SPEAKER_01]: description as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can easily find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our case, in our case, it's
obviously Canformatics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a link for paper and also a short
video about the technology and a
[SPEAKER_00]: subscription that we are keep announcing
findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all Canformatics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are great resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
