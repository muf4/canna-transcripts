[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it isn't so much what happens
during the growing of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's in the post-harvest activities,
the drying, the curing, and the trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if you could speak a bit about
what you found around that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's another aspect that's
super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's leave the grower aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've picked up a whole batch
of harvested flour and now you're deciding
[SPEAKER_01]: how am I going to trim this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want to do the standard wet trim
where you push all the flowers through
[SPEAKER_01]: into a trimmer and then dry the individual
buds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you want to hang dry where
everything is left intact and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture is taken out and then you can
trim off your leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: We found a pretty big difference between
hang dry and wet trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wet trim creates some damage obviously
to the leaves and releases chemicals or
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that a lot of moles that might
be present, particularly penicillium,
[SPEAKER_01]: start to feed on it and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even during the drying process,
you're seeing buildup of these moles in a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower that's been trimmed wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, when you dry this thing
first, you're not allowing these wound
[SPEAKER_01]: sites or broken off leaves as a source for
mold and yeast to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire flower structure is dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've eliminated 90% of your yeast and
mold and then when you start trimming it
[SPEAKER_01]: as a dry trim, we found the yeast and mold
levels were way lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing that definitely will
make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers are using the hang dry
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll probably find they don't have as
much issues with yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't look at anything beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, you know, the curing
process or the packaging and storing
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all growers know that when you
store inappropriate humidity or
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, you're going to get buildup
of yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they know that if you cure them too
long or under high moisture, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't really look at that aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of stopped right at the point
where the flowers had been trimmed,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's wet or dry and then collected
data from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any idea like in terms of
percentage what growers are typically
[SPEAKER_00]: doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more common for them to be doing wet
trimming versus dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're shifting a lot towards dry trim
because it's less work in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they can bring the flowers into
the dry rooms, hang them and then deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with them later.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drying process itself is very
detrimental to yeast and mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is obviously a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you have dry herbs and dry
products, dried figs, they tend to last a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot longer because the moisture is taken
out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly with dried flour, the problem is
that you never get down to zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen a dried flour get down to
zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a fraction that still hangs
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that population can always build up
later on if the storage conditions aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're coming in with a very high
yeast and mold load, then nothing you do
[SPEAKER_01]: after harvest is going to bring all of it
down to zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two components.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to reduce the yeast and mold while
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after you harvest and bring it
in, try to do things that will reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast and mold even further in that
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're handling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
I'll see you next time.
