[SPEAKER_02]: This episode, we discuss outdoor hemp
cultivation with Dr. Allison Justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to apologize for the audio
quality on this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems we had an unreliable internet
connection and as a result, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: audio got a little garbled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it'll be too distracting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the information that Allison provides
is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stick with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Allison is the co-owner and
manages operations at the Hemp Mine,
[SPEAKER_02]: a 40 acre farm in South Carolina that
manufactures consumer ready products.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hemp Mine currently produces a wide
array of different products ranging from
[SPEAKER_02]: smokable flour to tinctures of all
different concentrations for both humans
[SPEAKER_02]: and animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hemp Mine also breeds regional trials
indoors and outdoors at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to offer validated hemp genetics
to the hemp market in the form of stage
[SPEAKER_02]: three tissue culture, unrooted cuttings
and rooted cuttings, also known as liners,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Topics we discuss include how the hemp
boon that occurred after the 2018 farm
[SPEAKER_02]: bill helped and harmed farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Research that universities are doing with
regards to photo period, drying and curing
[SPEAKER_02]: and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: How understanding a plant specific photo
period can be used to maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: How using supplemental light outdoors can
prevent flowering in semi-auto flower
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: The importance of selecting hemp varieties
that suit a regional climate and how Hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine's field day helps educate new hemp
farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation with
Allison, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, TenBuds.
[SPEAKER_02]: A site dedicated to all things cannabis
with a special focus on growing and
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: TenBuds is packed with fascinating and
informative articles, resources and
[SPEAKER_02]: reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis growers, enthusiasts and business
professionals alike can explore in-depth
[SPEAKER_02]: looks at everything from considerations
for cannabis business owners to the
[SPEAKER_02]: evolution of marijuana's place in society,
its health benefits and so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Visit TenBuds.com to learn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and without any further ado,
I hope you'll enjoy my conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: with Dr. Allison Justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Allison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's talk about hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You own and operate a farm in South
Carolina called the Hemp Mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about your operation and what got
you started growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we are a vertically integrated
hemp company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little bit of everything from
breeding to young plant distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: co-owners in an extraction facility,
and we also have a consumer good product
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: What got me into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it was a, I suppose a jump from
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I graduated with my PhD,
I went out to California and worked in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana industry for about three and a
half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being from South Carolina where I am
now, South Carolina came out with
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations to allow for growing hemp and
my family being farmers, they got involved
[SPEAKER_00]: and eventually it just made sense to take
some of the knowledge I learned out in
[SPEAKER_00]: California back home and take it away with
CBD and CBG and all the other cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that were allowed to grow under hemp
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now a few years back, a lot of people
got really excited about the hemp industry
[SPEAKER_02]: with the passage of the 2018 farm bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that legalized hemp
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many farmers, and it sounds like your
family is one of them, switched their
[SPEAKER_02]: farms over to hemp or some added hemp as a
supplement to their traditional crops to
[SPEAKER_02]: get in on the boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the state of the hemp industry
now and where do you see it in the next
[SPEAKER_02]: few years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that first year was a really big
boom and a lot of people jumped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think even the year after, even more
people jumped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on one hand, it's great with the
amount of people growing hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: people understanding it, not being scared
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, that initial jump
was not great for the industry in a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put a lot of biomass in the market,
put a lot of people, whether they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive mindset for being in the industry
or not, they were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there were a lot of people selling
seed that ended up being marijuana or
[SPEAKER_00]: forming these co-ops that they promised
all of these farmers that were basically
[SPEAKER_00]: on their last leg as being their last hope
to save the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this huge co-op was going to put all
these farms together and they were all
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be rich together and then did not
shake out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of horror stories came from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people lost money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have stayed in it and done
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of good and bad of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this first initial kind of shake
out has really caused us the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: restructuring how hemp is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how it's grown and kind of the
business model and the landscape that it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's finally getting a little more
legit, a little more as any other
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural industry would and should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been slow and a hard road to get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that portion, the past few
years have been extremely exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what we've learned about this
plant and what it can do has been
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just for example, I work very
closely with Clemson University and up
[SPEAKER_00]: until two years ago, they didn't even want
to hear the word hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm on grad committees with
students who are able to use their hemp as
[SPEAKER_00]: a host plant and just the amount of
research they're putting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in my little section of
horticulture, you know, vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: production, flowering, that sort of thing,
not even touching on fiber and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the animal science, you know,
everything else that can go into just my
[SPEAKER_00]: little world of plant science.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has just explored some of the effect
from just our own customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those are the things that I
suppose keep us going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that that medicinal piece that,
yes, we really are helping people and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the industry kind of
straightening out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned sort of the other uses
for hemp, whether it be fiber or the other
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that you've mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where do we stand right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the lion's share of the market going
towards CBD or cannabinoid production?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you seeing more more farmers
growing for fiber?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think people want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They desperately want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the infrastructure is on its way
and on its way fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's a few spots that,
you know, are either on their late stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of R&D, you know, ready to make,
whether it's manufacturing or are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are a couple in existence,
but I think the demand of wanting to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of crop versus having everything
lined up as far as equipment, just to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and equipment to to process it to
fiber or, you know, whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial use there might be is lacking a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think by next year,
there'll be a good many acres grown for
[SPEAKER_00]: that here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I I'm a believer that, you know,
hemp fiber could be the future in a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's I'm just surprised I
haven't seen it happen yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to hear that it's that it's right
around the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You touched on research as well and that a
lot of the universities are now willing to
[SPEAKER_02]: to do the research into hemp production.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, have there been some
breakthroughs recently that that you could
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of tell us about?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can that research into hemp also
apply to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, I'm going to go back to Clemson
just because that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the group I work the closest with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's all sorts of great work
going on medicinally and and with fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: and animal feed and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just with what I'm really closely
privy to, Clemson University and a good
[SPEAKER_00]: many others are doing some some really
neat work into the physiology and direct
[SPEAKER_00]: application of science to help flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I mean by that is taking a
hemp plant, CBD dominant, and putting that
[SPEAKER_00]: in an indoor condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly what you would do with
marijuana, you know, 100 percent minus
[SPEAKER_00]: just being a different cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, they're they're able to
have these wonderful grow chambers and get
[SPEAKER_00]: really nitty gritty with everything from
temperature to light intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clemson right now is really digging deeply
in which is one of my favorite things to
[SPEAKER_00]: study is the drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking at, you know, what is what
is ethylene's role?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, in in other
horticultural fields, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's storage of apples or storage
of cut flowers, you know, we understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that backwards and forwards, we realize,
you know, what what sort of CO2 O2 is
[SPEAKER_00]: going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do we want ethylene there to
ripen up a banana or do we want to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene out because it's making our cut
flowers degrade and die very quickly and
[SPEAKER_00]: not be able to make it on the ship from
Africa to to wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of those really important
things as far as plant science goes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we just have no idea how they apply to to
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and nothing published
right now, but that's just some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that they're looking into and,
you know, being directly relevant to the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's just some some short
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the work that they're doing
is very critical to the point where
[SPEAKER_00]: actually Dr. Faust and I, that's that's
who I work with very closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clemson is actually who I got my my Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: under.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a flowering physiologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has spent his lifetime working with
the flowering of poinsettia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at unrooted cuttings and and those
being shipped across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, how to keep those alive
longer, how to preserve them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, being being extremely
relevant to marijuana or CBD, production
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor, so basically any sort of smokeable
flower production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's he's really grabbed hold
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so other industries, so let's say the
the floriculture industry, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations where, you know,
there's researchers that are really into
[SPEAKER_00]: research, which is immediately applicable
to to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, be able to increase
efficiency or reduce labor costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whatever it may be that's
applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They form these associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for floriculture, it's the floriculture
research alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, growers will pitch in a little
bit of money to help support that research
[SPEAKER_00]: where they can just, you know,
go go deeper and harder with it versus
[SPEAKER_00]: only being able to get grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those growers are able to take
advantage of of, you know, being first to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lineup to receive that information all
through the year versus, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: wait two years for a paper to get
published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, Dr. Faust, Clemson University and
the HempMind, we have formed a nonprofit
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Cannabis Research Coalition,
where we are doing this exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forming an association where growers,
you know, vendors, people can join who
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to push research forward with
the research, you know, knowingly really
[SPEAKER_00]: circulating around smokeable flower
production and post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the factors of hemp that
our skill set is really in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just launched, you know, a month ago
and have had a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly enough, a lot of
interest from the marijuana industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, like I said,
it's all exactly the same and extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait to see what we'll be able
to put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if there's room for a genomics
company to be part of that coalition,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might be able to get you in
touch with one that that would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will definitely follow up on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing you touched on that I want
to come back to is drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sounds really interesting in a
number of ways, but one from at least our
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, medicinal genomics,
we do a lot of microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how important is the drying and curing
process and maintaining your, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: making sure that your finished product is
clean and free of any microbes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know I've talked to other
testing labs who have actually helped
[SPEAKER_02]: their customers, you know, pass yeast and
mold testing largely in part by looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: their drying and curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I think it may be the most
important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, granted, you're not spraying
some sort of beneficial microbe the day of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, granted, you're not doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it could be the number
one factor in being able to pass those
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, reaching out to other
industries and understanding how they
[SPEAKER_00]: function and use science to make healthy
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, understanding your water
activity and how that influences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, basically water activity
being the amount of water that's there
[SPEAKER_00]: available for microbes to grow and
prosper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, understanding how to knock that
water activity down fast enough to not
[SPEAKER_00]: allow for continual microbial growth,
but at the same time teeter tottering that
[SPEAKER_00]: line where you're not drying so fast to
where you're losing all your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's there's definitely a fine
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, yes, if you if you bake
it, you know, drive very quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you're going to have the least
risk of microbials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we can't do that if we're
growing for smokeable flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to we want it to look and smell
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that that requires, you know,
a different scenario, which would we can
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve and we can achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, being able to really
dig into somebody's drying and curing and
[SPEAKER_00]: even, you know, I kind of like to include
it when I do work with growers in their
[SPEAKER_00]: post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just look at the day it enters
the dry room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's more of looking at specifically
the last few weeks in the grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are you applying?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you not applying?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how are you watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you watering with sprinklers from not
sprinklers, but the the types of emitters
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of bubble up from the bottom?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are you still applying
beneficial microbes through that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually aerosolizing to some
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of those factors I like to
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, in the dry room,
how's your air circulating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's your where's your dead spots?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where's your hot spots?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of those little factors are
just are so invaluable when not only just
[SPEAKER_00]: producing a good quality smokeable flower,
but yeah, being able to pass those
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to imagine that being in a
climate like South Carolina that's very
[SPEAKER_02]: humid, that's even even more of a
consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess sort of to that point,
I I did watch an interview that you had
[SPEAKER_02]: done with another podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you were talking about sort of the
regionality of hemp production and how,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you being in South Carolina and
working a lot with cultivators sort of in
[SPEAKER_02]: the southeast and talking about some of
the special considerations that need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: taken for what region that you're growing
hemp in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if you could speak a
bit more to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, every I'd say every month,
the importance of of having a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing outside that is
conducive to that environment for one
[SPEAKER_00]: reason or the other is just is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd say the two biggest factors,
you know, with the most importance is one,
[SPEAKER_00]: the the natural disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in the southeast,
you've got really high humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: really high heat and just, you know,
a bountiful natural microbial existence of
[SPEAKER_00]: of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with with considering you
cannot apply fungicides that that are
[SPEAKER_00]: curative, let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being, you know, synthetic pesticides,
fungicide on the ground, having that
[SPEAKER_00]: natural population of pathogen there,
just ready to fight your plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: having some natural disease resistance in
the variety that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we grow hundreds of different
cultivars in our field every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it looks like we've done some
sort of chemical experimentation because
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see some rows that look like,
you know, the burning bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it looks like it's been
completely burned where it's it's a fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen that there's some varieties that
no matter what you do, I don't care if you
[SPEAKER_00]: put the most expensive, you know,
beneficial fungus, fungal product out
[SPEAKER_00]: there on it every single day, it's not
going to it's not going to touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so breeding and selecting for those
varieties, which can naturally ward off
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those problems is is beyond
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the second most important
factor, especially considering,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, being being a vendor of the
whole United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we focus in the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, understanding photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, again, working under a
professor that, you know, his research
[SPEAKER_00]: revolved around poinsettias, you know,
I got a really nice intro to that in grad
[SPEAKER_00]: school with another house plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But understanding that photo period and
being able to take advantage of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing by understanding that per
variety is just extremely special and
[SPEAKER_00]: important and I think more important than
many like to consider yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to kind of give you an example
of that, we have one variety called
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern Sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the south, it does fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It it it initiates flower the latest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning it has the shorter flower
initiation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, most varieties are
somewhere around, you know, once once the
[SPEAKER_00]: bell curve of of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about, oh, goodness,
you know, the apex of the summer where the
[SPEAKER_00]: days are the absolute longest when it
starts going back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going back into short days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it hits a certain point, that's when
a variety will flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most will flower when you hit about 14
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunset, on the other hand, it initiates at
about 13 hours, 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's only about a 30 minute time
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, it's about a two and a
half to three week difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that means is this plant
initiates two to three weeks later,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then it also finishes two to three
weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, in the south, that is
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to get cooler for that late
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can plant other ones in your field
that, you know, will have that 14 hour
[SPEAKER_00]: photo initiation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you've got two weeks between
your harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you can harvest half of your
crop, put it in the barn, dry it,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean the barn out and then do the other
half of the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So staggering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really helps save that time and
labor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great plant for the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we've done trials in other
areas, we understand, well, if you go
[SPEAKER_00]: above basically West Virginia and you grow
this plant, you're going to be in trouble,
[SPEAKER_00]: very likely, because it is going to also
finish late.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to look, you know, look just as
good as it does in the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is the frost sneaks up on
you because of that late harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not able to get to its greatest
maturity before it's killed by the frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that just being another
example of why it's so important to if
[SPEAKER_00]: your if your goal is to produce plants
which grow outdoors in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and photo periods,
you know, why do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so you're really taking advantage of
the fact that you have a warmer autumn
[SPEAKER_02]: down there in the south by having this
this plant that initiates flower much
[SPEAKER_02]: later in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially as a hobbyist grower up
here in the northeast, definitely gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: burned before having things finish late
and not even so much the frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we always seem to get battered with
just cold, wet, raw type of days that just
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, botrytis just loves that sort of
stuff.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So speaking of disease resistance,
because you did bring that up and you said
[SPEAKER_02]: that you select for disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, are you intentionally inoculating
these plants to see if they develop
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms or are you just sort of putting
them in the field and kind of letting
[SPEAKER_02]: nature do its thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the southeast, you don't need to
inoculate anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we're talking botrytis,
southern blight, you know, some of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those really common ones, you don't need
to inoculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to take down those plants,
which, you know, are either naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: unresistant or if if let's say you don't
water them for four weeks or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if if by your own fault, you make the
plant weak, it shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows up as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, we don't really need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in going back to the photo period
thing, too, because I did I did read about
[SPEAKER_02]: it on your website and I was kind of
fascinated to hear it, because,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, the general rule of thumb with
growing cannabis is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative, it's 18 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you want to flip it to
flour, it's 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was interested to hear that,
you know, that that 12 hour rule is not
[SPEAKER_02]: set in stone, that it can be can be
variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're inside and, you know,
all you got to do is flip a switch or set
[SPEAKER_00]: a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nature has its its own photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's you know, we we never get to that
18 hour time slot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we're our varieties are
nowhere near what we do indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say, you know, we're we're
that's not to say that that 12 and 24,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 and 18, wherever it may be,
you know, that's not optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the work again that
they're doing at Clemson is showing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, again, how you can even indoors,
how you can manipulate some of of those
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics based off of a variety's response.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can you can have your plants
take off a week to begin that flower
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation or you can on certain
varieties, you know, be able to apply 14
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's during flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for that's two more hours that
you could, you know, fill that plant full
[SPEAKER_00]: of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's not just an
importance understanding outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the indoor cycle too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really being able to maximize your ones
is, you know, I think we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some some really funky rules and recipes
to follow in the next couple of years
[SPEAKER_00]: versus just the the 12 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you said that, it reminded me of
something else that I saw on your website
[SPEAKER_02]: was using supplemental light as a way to
sort of trick the plant into not
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, that's that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of opposite of sunset,
you know, that's initiating flower at 13
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have varieties that, you know,
I've termed as semi autos because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really know what else to call them,
especially in this industry and how we use
[SPEAKER_00]: certain terms, because it's not a true
auto flower, because auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's it's basically just a
ticking clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's once it gets to sixty three days,
you know, whether the lights are at one
[SPEAKER_00]: hour or twenty four hours, it's going to
flower based on age, meaning you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: take clones from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only reproduce it through seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these flowers, you know,
they truly are photoperiodic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just they have a really long
initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order for them to stay vegetative,
they have to have 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you think about it anywhere in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at any point of time, you're only ever
going to top out at what 15, 15 and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if you if you are in a
greenhouse growing this plant as stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: you keep it under 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you're able to to grow stock
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take cuttings from it, keep those
cuttings above 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like any other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you take that plant, the the
liner and you plant it outside and it
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it gets to maybe a foot tall and
it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you think, all right,
well, maybe this is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a terrible thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's trash this variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if if we if we work this right,
we can really take advantage of this
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge around this plant and and do
some really cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what some of my growers and ourselves
at the hemp mine have done, I think our
[SPEAKER_00]: top semi auto selling variety is peach
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smells great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what we're able to do is in
South Carolina, you know, basically May
[SPEAKER_00]: 15th, we can plant our first plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say that, I mean it because
that's when the last frost came.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can plant peach haze out
there, turn on a flood light from two
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as that flood lights on,
it'll continue to grow vegetatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, two, three weeks,
however, you know, close or far away you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to space them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut that light off and then you're
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that's that's really
special and important because in South
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina, we can do that three times in a
season, you know, without the expense or
[SPEAKER_00]: annoyance of pulling shade cloth,
building a greenhouse, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a hoop house where you've got guys
out there pulling cloth every single day
[SPEAKER_00]: and able to really maximize that growing
season outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing it's it's really useful
for is greenhouse growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an existing greenhouse grower,
if you're wanting to put in a blackout
[SPEAKER_00]: system, it's just as expensive as
basically building a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead, you pick a different
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pick peach haze, you know,
you grow it just like you would any other
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, except you put maybe string lights,
you know, just very inexpensive LED string
[SPEAKER_00]: lights across the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep it again, you keep it vegetative
for a couple of weeks, turn the lights off
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're flowering and you never have to
pull shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that all year long because
again, you're never getting under 18
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're flowering right in the middle of
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you touched on to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great for for you as as a clone
producer, as a nursery, because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: able to unlike without a flower,
like you said, you can still take
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a nice segue to talk
about maybe seed production versus clonal
[SPEAKER_02]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering, I mean, then maybe we
can start with you kind of explaining from
[SPEAKER_02]: from a business perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you decide that, you know,
clonal propagation or selling clones is is
[SPEAKER_02]: more advantageous than than being a seed
producer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess a lot of things go into this
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, first off, you know,
if we go back to 2016 when when hemp was
[SPEAKER_00]: was, well, I'm sorry, when I would I guess
2016, I was playing with hemp in
[SPEAKER_00]: California under the marijuana rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when I'm when I'm playing
with hemp, you know, you can look at it a
[SPEAKER_00]: few ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, if you're a marijuana grower,
you know, how how are you propagating?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually from clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the reason for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because we want high consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want ease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have to pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's a million reasons that I
can go on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at again, at the beginning of of
when hemp really got going, the the price,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you were growing just for isolate
or, you know, let's say the product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would get the least return on whatever
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price was still that clones were were
were achievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were going to meet your ROI.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I would like to add to
that is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like from from your point of
view, it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how long have we been breeding
hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, being from the horticulture
industry, you know, it for just a petunia,
[SPEAKER_00]: a new petunia to be released, you know,
it could take eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to breed it, to be confident in
it, to send it around to different
[SPEAKER_00]: regions, to do trials and understand the
data and then be able to guide your
[SPEAKER_00]: customer on how to grow it to the to the
greatest extent and then them do well and
[SPEAKER_00]: want to order from you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, going back to that first
year, there's seed producers where in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world they came from, I don't know,
you know, popping up saying that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: home based in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, giving out genetics that
are crushing people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: are not doing what they say or,
you know, have four percent THC in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've had time since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some, you know, legitimate
seed companies out there now that have had
[SPEAKER_00]: time and time to to not only help
homogenize their seed lines, but time to
[SPEAKER_00]: to help themselves understand where those
varieties can grow best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in short, it takes time to grow a
really nice homogenous line of any plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, between those two
reasons, it made a lot of sense to breed,
[SPEAKER_00]: select and and find those clones,
those those vegetative plant materials
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, I could be extremely
confident in, you know, be be able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, lead my customers down a path of
success, whether that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is when you're no matter where you're
at, you give me your zip code and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you when this plant's going to
initiate and when you should get it tested
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you're not, you know,
at what point you're going to go hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: what diseases, you know, will will you
struggle with, you know, every single
[SPEAKER_00]: detail for success?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was able to do that by
understanding the plants I was working
[SPEAKER_00]: with, which would only happen at this
point in time through clonal lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's not to say that I don't
believe that for for oil production,
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed is not the future if it's not
the now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if if you are are struggling to
get two hundred dollars per kilogram of
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate, it probably makes sense to grow
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a little bit of variability
between you know, six and 12 percent or if
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't look exactly the same or if
they have, let's say, a stagger of of two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks finish time, you know, maybe it
doesn't matter because you're just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to chop them all down on the tractor
anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the the market that
we're really approaching and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: customers that that we work with are are
the ones which are growing for smokable
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them now this past year and
especially coming up this current year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're growing for terpene
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the variability in seed
with terpene production is also there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're growing for terpene
production, you want every single plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: to basically have that same terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, again, with the return
on terpenes being much higher than,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, isolate, you know, they can
afford a little bit higher plant cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes a lot of sense because their
quality at the end there is going to line
[SPEAKER_00]: up, be all the same and be able to to get
a good price point for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, glad to hear that, you know,
terpene, the terpene market is
[SPEAKER_02]: flourishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always good to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So winding down here, I did want to give
you an opportunity to talk more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did want to ask you about the field day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Event that your your team puts on,
because I think it's a great educational
[SPEAKER_02]: event where people get to get to actually
experience the plants that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: producing and and really see how things
are performing in the field before they
[SPEAKER_02]: purchase it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if you could talk a bit
about that and why you believe it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's my I guess you say most stressful,
but favorite time of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put on the conference every year and
very much the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look forward to it and you're like,
oh, but no, it's something that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: love doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, from the get go,
I saw value in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're after a year, you know,
really seeing seeing how it's shaped out
[SPEAKER_00]: and the value that is brought to other
people has been very endearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we do is we host.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually a two day field day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was saying earlier, you know,
we always send out our new varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: old varieties to very different regions of
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and collect our data that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Carolina being our home base,
you know, we we do our own variety trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, brand new varieties,
existing varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hunts, you know, we have just
about, you know, as many plants there in a
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 acre plot, then maybe some states have
it's it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testing costs are outrageous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's totally worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is such a treat getting to see them
change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, version three of Cat Daddy,
let's say, come down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, we we plant those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We invite the public farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone out to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, the goal there is to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, allow a farmer who is unsure,
you know, whether they want to plant seed
[SPEAKER_00]: or home, whether they want to work with us
or another company, you know, whether they
[SPEAKER_00]: even want to get into him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to provide guidance, education and
show them, you know, if you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: smokable flour, you know, this is what the
expectation is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, here are varieties which that
which fit that demand if you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for, I don't know, a purple flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, here's our segment of purple
flowers and really allow a farmer to see
[SPEAKER_00]: and touch and fill with his own eyes
before putting in a purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's getting better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the days of just being
thrown one COA and a picture and saying
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how it's going to go, you know,
send me twenty thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's that's just not good
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people being able to come out
and look at it is is highly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, we have,
you know, I get up there and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our new introductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I talk about some of the
contract research we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, within within our variety
plots, we'll do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year, one big one was with Promix.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a micro razy company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, having treatments with
them with different varieties and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, being able to show the farmer
that and show them the difference and what
[SPEAKER_00]: to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Promix being there on site where
if they do have any questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they can talk to their technical
rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a little bit of a,
you know, a mini trade show, I guess you
[SPEAKER_00]: could say with, you know, about eight
different vendors, ones that I use and
[SPEAKER_00]: would trust to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, discuss everything from
soil to zero tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this year we had Dr. Fowles come
out and give a lowdown of what he's got
[SPEAKER_00]: going on there and on campus greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's a fun thing we do every year
and we'll keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, next next fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think I think it's a great a great
resource, because as we said before,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of people getting into the
hemp industry and it's hard to find good
[SPEAKER_02]: guidance and good information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fact that you're you're providing
that for them is is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, it aligns with kind of our
mission here at CanMed as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and to that point, please do let us
know when the next field day is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be happy to spread the word to our
audience and try to get some people down
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that wrapping up, I know I've
taken you over the time, but I've just
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyed talking with you a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So wrapping up, if you have any social
media or website or anything to plug to
[SPEAKER_02]: help people get in touch with you or
additional resources that you think would
[SPEAKER_02]: be beneficial for people to read up on,
please do share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please check us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our website is just the hempmine.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a YouTube page where we get
super nerdy and talk deeply about photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period and and, you know, field
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And care, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to update it pretty regularly with
with things that are directly useful for
[SPEAKER_00]: for farmers and producers.
