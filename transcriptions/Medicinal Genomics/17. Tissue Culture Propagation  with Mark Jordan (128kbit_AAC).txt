group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each year we are consistently blown away
by the amazing presentations, inspiring
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations, and important connections
that are made at the annual CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to keep the conversations
flowing online with our CanMed Community
[SPEAKER_00]: Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CanMed Community is our virtual forum
allowing you to interact directly with
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the CanMed Conference speakers,
past attendees, and other group members to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss all things cannabis from bench to
the bedside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the link in the show description to
visit that group today and join.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode's guest is Mark Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark is currently the Chief Executive
Officer at Minibus, which is headquartered
[SPEAKER_00]: in Longmont, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a tissue culture lab dedicated to
cannabis research and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: His previous positions include work at
Colorado Seed, Eurofins Biodiagnostics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Denver Botanic Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: While at the Denver Botanic Gardens,
Mark worked as a research horticulturist
[SPEAKER_00]: running the Protocol Creation Tissue
Culture Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This experience allowed him to understand
the potential for the application of
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture for the cannabis industry
and set him on the path he is on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you might expect, Mark and I spent a
lot of time talking about the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark was kind enough to walk me through
the basics of the process, including the
[SPEAKER_00]: four stages of plant tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also got into how tissue culture
propagation differs from clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation, how tissue culture can be
used to remediate plants infected with
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens or viruses, germinating seeds
into tissue culture, dark rooting in
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you've never grown a cannabis
plant before, I think you will find this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Mark, I'd like to thank our sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Heart Nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Heart is a cannabis bioscience
company that's creating exciting new
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics for growers and consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company was founded in 2007,
and today it runs a seed to shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: operation that includes a breeding
program, tissue culture lab, production
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, and a new branded consumer
products line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Heart products can be found in farms
and dispensaries throughout California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit darkheartnursery.com to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, this episode is fueled by the
hemp and coffee exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know, hemp coffee is a
healthy, delicious natural product rich in
[SPEAKER_00]: trace minerals and nutrients, providing
sustained energy without the crash of
[SPEAKER_00]: regular coffee.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
I bring you my conversation with Mark
[SPEAKER_00]: Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Ben, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate you taking the time to
talk with me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you'll forgive me if my line of
questioning is a bit rudimentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself am not a cultivation expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thankfully, I trust many folks
listening are not either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully they'll appreciate me keeping
things a little basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do have a ton of respect and
admiration for the folks who are good
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators, mainly because I have grown
cannabis myself and can attest to the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not nearly as simple as it
seems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you take cultivation and propagation
to a whole nother level with tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I was hoping for those who are
not familiar with tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: could you please give us kind of a general
overview of what that process is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I tend to tell people for the
first time that are just kind of learning
[SPEAKER_02]: about it, getting into it, is along the
lines of tissue culture is growing a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: from a small group of cells in a sterile
environment, generally in a test tube or
[SPEAKER_02]: something along those lines, in a media
that is all the hormones, nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: and vitamins the plant needs to grow,
thrive, stay alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the substance you're growing it in,
imagine it's a jello packet with all those
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients, hormones, and vitamins
included.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant sits in a fairly firm sort of
media.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this process better than the
tried and true putting a seed into the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the biggest reason is you get a
consistent plant the same way you would
[SPEAKER_02]: get with cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take a lot of cuttings,
you're going to get that same height on
[SPEAKER_02]: every plant by the time they're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get the same structure
spread, all that sort of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds actually grow about 20% faster than
they standard just cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so seeds are actually a very viable
method to grow a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem is if they're not
completely purebred lines, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: actually know what you're going to get
100% of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have a little bit of difference
in flower or height or bud density.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in general, just take in cuttings
allows for a more even canopy throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: your whole process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on top of that, if you go into
tissue culture, what you start to see is
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants now you can culture out of
viruses, you can culture out of insects,
[SPEAKER_02]: other pathogens, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way, instead of taking just the
cutting where you might have a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of contamination or something else that
goes on where your cutting has a root rot,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say, you don't deal with any of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's strictly growing a plant that started
off super healthy and accelerating the
[SPEAKER_02]: growth to, I'd say, it's comparable to a
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that extra 20% bonus on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you mentioned viruses
because here on the medicinal genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: side, we're working with testing labs and
cultivators to develop some assays in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to test plants for certain viruses,
mainly popsulate and viroid and lettuce,
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorosis virus and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cryptic virus as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there is a way to sort of
tissue culture of that virus if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering if you could kind of
explain to me how exactly does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually using an assay like that,
I could see being super beneficial and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll kind of touch on that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're going to culture out of a
virus, you need to understand what the
[SPEAKER_02]: meristem of a plant is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't understand what a meristem
is, your failure rate is going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: A meristem is the smallest new growth of
cells essentially that the plant creates
[SPEAKER_02]: that is undifferentiated tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't know yet if it's going to be a
shoot, a root, a leaf, those sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a mass cluster of cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only reason it cultures,
quote unquote, out of a virus is the virus
[SPEAKER_02]: has not had time to actually infect that
brand new batch of cells, which is why
[SPEAKER_02]: you're always taking from the smallest
amounts possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take something that has everything,
including a little bit more than the
[SPEAKER_02]: meristem, there's a good chance you
haven't actually cultured out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if you pulled it out of culture,
you grew it out, you might not see the
[SPEAKER_02]: virus express until you took cuttings a
second time potentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So testing for that's extremely crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always would recommend a molecular
test at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just tried to do it by visualizing
or visual identification, I could see a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of failure running into problems down
the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely strips or molecular type
stuff, if that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it seems that it's really
critical that you take just that little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit off the very end of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or where exactly on the plant are you
taking that cutting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it at the tip or is it somewhere else?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd actually recommend if you really want
to look into it to Google what a meristem
[SPEAKER_02]: is, it's spelled M-E-R-I-S-T-E-M.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially it can be there's root
meristems, there's shoot meristems.
[SPEAKER_02]: The definition I think is something along
the lines of the newest growth point on a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's right where anytime you see new
tissue coming out, it would be right
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have lateral meristems, auxiliary
meristems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just that brand new growth point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend if I were to take a new
bit of cuttings or a new tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: from a meristem cut, I would use the very
top of the plant right where the normal
[SPEAKER_02]: bud would form or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen a lot of success with root
meristem cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how small are we talking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this like a grain of rice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut a grain of rice into maybe eighths.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're taking a bit of tissue about
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need a microscope in order to do
it, at least if you want to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: accurately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some people kind of eyeball it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess if you really wanted to try
and it was your first time or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: that may be a semi acceptable method.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not going to guarantee accuracy
unless you have that like dissection
[SPEAKER_02]: microscope or something even a little
stronger potentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you can actually focus on pulling
back the leaf primordia to get to that
[SPEAKER_02]: main meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaf primordia are the new leaves that
form before they actually form a true leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: that you'd see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very precise process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did watch your CanMed 2019
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The video is up on canmedevents.com for
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage them to take a look at that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with you and really a lot of
the other presenters, I think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get across so much information
and you're trying to pack in so many
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, me not being a cultivation
expert, I did get lost a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy that I have you here and I
can kind of slow things down a bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of walk you the things that didn't
quite connect in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you did do a great job though of going
through the four different stages of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was hoping if you might forgive me,
but if you wouldn't mind sort of going
[SPEAKER_00]: through those a bit again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are four main stages that most
people would think of as tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do them out of order if you want
to, which is why the definitions get a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit blurred in between the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off,
but let's kind of continue as if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: taken the sample, that Meristem,
and now we want to just take it through
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that would be a good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you'd do is you'd take that
Meristem and right before you do anything
[SPEAKER_02]: with it, you'd actually take a little bit
bigger amount of tissue and you'd run it
[SPEAKER_02]: through a solution of about I'd say 10 to
20% bleach, depending on how long you let
[SPEAKER_02]: it sit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different protocols for different
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to stay around the 10 to 15,
but you could go as high as 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mix it with a chemical called
tween 20, which is just imagine a soap
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much what it is that doesn't
change the ionic properties, meaning it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't change your pH or mix with
anything in a weird way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It literally is just something they use in
beauty products or shampoos or tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you take your bleach, you mix it with
your tween 20 to let it penetrate the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant tissue a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just scrubs and kills anything that
might be on the surface of the tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your bleach concentration is too high,
you actually get a bleaching of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tissue loses its chlorophyll
pigments and it just turns white.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you damage the tissue before
you put it in the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all called the initiation stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're cleaning the tissue, you're getting
it prepped, and then you're putting it
[SPEAKER_02]: into the test tube for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That generally can take a good hour to get
ready if you're taking your time,
[SPEAKER_02]: really making sure everything's set,
doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just even rinsing the plant, I would
always run it under water at first before
[SPEAKER_02]: I even added the bleach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way any bacteria or fungus that
might have easily been knocked off just
[SPEAKER_02]: gave it that little bit more extra
agitation that you could use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all that's the initiation stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sorry, if I might stop you there,
did I hear you correct saying that in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to the Maristem, you're taking
another tissue sample?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all part of the same tissue
sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take something bigger when you surface
sterilize your tissue, and then you cut it
[SPEAKER_02]: down once it's underneath your hood in
that sterile environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine initiation would be that you go
out to the greenhouse or the grow or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is, you cut the little top
part off your plant, and you bring back,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say a fairly large cutting just to
make it easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that point, I would cut it down to
maybe a half an inch or so, something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, if I was gonna start with Maristem
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I'd kind of run it through
the sink for a while, really get all the
[SPEAKER_02]: agitation going, try and get some
bacteria, fungus, or anything else that
[SPEAKER_02]: might be on there to kind of release and
let go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd run it through that bleach
solution, the 20% bleach with the tween,
[SPEAKER_02]: the 20%, I generally would use like a drop
or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going out into the
greenhouse with your microscope and taking
[SPEAKER_00]: off that little piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point, you're gonna be moving
it to a sterile laminar flow hood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very different from a fume hood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fume hoods suck fumes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laminar flow hoods filter, vacuums have a
HEPA filter on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laminar fume hoods or laminar flow hoods
have a HEPA filter on them as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it basically pushes the air through
that filter and sterilizes all the air
[SPEAKER_02]: that goes through it because the particle
sizes for those filters are so small that
[SPEAKER_02]: the bacterial spores or the fungal spores
literally just can't penetrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get caught up in there and get stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're now blowing clean, very fresh
air at yourself and onto your plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: onto your cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the point where you have
sterile water prepped and things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically take your plant out of your
bleach solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do like a triple rinse in sterile
water to make sure no other pathogens are
[SPEAKER_02]: present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take sterile scalpel blades
and you really cut down all the primordial
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cut everything off until you get to
that very small meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's generally a very small cluster of
cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you place that in your media.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is all the initiation stage right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all getting the plant from the
greenhouse all the way into a test tube
[SPEAKER_02]: for the first time in a sterile
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a couple steps where you just
have to keep making sure you're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaner and cleaner as you go and you
don't accidentally contaminate anything in
[SPEAKER_02]: the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, because as you mentioned in your
presentation, you're basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: putting the sample into a culture that is
favorable for growing, not just cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but pretty much anything else too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's any sort of microbial
contamination that comes along with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to grow and probably take over
the culture, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually going to touch on that
really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized when I was doing that
presentation, I didn't really explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are things like penicillin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They develop by seeing two different,
a fungus and a bacteria compete.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they realized there was an anti,
I think it was a bacterial at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: present.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't quote me on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long story short, though, is they use
those antibiotics in the culture media to
[SPEAKER_02]: get rid of a specific bacteria,
a specific thing like that in,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say, bacteria media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas tissue culture media, since you're
growing a plant, you generally don't add
[SPEAKER_02]: antibiotics in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can affect how the plant hormones are
produced or how the plant actually grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to remove all the variables,
you just leave it out, making it a prime
[SPEAKER_02]: environment for the bacteria or the
fungus, depending on what you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: to actually either come out of your plant
from endophytes or just come out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface tissue if it wasn't quite
sterilized properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have we covered initiation?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all initiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So multiplication, this step's super easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you're doing is initiation,
you're growing that maristim or that
[SPEAKER_02]: auxiliary node just a little bit further
to the point where you can take more
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you can take more cuttings,
you just, you take them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to go through the whole
bleach process again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just split those up into other
vessels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I generally would use test tubes when I
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I reference test tubes, just realize
it's a culture vessel in some way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sterilized vessel that has been
pre- decontaminated, and you're now
[SPEAKER_02]: putting the plant in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Media's already in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already prepped everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just expanding your plant mass
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: The max I got from one 25-millimeter test
tube in diameter was, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 to 30 cuts off the one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are these basically the same size as
that original maristim sample?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all, because the initial
maristim, if you can culture out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: virus, past that point, all the other
tissue you're culturing will be
[SPEAKER_02]: virus-free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't need to keep going through
that process every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will also mention, if you take a
maristim culture, you do have the chance
[SPEAKER_02]: of mutation, because the maristim,
if it mutates, that's where you see weird
[SPEAKER_02]: variable changes in the leaf tissue,
how stuff might look, how stuff might
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because you're taking such a small
amount of cells, when it goes to grow out,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say, another shoot, you might have
missed some of that mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have changed it up slightly
because you didn't take the full maristim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're taking those cuttings off
that original tissue culture, so how big
[SPEAKER_00]: is it at this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much has it grown?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's variable based off your container.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, I'd have something,
because I was using the test tubes,
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 millimeters in diameter kind of crammed
in there, and maybe three inches tall,
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still fairly small though,
and you just keep cutting every single
[SPEAKER_02]: node that popped off into a new tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so is the idea that this tissue
culture is just going to continually grow
[SPEAKER_00]: off new shoots that you're just going to
be cutting off and then putting into a new
[SPEAKER_00]: tube?
[SPEAKER_02]: For simple terms, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to preface that with, that only
lasts for so long before you get weird
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic mutations that go on, because the
plant has not had a chance to express all
[SPEAKER_02]: its genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get into that here too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about multiplication and
everything, but once you hit that fifth
[SPEAKER_02]: generation or so is what I've been told of
multiplication, you definitely start to
[SPEAKER_02]: run into a lot of other issues where
genetic deformities might happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might stunt your plant growth because
it has not had that time to develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's normal natural processes,
whether that's a terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially a smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might need a certain nutrient that it's
not quite getting in the nutrients that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're constantly providing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always making my own nutrients when
I do this, and so I would use,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was 28 different bottles of,
let's say, ammonium nitrate or
[SPEAKER_02]: monopotassium phosphate, just the
individual chemicals that would build up
[SPEAKER_02]: that fertilizer in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you miss one or the concentration's
not high enough, that's what I'm more
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start to run into an issue over
multiple generations where it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: missing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long can you typically keep on
going?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to do transfers roughly every two
to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sooner the better, because then your
media doesn't degrade something like iron
[SPEAKER_02]: in your media.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was light sensitive, and so the light
would start to break it down, and you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: run into issues of the plant being
deficient in iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: The longest I had a culture sitting at
room temperature, I think, was about nine
[SPEAKER_02]: to ten months without touching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started to do a couple weird things at
certain points and then push new growth
[SPEAKER_02]: and induce more.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say weird things, generate callus,
kind of like you'd see right after you try
[SPEAKER_02]: rooting a cutting, how the bottom kind of
bulges out and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it hasn't quite built roots yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That same sort of tissue starts to form
after the plant's been in the media for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hormones change up enough to allow it
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now will it continue to grow over that
nine months, or is it sort of in a weird
[SPEAKER_00]: suspension?
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll grow a little bit, but it's mostly
in suspension at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of culture that just sits there for
a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have all that nitrogen
constantly being pushing or pushing it to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow, so you're lacking the nutrients it
actually needs to really bulk up and get
[SPEAKER_02]: huge very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be covered, multiplication.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other thing I'm going to talk
about there is during the initiation and
[SPEAKER_02]: multiplication stages, you're going to be
using generally the same hormone or some
[SPEAKER_02]: hormone blend fairly similar, where you
use something called a cytokinin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It causes growth of the stem, mostly,
rather than expansion of the leaves and or
[SPEAKER_02]: rooting so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're just trying to form more and
more stem bits and more lateral nodes to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of form, rather than trying to get
your plant to root or get everything
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say bigger, I'm talking,
imagine you have a leaf that is really
[SPEAKER_02]: stressed, it'll remain smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it gets more oxen, that leaf,
it'll become huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been kind of surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the cultures I get out,
if I added too much oxen, one of them
[SPEAKER_02]: would be the size of my pinky nail,
and then another leaf might be the size of
[SPEAKER_02]: my thumb if it had more oxen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just random things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'll touch on that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about germinating some
seeds and tubes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another bit that kind of goes hand
in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's initiation and multiplication
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we move on to rooting,
correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rooting, this was one of the hardest
stages I found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go to root, I recommended it at
CanMed too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still in this mindset of look at the
rooting hormones you're constantly using
[SPEAKER_02]: on your plants, not using tissue culture,
and basically try and mimic those rooting
[SPEAKER_02]: hormones inside culture conditions or in
vitro conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get a much more accurate,
quick way to root a plant if you use that
[SPEAKER_02]: as your baseline to kind of start.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody's curious that's listening to
this, I had about 2.5 microliters of IBA
[SPEAKER_02]: and about 0.5 microliters or less of NAA.
[SPEAKER_02]: That helps you out at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took about anywhere from two weeks to
four weeks to actually see roots starting
[SPEAKER_02]: to form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely not the fastest I've ever
seen in culture, but one of the fastest
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forgive me again, stupid question,
but during this multiplication step,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are no roots being formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just growing new stems and new
shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that's a pretty fair way to say
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not growing any roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only growing shoots because of the
cytokinin concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, for anybody listening,
I would go with two IP at about 2.5
[SPEAKER_02]: microliters and I'd also add NAA at about
0.3 microliters and you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: your best initiation multiplication media
that I've found so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that helps at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've gotten roots to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're putting them in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just pull them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used soil, I've used rock wool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially what you just got to remember
is you're taking a plant that's had pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much a hundred percent humidity and you're
putting it in a condition with less than
[SPEAKER_02]: 50% humidity generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really got to make sure to keep
that humidity level up close to 80 or 90%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then slowly taper it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully by the end of the week,
you can get it back to about the climate
[SPEAKER_02]: that you'd look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it might take up to two weeks on
certain varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then once it's sort of established,
it grows as if it were sort of a seedling,
[SPEAKER_00]: correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed or a clone.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's important to keep in mind,
right, when you pull it out of the tube,
[SPEAKER_02]: it acts a lot like an unrooted clone,
even if it has roots, just because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not used to that super low humidity on the
top part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from initiation to chopping it down and
processing it, how long is that process?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get it down to under a month if
you have everything set up, lined up
[SPEAKER_02]: right, whatever, just to get it into
tissue culture and out of tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you start with the plant
generally about the size of your thumb or
[SPEAKER_02]: so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a couple inches tall, nothing too
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The benefit of tissue culture in this
sense is that that initiation stage that
[SPEAKER_02]: might take two weeks to get, you then have
enough tissue that you can constantly cut
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 more, let's say, or even seven or eight
more or something along those lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on what blend you use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exponential propagation for every two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get, let's say, 25 more, five times in
a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go from something like one cutting
to, let's say, 10 cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those 10 cuttings turn into 100 cuttings
two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those 100 cuttings turn into 1,000
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see how that just kind of
explodes extremely quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's if you're not accounting for loss
or contamination or anything else,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have a perfect run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it kind of makes that entry versus
exit stage a little bit trickier because
[SPEAKER_02]: every time you do this, you're waiting at
least another two weeks before you can cut
[SPEAKER_02]: and or change your media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say you're at that 1,000 cuttings
and you've done all the initiation,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the multiplication.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just take all those cuttings,
you change the media to accommodate more
[SPEAKER_02]: of a rooting, which would mean you can up
your thymine levels, you can change your
[SPEAKER_02]: cytokinins into more of an oxen,
such as IBA, to really get it to root.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same way that if you took a cutting,
you dip it in the rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exact same concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point, you have all these
plants that are in culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You now have dipped them all in your
rooting hormone to keep this kind of easy
[SPEAKER_02]: to follow along.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it takes anywhere from two to four
weeks to really start seeing roots form on
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you see the roots,
you put them in a container or media,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you would, just like a normal
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the number of plants you can
get out of a tissue culture sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: compare to taking cuttings from a mother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get more from a tissue culture,
more from a mother, or is that sort of not
[SPEAKER_00]: an easy question to answer?
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue culture, you have exponentially
more every couple of weeks, whereas a
[SPEAKER_02]: mother plant, you need to grow that out
for roughly a month or two to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say, if the mother plant's huge,
even a couple hundred cuttings off it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that in tissue culture in a
fraction of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're mixing your own media and
you're not pre-buying it in, stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you can get your media cost down to
about one to four cents a tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so rather than buying the clone cube,
which generally would even cost like a
[SPEAKER_02]: quarter a piece or something, you've
dropped that down to three cents a piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making it so hard to even compare the two
tissue culture is by far more efficient,
[SPEAKER_02]: more effective, and cheaper to do in the
long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: The downside is to set up a lab and to
train somebody in sterile technique and
[SPEAKER_02]: all that can be a little bit of a pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will also mention I have done tissue
culture at my house using my stove to
[SPEAKER_02]: sterilize stuff and basically doing it in
the heat of the stove as quickly as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible and still had decent amounts of
success.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though I'm talking about this like
it's something you need a lab and all
[SPEAKER_02]: this, if you just want to try it,
you can do it at your house as long as you
[SPEAKER_02]: clean all your surfaces first and kind of
wipe down your counters and make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's somewhat sterile if you're
able to do it somewhat quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can promise you based on my previous
experience cultivating that I would not be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just want to, as I say,
try it, you can spend $10 and even see if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's something that interests you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are there commercial grows that are
using this method?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know of many that have it as their
full, that's how they're doing everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's definitely a gamble
every single time you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say I was at a facility one time
where the roof above me kept getting
[SPEAKER_02]: flooded by, the grow was above me at the
time and my contamination rates started to
[SPEAKER_02]: exponentially increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started out an okay area to store my
cultures and by the end of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just turned into this, we'll call it a
cesspool where every single thing I was
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do just got contaminated like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what about outside of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other crops or flowers that sort
of use this technique?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pineapples, grapes, I've done it with some
orchids, geraniums, heuchera, phlox.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really you can do it with pretty
much any plant you want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your success is variable, but yeah,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even on a commercial scale,
are they using it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how a lot of orchids are actually
staying alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some orchids, they don't really like to
propagate too much and you can't just
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate a seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires a special fungus in order for
it to even germinate in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're finding by using tissue
culture, you can actually just grow them
[SPEAKER_02]: like you normally would want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the biggest benefits is
just constant storage and recovery of
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics that are very hard to either grow
from seed and or get enough cuttings of.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other example I'd have there is
heuchera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing a heuchera propagation in
tissue culture at one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to get four cuttings of
heuchera, you needed to grow the plant out
[SPEAKER_02]: for like a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, if you wanted to do it in tissue
culture, you'd grow the plant out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd take your four cuttings,
you'd try and get meristematic tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from those four cuttings,
maybe two to three weeks later,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could get another 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all of a sudden you weren't waiting
like crazy just to get the couple few
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings that you actually wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that you touched on,
I think when you were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: orchids was this idea of germinating seeds
in a culture medium, which you had
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned before too and said you were
going to get back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to make sure I brought that
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, there's two parts to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one called green pod sowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's actual just seed
germination and green pod sowing is you
[SPEAKER_02]: take an immature seed, which just hasn't
developed the entire seed coat,
[SPEAKER_02]: but does have a live embryo in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you basically cut out the embryo,
drop it in your culture media,
[SPEAKER_02]: and grow it just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because your culture media has all the
nutrients, hormones, and vitamins the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant needs to grow, it's essentially
exactly what the seed coat would provide,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is all the nutrients, hormones,
and vitamins in order for the plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: even germinate and start producing the
correct tissues in the correct spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the interesting experiments I
actually did when I was doing seed
[SPEAKER_02]: germination on cannabis specifically was I
took 2,4-D, which is an actual herbicide
[SPEAKER_02]: or a synthetic oxen depending on your
concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I added it to my culture media just to
see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually grew the seeds upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the roots were in the air and the
shoots started growing into the media
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was a non-polar oxen I figured
out, meaning it didn't know up from down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that kind of interesting when I
was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to take the embryo out
before it forms that seed coat,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are some of the advantages of doing
it that way?
[SPEAKER_02]: The big one that I would see is mostly for
breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of having to grow your plant for
that entire, let's say, 60 days or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it would generally take to get
your seed, you can cut that time down as
[SPEAKER_02]: soon as the pollen hits it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wait, let's say, a week, a week and a
half, and you should be able to cut those
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds straight out, put them in your
media, and actually get them to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: because the embryo is formed without the
seed coat at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could significantly accelerate
your program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could cut months out of each cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that case, you could do,
especially if you're pulling them straight
[SPEAKER_02]: out of culture and flowering them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I've also seen people develop pollen
sacks and or flowers in culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can reduce your, let's say,
three month, four month grow time down to
[SPEAKER_02]: a three to four week grow time,
which you can see the advantages there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing that you did touch on in
your presentation that I wanted to ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: about was this idea of dark rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you shared an interesting story about
how you kind of came up with the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was hoping you could maybe retell
that story and tell people about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually ran across this by accident
completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had cut down some plants one day that we
just decided, you know, they were in
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative growth phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were not in flowering at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we just didn't want the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just extra.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might have been male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't exactly remember the circumstance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I cut them way down low right next to
where the root system would start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were all these little white dots
at the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure, you know, people have seen these
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really think anything of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a lot of light little things on
the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know it's part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took that plant, shoved it in a black 55
gallon trash bag, and got carried away
[SPEAKER_02]: with some other project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long story short is they sat in the corner
of a grow room for about a week,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a week and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went back there just to stay
compliant, get them out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I decided to open the bag just to see,
you know, does it smell funny?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is something rotting in here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And right when I opened it, I saw new
little root hairs protruding out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be considered a callus growth at
that point of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right where all those little dots are,
way down low, right next to your root
[SPEAKER_02]: ball, where the water continues to rise
and lower and rise and lower, that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, I saw maybe centimeter long roots
coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that that happened without
the plants having any light whatsoever,
[SPEAKER_02]: no water, no nutrients, all I did was keep
the humidity up like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant just naturally wanted to
throw out roots right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided, well, if that works outside of
tissue culture, why not try it in tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some experience with other hard to
root plants and growing them in the dark
[SPEAKER_02]: for the first week or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to get the top tissue to not die
off and the roots would start to push a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gave it a shot on cannabis and it did
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say it was hugely
successful because I saw quite a few
[SPEAKER_02]: issues such as the roots didn't always
grow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They lost that polarity because I'm
guessing the light has something to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with knowing which direction to travel
polarity-wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually know that for a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a common thing you learn in plant
physiology, where a long time ago to
[SPEAKER_02]: determine oxens, they took a candle up to
a plant and they saw which direction the
[SPEAKER_02]: stem would lean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the experiment essentially taught them
what an oxen was and how to, or that it
[SPEAKER_02]: would break down under light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when your oxen, your rooting hormone
essentially, breaks down under light,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have less of it naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you see a lot of people that
start to add charcoal into their rooting
[SPEAKER_02]: media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the charcoal is actually mostly a way
to prevent light from hitting your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: tissues and prevent something called
phenolic exudation, which is, I like to
[SPEAKER_02]: think of it as the plants doing chemical
warfare and trying to suffocate or kill
[SPEAKER_02]: any other plants or funguses or whatever
around it by excreting toxic chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem is if it's growing in its
own tube by itself, those toxic chemicals
[SPEAKER_02]: come back to kill it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rooting in the Dark, the entire point
of this for me was I saw an application
[SPEAKER_02]: with tissue culture and being able to ship
these cultures in a sealed, enclosed,
[SPEAKER_02]: sterile environment in the mail where they
could get knocked around quite a bit and
[SPEAKER_02]: you could chuck the package or whatever
and you wouldn't lose your culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant wouldn't die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time it got from point A to its
destination at point B, you still had a
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy plant that was alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you had just done those cultures
and shipped it, they would have either
[SPEAKER_02]: just started to root or be fully rooted by
the time they reached their destination
[SPEAKER_02]: without even using priority mail.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that would be an interesting
application for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, why take all this time to
try and ship a clone dome that's all,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need it lit and you need to worry
about all your cuttings inside,
[SPEAKER_02]: not having an insect on them or anything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're already sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you do is throw it in the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually kind of tying into
automation of tissue culture if you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: mind talking about that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the big things was if you try
and ship all these, you'd obviously want
[SPEAKER_02]: to automate your process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could just mass ship and you could
have one company or one project where all
[SPEAKER_02]: you're focused on instead of taking mother
plants and all that is growing out small
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, amassing them in tissue culture
using stage two, that multiplication
[SPEAKER_02]: stage, and then shipping them off to other
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at their facilities, they can harden
them off and do things like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: which would mean there's certain things
I've seen such as media pouring
[SPEAKER_02]: applications, which take and pump media
in, let's say, eight cells wide by 20
[SPEAKER_02]: cells long or something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can then seal it up with a piece
of saran wrap or vacuum sealed,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you want to call it, just a clear
plastic film on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that point, it's sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ship them without any really big
human inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have a machine with a robot arm go
and take your cuttings and place them in
[SPEAKER_02]: your culture media themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have a machine that filled all your
culture media and sealed everything after
[SPEAKER_02]: the robot arm went and stuck all the
culture and then ship them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually, I've started at this
company, Olsen's Greenhouse, and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the largest in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're the 10th largest right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm actually running their propagation
department.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the application I could see for tissue
culture in the cannabis industry is fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a device called a boom,
a watering boom, which is just mist
[SPEAKER_02]: nozzles that have such a fine mist.
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep the humidity up on your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we were to, let's say, buy in tissue
culture and keep these boom mist nozzles
[SPEAKER_02]: running over the plants every five minutes
to start with, we could actually pull the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants from the in vitro cultured vessels,
stick them in the plug trays or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: we wanted to use our maybe two and a half
inch pots or three inch pots and just keep
[SPEAKER_02]: them alive with the mist in order to fully
grow the plants and harden them off all at
[SPEAKER_02]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it cuts down on a ton of taking the
cuttings, having mom plants around,
[SPEAKER_02]: worrying about all the pathogens that come
along with that and allow companies to
[SPEAKER_02]: just buy in their cultures straight,
buy in their plants straight, have a
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent type, know they're insect and
pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know the company is doing Maristom
culture, you can also guarantee virus
[SPEAKER_02]: free, especially if they're testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'm gonna mention that the
application of the assays that you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing, that is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize you were doing that until
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, I would highly recommend
talking to tissue culture growers on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see a huge application for all the
different virus tests that you would
[SPEAKER_02]: perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that sounds amazing actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of cultivators sort of just
getting a flat of all these tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures and then kind of putting them
underneath the mist, hardening them off
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're off to the races.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would certainly be quite the
operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the advantage of that over
clonedomes, because I know a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people, especially probably listening
really like clonedomes, you tend to have
[SPEAKER_02]: stagnant air, which can develop more
pathogen issues on your tissue,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that, versus a mist bench or a
mist system, which would essentially lay
[SPEAKER_02]: water on the tissue and then let it dry
out, preventing huge pathogen buildups
[SPEAKER_02]: over time for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I guess that's an interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are these plants any more susceptible
to contamination than a plant that was
[SPEAKER_00]: grown right from seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is genetic variety dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some call them strains are gonna be
different than other strains and the
[SPEAKER_02]: insects they draw, the pathogens they get,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, with a seed, you can still
have a bacteria or a virus inside the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: code itself, in the embryo itself before
you even germinate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tissue culture is probably a better
method actually to ensure virus pathogen
[SPEAKER_02]: and insect-free plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to be mindful of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk about this for seemingly all
day, but I do want to be mindful of your
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I let you go, I wanted to give
you an opportunity to plug the company
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're working for, any social media
or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So currently I'm working for one of the
largest greenhouses in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_02]: Olson's Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now they're cultivating plants
mostly for Walmart and Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not really doing a whole lot with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to follow my Instagram,
you're more than welcome to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at Kamachi, K-O-M-A-T-C-H-I-I.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try and post some interesting plant
pictures every once in a while,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's about it for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I let you go, I do want to
thank you for being one of our scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: advisors for CanMed this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been a big help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking through all the different
abstracts for folks who are looking to

[SPEAKER_00]: So we do want to thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do look forward to seeing you out
at the event in Pasadena.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to get that started up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: April 12th through 14th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.

[SPEAKER_00]: Stay safe, stay healthy, and be sure to
come back for the next episode of CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, I got to speak with Dr.
Marion McNabb, who is the president of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Center of Excellence and CEO of
Cannabis Community Care and Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marion is a public health doctor by
training and has nearly 20 years of global
[SPEAKER_00]: and domestic public health experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her team recently completed a veterans
health and medical cannabis research study
[SPEAKER_00]: with the goal of gathering information
from U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: military veterans regarding their current
health conditions, conventional medical
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments, medical cannabis use,
and its effectiveness with self-reported
[SPEAKER_00]: health conditions and symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a lot about the veterans study
as well as other public health topics
[SPEAKER_00]: related to medical cannabis, including how
military veterans use cannabis to treat a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of conditions to reduce dependence
on other medications, what barriers
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans face when trying to access
medical cannabis, what programs have been
[SPEAKER_00]: established to assist veterans with the
cost of cannabis medicine, how does
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans use of medical cannabis compared
to the general population, how has the
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID-19 pandemic changed cannabis use in
terms of frequency, purchasing habits,
[SPEAKER_00]: and conditions, how implementing proper
testing led to the eventual lift of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vape ban in Massachusetts, and how the
vote to legalize adult use cannabis in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Jersey affects the issues of public
health, social justice, and advocacy in
[SPEAKER_00]: that state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get to that conversation,
I do want to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Science and Technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Science and Technology is proud
to present a special supplement and free
[SPEAKER_00]: virtual Veterans Day eSymposium focused on
medical cannabis treatment for veterans
[SPEAKER_00]: with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The supplement and symposium will feature
Dr. Marion McNabb and the data she
[SPEAKER_00]: uncovered in her 2019 Veterans Health and
Medical Cannabis Study.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the supplement will include
articles with Dr. Stacy Gruber,
[SPEAKER_00]: veteran patient Stephen Mandil,
a VA caregiver, a nurse, and medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis advocates all heavily involved
with this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eSymposium will also feature a special
panel discussion organized by Stephen
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandil with the group of veterans from
across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Cannabis Science, Tech.com to learn
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, it wouldn't be the Can Med
Coffee Talk podcast without the Hemp in
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee Exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know, hemp coffee is a
healthy, delicious, natural product,
[SPEAKER_00]: rich in trace minerals and nutrients,
providing sustained energy without the
[SPEAKER_00]: crash of regular coffee.
