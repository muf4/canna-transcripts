[SPEAKER_00]: So you recently wrote an article on
LinkedIn explaining some of the challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: for this potency loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of kicked it off saying that
you did a poll of your followers to asking
[SPEAKER_00]: what they think is the most important
factor in, you know, preventing potency
[SPEAKER_00]: loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seemed like most people thought it
was sort of this emulsion technology or
[SPEAKER_00]: the infusion technology, which is what you
were describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, do you agree with that
assessment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why do you think people think that
that is the most important?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen issues of the downstream
potency issues happening and the root
[SPEAKER_01]: cause could be the emulsion, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen that, but I also have seen
many other areas along the supply chain of
[SPEAKER_01]: making a kind of beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: When any of the sector has issues or
problems, the accumulated effect is
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing to the end results,
which is potency loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, the infusion tech is very
important because it's complex,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the infusion tech itself needs to
be stable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you put that infusion tech,
the emotion or whatever technology into
[SPEAKER_01]: the beverages, it needs to be stable in a
beverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the self stability and the beverage
stability are two aspects, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it's hard to assume you have
a stable emotion by itself and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have a stable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we have seen this failure time and
time again, and you have to really assess
[SPEAKER_01]: the two lanes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have a stable emotion,
but also this is the most interesting part
[SPEAKER_01]: and complex part because emotion could be
two to three formulas or four formulas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be a thousand SKUs,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They are having different pHs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have different ingredients,
heat stability, packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really the wild part of expanding
the emotion into the finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where Vertosa actually spent a
lot of time understanding our clients from
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what kind of beverage formulation
they are, what kind of packaging,
[SPEAKER_01]: co-manufacturers, a testing lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you're going to dive into it,
but that's essentially the whole supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain that could potentially impact the
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, and you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into kind of the
different parts of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get onto that, I wanted to
ask, so when we're talking about losing
[SPEAKER_00]: potency, how much are we talking about
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there sort of a standard rate of
potency loss?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask me the standards, for
beverages, there are regulated beverages
[SPEAKER_01]: by states and there are hemp beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you ask by state by state,
there is a 10 to 15% variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the label claim, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you ask me about hemp beverages so
far, there is no strict regulation yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So which the industry, I know they're
advocating for better regulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: better standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the hemp beverages could have a
huge loss over the shelf life,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The shelf life the brands claim and some
brands may have not as much loss over the
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some brands may have a huge loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see this huge difference and we see
there's a big need for the industry to
[SPEAKER_01]: better ourselves because consumers love
this product and consumers need this
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we don't do a good job,
if we lose the trust of consumers and they
[SPEAKER_01]: say, okay, all those hemp beverages are
finicky and they don't give me enough
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams on the claim, I think that's
detrimental to the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to lead the conversation and
educate our partners and clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you need to pay attention to all the
details that leads to potency loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just assume you had a good
emotion, you have a good co-manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_01]: then everything's fine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we wanna try to educate
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to imagine with so many
different brands out there and so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different products, using so many
different technologies without sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: that standardization, like you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some consumers might experience a
potency loss with one brand and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: apply that to everyone else where that's
not really the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the history will, we're early,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 2024, we're early in this cannabis
beverage sector and more research are
[SPEAKER_01]: needed, more regulation are needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm strongly advocate for those to
happen.
Okay.
