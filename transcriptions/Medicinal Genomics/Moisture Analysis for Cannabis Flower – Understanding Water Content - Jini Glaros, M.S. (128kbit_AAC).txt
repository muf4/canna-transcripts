[SPEAKER_02]: Hi everyone and welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Jenny Gleros and I am the CSO
at Modern Kana Labs which is a third-party
[SPEAKER_02]: testing laboratory located here in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I want to talk to you about a topic
that I am very passionate about from the
[SPEAKER_02]: lab testing side of things because I think
it is very important for what we do in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and also very important for
cultivators to be able to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a cultivator or you're a
grower, your lab, a lot of labs are
[SPEAKER_02]: reporting anywhere from 12 to 15 percent
moisture in flour and a study we have
[SPEAKER_02]: conducted has proved that this may not be
a true representation of water content in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's dive right in.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is moisture?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the FDA, USFS, NOAA, IFT and EPA all
define moisture as the water content that
[SPEAKER_02]: is present in a sample, so looking solely
at water.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much water is there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis creates some difficulty because
it is volatile, has lots of volatile and
[SPEAKER_02]: semi-volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have cannabinoids, we have terpenes,
we have flavonoids, we have a lot of other
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds present that may or may not be
factored into those moisture calculations
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on how you're analyzing for
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of where our study
originated from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So AOAC is an organization that's a
standards organization and they are in the
[SPEAKER_02]: process of creating a cannabis PT and with
this cannabis PT and hemp PT, it's a real
[SPEAKER_02]: life sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the PT's on the market,
you have to do manipulation of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to change them, you don't follow
your standard protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is different because it is a real
life sample coming in and you process it
[SPEAKER_02]: as you would a normal sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the AOAC pilot data, we saw that
labs reported moistures anywhere from 6%
[SPEAKER_02]: to 16%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a pretty drastic range and even
the average range, looking at that three
[SPEAKER_02]: sigma data, ranges from about 9% to almost
14%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still a really big range for
something that should be the same sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is why and how is that
happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we talk about the different
techniques for analyzing for moisture,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to paint a picture for why it's
important to understand water content and
[SPEAKER_02]: what the impact is of varying moisture
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here I have a table that's going to
show you various analytes and the impact
[SPEAKER_02]: that moisture and dry weight correction
has on those results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at something like total
THC, we see we have an as received value
[SPEAKER_02]: of 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the lab tested it as.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they dry weight correct that to 5%,
that number goes up to 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then to 7%, that number goes up to 21.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if they go to 15%, that number is
suddenly 23.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a cultivator or producer,
you of course want that 15% moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're going to get a higher THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, is this an accurate
representation?
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the same thing happening with
terpenes where an as received terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: value may be 1.5% and by time you dry
weight correct that to 15%, you're now
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing 1.76% moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have some contaminants listed
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And contaminants kind of are the double
edged sword of moisture corrections,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're looking at arsenic,
in Florida the regulatory limit for
[SPEAKER_02]: arsenic is 200 ppb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this sample, a lab received and had
an as received value of 180 ppb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they dry weight correct that to
15% moisture, that value is now 212.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now a producer is failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really need to understand an
accurate moisture content in order to get
[SPEAKER_02]: an accurate reported value for producers,
growers on what their sample actually
[SPEAKER_02]: would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a pesticide example here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing the same thing, that regulatory
limit is 3,000 ppb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see that if that as received sample
came in at 2,700, it's failing if the lab
[SPEAKER_02]: is reporting a 15% moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can you analyze for moisture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a variety of techniques in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've included five of the main
techniques here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first we have Carl Fisher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have vacuum oven, vacuum
desiccation, loss on drying, at high
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, and loss on drying at low
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the next few slides, we're going to
cover all of these and give you a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a deeper explanation of how each of
them are done.
[SPEAKER_02]: First up, we have Carl Fisher titration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the gold standard of
botanicals and agricultural agents.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what labs are doing is they're
performing a titration on the sample in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to determine the amount of water
that's present based on a reaction that
[SPEAKER_02]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really nice about Carl Fisher is
because you're looking only at water
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules and the reaction of water
molecules, it prevents any of those
[SPEAKER_02]: volatile and semi-volatile compounds from
being factored into the moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: calculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, one of the big downsides is it
can be very expensive for laboratories to
[SPEAKER_02]: utilize.
[SPEAKER_02]: A Carl Fisher instrument can cost anywhere
from about $50,000 to $75,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have consumables that go with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So laboratories who are trying to make
money, chances are this is not a technique
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're going to be able to use and
still make money and profits on their
[SPEAKER_02]: samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then have vacuum oven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually from the European
Pharmacopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, the sample is placed in an
oven at a low temperature, in this
[SPEAKER_02]: instance, 40 degrees Celsius, under vacuum
for an extended time period to slowly
[SPEAKER_02]: evaporate all of the water from the
sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with this, we limit the loss of
volatile and semi-volatile compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're not heating it to a high
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, some of the negatives of this are
that the method does need to run for 24
[SPEAKER_02]: hours, which can decrease the lab's
throughput depending on the size of the
[SPEAKER_02]: vacuum oven that they're utilizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can only fit so many samples and
they have reruns, it can affect their
[SPEAKER_02]: turnaround times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have vacuum desiccation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is similar to the vacuum oven,
except for the fact that we're keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: things at room temperature and we're
utilizing desiccant to help dry it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a vacuum pump and a desiccator with
absorbent desiccant in the bottom,
[SPEAKER_02]: you then place your sample in there and
you suck off all of the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great because it prevents all of
the loss of those volatile and
[SPEAKER_02]: semi-volatile compounds by keeping it at
room temperature, or theoretically should
[SPEAKER_02]: help limit it the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, since that sample is not heated,
there is a chance that some of this water
[SPEAKER_02]: that's trapped is not going to be fully
removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to take that into consideration
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have loss on drying at high
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is pretty much the universal
standard of what laboratories are using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most laboratories in the industry are
using a loss on drying at high
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're doing here is they're
heating a sample to a high temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: normally above 103 degrees Celsius,
to remove the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, you see labs that heat anywhere
from 103 to 150, and that can impact those
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: The higher the temperature, the more the
volatiles you cook off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to understand that impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an effective way to do
moisture because you're ensuring all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the water is being removed, water boils,
at 100 degrees Celsius, and it's a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this temperature utilized is
drastically impacting those semi-volatile
[SPEAKER_02]: and volatile compounds that we know are so
prevalent in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have loss on drying at low
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this does is it's very similar to
that loss on drying at high temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: except we're limiting the temperature at
what we're heating the sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this instance, 80 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that is that we know
cannabinoids start to decarboxylate at
[SPEAKER_02]: about 85 degrees once they've sat for a
certain period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can prevent that decarboxylation of
cannabinoids by doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a quick process, so that's nice for
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the water should be evaporated
at 80 C.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this temperature does lead to
some loss of volatile and semi-volatile
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds because those terpenes,
if you smell them in the air, it's because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're volatilizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at 80 degrees, you're definitely going
to start volatilizing those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did we want to do to compare all
of these methods?
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately, we wanted to design an
experiment that was able to assess all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these methods at once on the same samples
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a really big complaint for
the industry, is that when you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this, oh, well, you analyzed Carl Fischer
on day one, but you analyzed loss on
[SPEAKER_02]: drying at day five.
[SPEAKER_02]: The moisture changes from day to day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how is this comparative?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's ultimately what we wanted to
eliminate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted a true comparative study of
samples the same day, the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: analyzed across all five of these methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the goal was to analyze at least 100
samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up with 120 samples total for
this experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we analyzed them via all five of those
moisture techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Carl Fischer, which was the oven was at
100 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vacuum oven, the oven was at 40 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vacuum desiccation at room temperature,
so 22 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loss on drying at high temperature at 103
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: And loss on drying at low temperature,
80 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also wanted to run each of the methods
nine times in order to get a comparison to
[SPEAKER_02]: measure the reproducibility and variance
from method to method.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the complaints we've heard in the
industry is that some of these methods,
[SPEAKER_02]: you run them and your results change
drastically from run to run across the
[SPEAKER_02]: same sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to see, are there any
concerns for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, the really big part of this
study was that we wanted to process a
[SPEAKER_02]: subset of the samples for cannabinoids and
terpenes pre and post analysis to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what is happening to the
product when you're drying it in these
[SPEAKER_02]: manners.
[SPEAKER_02]: What decarboxylation is occurring,
what terpene loss is occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the big overarching goal
was to truly understand what was happening
[SPEAKER_02]: to the chemical makeup of these samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first up, I'm just gonna show some
brief moisture comparisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just, we're gonna have three
slides of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I chose 45 of the 120 samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever you're looking at this,
you can see that those three bars that are
[SPEAKER_02]: about the same are gonna be the loss on
drying at low temperature, the vacuum oven
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Carl Fischer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for these across all 120 samples,
we saw an average moisture for,
[SPEAKER_02]: and these are all dried cured cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should all be fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when these arrived, we saw a average
moisture content across all 120 with the
[SPEAKER_02]: loss on drying at low temperature of 7.4%
moisture, the vacuum oven we saw 7.7%
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture and the Carl Fischer we saw 7.3%
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty impactful because across
all three of these methods, we're seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: very similar moisture as well within a
percent of each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when we're looking at the other
types of testing, so the vacuum
[SPEAKER_02]: desiccation is yielding an average overall
moisture of about 4% and the loss on
[SPEAKER_02]: drying at high temperature is yielding an
overall average moisture of about 12.5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a pretty big variance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is happening and why is this
happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we look at a sample through the
entire process comparing decarboxylation
[SPEAKER_02]: and terpenes, I wanted to do a quick
review of the reproducibility here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the reproducibility study
yielded that all of these methods really
[SPEAKER_02]: are reproducible within themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Labs, if they're running them,
should be able to get reproducible
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have standard deviations well within
the expected range of what a lab should
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are our initial takeaways?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our initial takeaways from this are that
the vacuum oven, the Carl Fischer,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the loss on drying at low temperature
methods all yielded results that are
[SPEAKER_02]: similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vacuum desiccation results appeared to
be skewed slightly low, about 2% to 3%
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to the other three methods that
were uniform with one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then loss on drying at high
temperature results appeared to be skewed
[SPEAKER_02]: high, about 4% to 5% compared to those
three methods yielding the similar data.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also no specific pattern amongst
those three similar methods of which
[SPEAKER_02]: resulted in a higher or a lower moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we weren't seeing a trend where Carl
Fischer was always the lowest or vacuum
[SPEAKER_02]: oven was always the highest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it did fluctuate and I think that that
is going to be very well explained in the
[SPEAKER_02]: next several slides when we talk about
decarboxylation and terpene loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end, of course,
all of those methods produce data that is
[SPEAKER_02]: reproducible against itself which
indicates that the laboratory should be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to get consistent results internally
if using any of these methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there shouldn't be this conversation
of, oh, I used loss on drying at high temp
[SPEAKER_02]: and one of my samples was 10% and one of
my samples was 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what we should be seeing if
people are processing these methods
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do this full comparison for an
individual sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are about to go very data heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just bear with me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first up, we have the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I have in this image is a zoomed
in image looking at Delta 9 and THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have an overlay of all of these
methods and I've attempted to color code
[SPEAKER_02]: them so hopefully you can tell the
difference in the colors here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we can see in the table below as
well is we have the OG which is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be our as received.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a sample as it came in,
analyzed it, didn't manipulate it in any
[SPEAKER_02]: manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw that the THCA was 20.5% and the
Delta 9 was about .4%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we ran all of our different
methods and we looked at what those
[SPEAKER_02]: percentages would be of the THCA and the
Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see here that that vacuum
desiccation sample really didn't change
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have 20.3% THCA and about .5%
Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_02]: The loss on drying sample though,
that's a little concerning.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's at pink peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're loss on drying that sample
at a high temperature of 103, we are
[SPEAKER_02]: almost completely decarboxylating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see there that we now only have
about .2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 27% THCA and now we have 17.4% Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loss on drying at low temperature had
minimal degradation and decarboxylation of
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabinoids similar to the vacuum
oven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly enough, Karl Fischer did see
more decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, what we know about Karl Fischer
is that it's only looking at water
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So theoretically, even though this
decarboxylation is occurring, it shouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: be factored into that moisture
calculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is why we're seeing a similar
result between that loss on drying at low
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, the vacuum oven, and the Karl
Fischer because that decarboxylation is
[SPEAKER_02]: not being factored in.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the next several slides, we're going to
review the total percent decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in order to calculate that,
we looked at the actual decarboxylation
[SPEAKER_02]: divided by the theoretical decarboxylation
multiplied by 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that theoretical decarboxylation was
calculated based on what that as received
[SPEAKER_02]: sample would be if it fully
decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see here the vacuum desiccation
sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a chromatogram at what we refer to
as a 1x, so our standard prep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do not be alarmed of how big that THCA
peak is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are definitely not quantifying off of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We run a second dilution.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted you to be able to see the big
picture and also be able to see those
[SPEAKER_02]: minor cannabinoids and how they're
impacted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're looking at is a pretty
similar chromatogram between the as
[SPEAKER_02]: received and the vacuum desiccation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not really seeing much of a change
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are seeing that THCP peak drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit, and the delta 9 peak
increased a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, these chromatograms are very
similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then go to the loss on drying at high
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not looking at a similar
chromatogram.
[SPEAKER_02]: This chromatogram is now very,
very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to having the THCA peak be
almost non-existent and the delta 9 peak
[SPEAKER_02]: being huge, we also have CBN being formed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that delta 9, as it breaks
down, it forms CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also have other decarboxylation
products occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBGA in the sample also decarboxylated
into CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loss on drying at low temperature,
very similar to what we were seeing with
[SPEAKER_02]: the loss on dry or the vacuum desiccation
sample, where we're not seeing too much
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylation, but some.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have those total decarboxylation
percentages on the bottom of each of these
[SPEAKER_02]: slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: The as received versus the vacuum oven,
again, very similar to what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can tell from these methods that
we're seeing limited decarboxylation
[SPEAKER_02]: across those three methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vacuum desiccation, the vacuum
oven, and the loss on drying at low
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to the Carl Fischer, and we see a
little bit more decarboxylation occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one, we saw about 37%
decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not anywhere near what we were seeing
on that loss on drying at high
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, but the sample is being
manipulated in some ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is being a chemical change
occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next, we wanted to look at terpene loss
and wanted to understand what that impact
[SPEAKER_02]: may be on the samples as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we analyzed for terpenes, again,
the very similar procedure where we looked
[SPEAKER_02]: at the original as received terpene
content, and then we measured the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: content after analyzing via each of these
methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we can see here is that we
started out in this sample specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: with about 1.6% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vacuum desiccation sample resulted in
having a remaining terpenes of about 0.87.
[SPEAKER_02]: The loss on drying at high temperature had
absolutely no terpenes left.
[SPEAKER_02]: The loss on drying at low temperature had
about 0.5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vacuum oven about 0.3%, and the Carl
Fischer about 0.5% as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And similar to what we did with the
decarboxylation, we also want to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the percent terpene loss, so how many
terpenes were lost overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that total terpene loss divided by the
total terpenes as received times 100 on
[SPEAKER_02]: each of these next slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the zoomed in chromatogram of
each of these, and we're going to start
[SPEAKER_02]: with the as received versus the vacuum
desiccation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you can see here is the really
big peak that looks the same in each of
[SPEAKER_02]: these is our internal standard,
so that is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rest of these analytes,
we can see that a lot of these terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: are starting to drop and starting to
disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, one important thing to notice is
that the terpenes in front of the internal
[SPEAKER_02]: standard drop off more than the terpenes
behind the internal standard, and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: based on the heaviness of those terpenes
and the volatility of those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the higher the boiling point,
the less they're boiling off in these
[SPEAKER_02]: methods, or the less they're coming off
and volatilizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one, this is at room temperature,
so it's all just volatilizing based on
[SPEAKER_02]: that vacuum being utilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas those lighter ones, we are seeing
quite a bit of degradation still.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then looked at that loss on drying
sample at a high temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's absolutely nothing remaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be a little itty bitty baby
alpha-bizzabolo peak, but definitely below
[SPEAKER_02]: our detection limit for quantifying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those results ended up indicating that
that was zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we looked at the loss on drying at
low temperature compared to that as
[SPEAKER_02]: received, and we saw something similar to
what we saw at the vacuum desiccation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but because we're adding heat,
a lot of those early looting terpenes are
[SPEAKER_02]: almost completely gone, which is what you
would expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're adding heat at 80 degrees in this,
and so those terpenes are saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: bye, we don't stay here anymore,
and no longer in that sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have the vacuum oven sample,
and so this one's heated to 40 degrees and
[SPEAKER_02]: so we did surprisingly see more loss in
this than we did at that loss on drying at
[SPEAKER_02]: low temperature, and I think that this can
be explained by the amount of time that it
[SPEAKER_02]: takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the loss on drying at low temperature,
that sample only takes about 14 to 15
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes to analyze.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this loss on drying because
you're doing, or this vacuum oven sample,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're doing 40 degrees Celsius,
you have to leave it under vacuum for much
[SPEAKER_02]: longer, so those terpenes are being pulled
off of the sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have the Carl Fischer sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, again, it is experiencing that loss
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are heating the sample to 100 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, what we know about Carl Fischer
is that those values are not going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: factored in unless water molecules are
being formed, and I think that's an
[SPEAKER_02]: additional part of this investigation,
right, is what water molecules could be
[SPEAKER_02]: formed in any of these Carl Fischer
extractions, and could that be impacting
[SPEAKER_02]: things?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as kind of a summary of this,
I wanted to paint a picture for
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding the total weight loss via
each of these methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have the moisture obtained by
each method, along with the weight lost by
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylation, the weight lost by
terpenes, and the total weight loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exactly how much, what percentage
of the weight is lost via each of these
[SPEAKER_02]: methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see when you're running that
vacuum desiccation method, you obtain a
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture of about five, close to 5%,
and we're experiencing a total weight loss
[SPEAKER_02]: of about .9%.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then move to that loss on drying at
high temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're getting a moisture of 13%,
but the total weight loss contributed to
[SPEAKER_02]: the decarboxylation in terpenes is over
4%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think about samples where you
have high terpene content and high THC
[SPEAKER_02]: content, that number could be even higher
when we're talking about that total weight
[SPEAKER_02]: loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then have the loss on drying at low
temperature sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got 8.3% as our moisture obtained,
and then we saw about 1.2% loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vacuum oven, we got 7%, and saw about
1.3% loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Carl Fischer, we got 7.72 and
saw about 2% loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So interestingly, the Carl Fischer did
yield the second most amount of loss,
[SPEAKER_02]: yet its results still line up really well
with that loss on drying at low
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature in the vacuum oven,
which further indicates that the Carl
[SPEAKER_02]: Fischer is not factoring in anything but
those water molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are some of the conclusions we
were able to establish from this study?
[SPEAKER_02]: First is going to be that there is
significant decarboxylation and loss of
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes with the loss on drying at high
temperature method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so overall, what we saw an average
across all of the samples that we looked
[SPEAKER_02]: at for cannabinoids, which ended up being
about 30 samples, we saw that the loss on
[SPEAKER_02]: drying had an average decarboxylation of
87% and had an average terpene loss of
[SPEAKER_02]: 93%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is very impactful for
understanding those results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we had the Carl Fischer, and it did
exhibit the next largest amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylation and terpene loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for that sample, we saw 37%
decarboxylation on average, along with 69%
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, those results were not
drastically impacted by that, which lends
[SPEAKER_02]: to the understanding that the Carl Fischer
is a gold standard kind of method when
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at something with a lot of
volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vacuum desiccation samples did
experience the least amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylation and terpene loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on average, the decarboxylation was
only 1.7%, and the terpene loss was about
[SPEAKER_02]: 55%.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there are concerns that those
samples are not being brought to complete
[SPEAKER_02]: dryness because of some of that water may
be very well bound in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're doing some additional
experiments with that, where we're taking
[SPEAKER_02]: the samples, analyzing them using the
vacuum desiccation, and then putting them
[SPEAKER_02]: on the Carl Fischer to see what it
indicates as far as what moisture may be
[SPEAKER_02]: remaining in those samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, that loss on drying at
low temperature for the Carl Fischer and
[SPEAKER_02]: the vacuum oven results are on average
within 1% of one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that this is really impactful
for the cannabis industry, not only
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're limiting the
decarboxylation, we're limiting the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene loss, but it also gives us a way
to make method recommendations for what
[SPEAKER_02]: people should be utilizing in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so ultimately, the final takeaways are
that laboratories should be using
[SPEAKER_02]: something like Carl Fischer, the vacuum
oven, or the loss on drying at low
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature when looking at moisture
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on this study, we are
hypothesizing that most cannabis flower is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually around 7% moisture once it's
finally dried and cured versus the 12% to
[SPEAKER_02]: 15% that most people are obtaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to this, we have also done a
relationship study between water activity
[SPEAKER_02]: and moisture to help understand that and
that correlation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to talk with you all
about that after, if you have any
[SPEAKER_02]: additional questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to share some of that data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I would like to thank a
couple of people, Metrom, being one of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metrom gave us a Carl Fischer to be able
to utilize for this study, which was very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very helpful, as well as Aqualab by ADM.
[SPEAKER_02]: They provided us with a ROS-1,
which is a moisture balance that does low
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, so 80 degrees, and allows us
to analyze nine samples at a time,
[SPEAKER_02]: which really helped us be able to process
all 120 samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I will take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Jenny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it appears the drying technique here
can alter the cannabinoid profile and not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily reflect what the patient's
going to be consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any motion toward moving to sort
of aerosolizing smoke and measuring the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual inhalation products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all of this stuff's gonna get
decarboxylated anyway when someone decides
[SPEAKER_00]: to light up a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like we're, we got a bit of a
struggle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got raw cannabinoid content,
then you get rid of the water content,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you over-dry it, some of the
cannabinoids change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, the patient's
never gonna see any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna see pyrolytic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the difference here is this is
focusing a lot on the moisture techniques
[SPEAKER_02]: that laboratories are utilizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, with this, you know, the growers
and the cultivators are drying their
[SPEAKER_02]: flower in much different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not using any of these techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of the laboratory and how they
are providing data to the producers and
[SPEAKER_02]: growers to know how wet or how dry their
flower is.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about aerosol testing,
that's a whole nother monster that I think
[SPEAKER_02]: still has a lot of kinks to work out
before we see any labs doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully and doing it at a high scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever considered freeze drying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did talk about freeze drying in this
and thinking about how that may impact it.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, for a laboratory, whenever we're
analyzing it, most of them don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: freeze dry capabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we were thinking about this study,
we wanted to really focus on what most
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratories could potentially use,
and then, of course, what that gold
[SPEAKER_02]: standard, the Carl Fischer, is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your presentation.
