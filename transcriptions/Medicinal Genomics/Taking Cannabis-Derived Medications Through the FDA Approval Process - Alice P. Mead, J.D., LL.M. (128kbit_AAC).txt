[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank the organizers for
allowing me to speak to you today about
[SPEAKER_00]: something that even a few years ago many
people would have thought was impossible
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's taking a cannabis derived
product through the FDA approval process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Alice Mead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an attorney by training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with GW Pharmaceuticals and its US
subsidiary Greenwich Biosciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GW was founded in 1998 in England by
Dr. Jeffrey Guy and Brian Whittle hence
[SPEAKER_00]: the GW and they had sort of a perfect
storm and a good way of experience that
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed them even to conceptualize and
embark on what was a pretty audacious
[SPEAKER_00]: project in 1998 which was to develop a
whole range of prescription medications
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from the cannabis plant but
developed in accordance with modern
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory standards for pharmaceutical
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first product Sativex is a whole plant
extract actually it's derived from two
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts one high in THC one high in CBD
and of the primary cannabinoids it's a one
[SPEAKER_00]: to one ratio of THC to CBD but we retain
the other plant components.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delivered as an oral mucosal spray so
absorbed by the mouth and it's now
[SPEAKER_00]: approved in over 25 countries for the
treatment of spasticity in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: sclerosis not yet approved in the US but
we are about to start a US program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our second product is Epidiolex so it's a
purified cannabinoid cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delivered as an oral liquid 100
milligrams migs per mil and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: approved as Jonathan said and June 25th
this year for the treatment of seizures in
[SPEAKER_00]: two particularly devastating types of
childhood onset epilepsies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know for years I heard the mantra
quality safety and efficacy that's what a
[SPEAKER_00]: product has to show to get through the FDA
approval process but it wasn't until we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually did it that I realized what
robust meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one wants to take a complex plant
material any plant through the FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: approval process FDA has given a helpful
guidance to industry and that guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: gives a little bit of leeway in the early
stages of development but by the time you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to late stage research it's pretty
much as strict as for any other new
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription medicine and of course you
have to do big randomized double-blind
[SPEAKER_00]: placebo controlled trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a purified product like Epidiolex
isn't subject to the botanical guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just subject to all of the
requirements for any new chemical entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this will seem familiar to many of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an 11-week cultivation cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow our plants in computer controlled
glass houses so all aspects of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation cycle are standardized and
controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own natural growth medium that
has no heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use bio controls for insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We propagate by clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grow for Epidiolex plants that are
very high in CBD so they they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient so we don't actually need that
much in the way of acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 45 acre glass house in England
that's still a huge glass house but it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be sufficient for research and
commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the various stages of manufacturing are
rigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have specifications all along
the way from the botanical raw material
[SPEAKER_00]: through the botanical drug substance
that's the sticky extract to the finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product the botanical drug product and for
a purified cannabinoid specifications for
[SPEAKER_00]: the active pharmaceutical ingredient or
the crystalline CBD and the finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those specifications have to be agreed
by FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we have to test each batch
and accept it or reject it based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: specifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have multiple in-process controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to validate our analytical methods
to FDA's satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We monitor for more in Sativex we monitor
for more than 13 cannabinoids and we
[SPEAKER_00]: characterize about seven categories of
other plant components.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level of impurities is established by
the International Conference on
[SPEAKER_00]: Harmonization or ICH and FDA has adopted
those guidance documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if an impurity so particularly in a
purified product exceeds daily allowance
[SPEAKER_00]: for under ICH we have to do animal
toxicology studies to cover that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do stability studies these
usually take two to three years to cover
[SPEAKER_00]: the expiration date in both the active
pharmaceutical ingredient and the finished
[SPEAKER_00]: drug product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We of course have a quality management
system and all the stages of manufacture
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be conducted under good
manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: products not for dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the batch of one BR a BRM would be
botanical raw material was almost 180
[SPEAKER_00]: pages long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do extractibles and leachable
studies because cannabinoids tend to stick
[SPEAKER_00]: to containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also tend to pull molecules of
certain types of containers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our manufacturing sites and
processes have to be inspected by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the FDA doesn't just take our word for
it that we do GMP they come out and
[SPEAKER_00]: inspect that usually takes five to seven
business days because they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: really very carefully at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go to our clinical operation
site to look at the data we've collected
[SPEAKER_00]: from our clinical trial sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go to a number of the clinical
trial sites to make sure that they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: following good clinical practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we do get approval it's not that
easy to make a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to make a change to a
significant change to our manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: process the FDA has to come back and
inspect again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to change the dosage form so
say from a liquid to a solid dosage form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we have to file a supplemental new
drug application.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have chemistry and
manufacturing control data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have efficacy and safety data
to show that it's bio equivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing if we want to change it from an
oral liquid to a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to file a supplemental new drug
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So FDA has a long list of animal
toxicology studies that we have to conduct
[SPEAKER_00]: and I won't go through all of them but
just the carcinogenicity studies take
[SPEAKER_00]: about two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tricky thing about toxicology
studies is that you have to be using the
[SPEAKER_00]: same material that is used in your later
stage clinical trials or you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: conduct bridging studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need human safety data.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least 100 patient years which can be
hard to get in a short term clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to collect and compile all of the
side effects from mild to severe whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not related to our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do drug drug interaction
studies which is particularly important
[SPEAKER_00]: for CBD because it interacts with the
super family P for 50 enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do food drug interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do studies and subjects that
have kidney or liver impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do a QT study which is to see
whether the product affects the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've heard probably about phase one
through three phase one starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy human subjects and in smaller
numbers to get evidence of safety and some
[SPEAKER_00]: dose data all the way through to phase
three which are hundreds of patients not
[SPEAKER_00]: subjects to get the dispositive or pivotal
evidence of safety and efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after approval FDA often requires
additional studies to get longer term
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence of safety and efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what drug delivery system or
dosage form should a person use in a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tricky with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as previous speakers have mentioned you
want to keep the patient in that
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic window where they're getting
therapeutic benefit but without undue side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that's kind of tricky is
that with cannabinoids there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: intersubject variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've heard a lot about that in
this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you if you select a delivery system
that causes a rapid rate of rise in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma of THC you may cause CNS effects
central nervous system effects and that
[SPEAKER_00]: can unblind and therefore invalidate your
study cannabinoids don't really dissolve
[SPEAKER_00]: in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to come up with some vehicle
that's appropriate oral products have
[SPEAKER_00]: their own challenges because that can be a
longer and more unpredictable onset of
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes through the first pass
metabolism in the liver to produce other
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites cannabinoids are susceptible
to degradation from heat and light
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the acid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we have to decarboxylate from the
acid to the neutral and that can be a step
[SPEAKER_00]: that's difficult to get exactly the same
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids aren't very bioavailable so
you want to optimize the formulation and
[SPEAKER_00]: then there's the placebo effect patients
who know that the investigational product
[SPEAKER_00]: is a cannabinoid have a huge level of
expectation and that can result in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: large placebo response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the product's efficacy doesn't
succeed exceed its placebo response by a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount you have a failed study.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really by the time you get to phase
three you get one bite at the apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really difficult to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of this has to be done under
schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone who handles the product from
preclinical through phase three has to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a special DEA schedule one research
license called registration and usually a
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one research license from the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two processes don't happen
concurrently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually one goes first and then the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be quite prolonged and then you
really need to be able if you are a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer to cultivate a large quantity
of exactly the same cannabis under exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are using the same material for
your phase three studies your
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialized product and your toxicology
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we've heard DEA has not yet
licensed anyone to cultivate a large
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is kind of a workaround cannabis
preparation in finished form can be
[SPEAKER_00]: imported into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: for clinical trials and for
commercialization because the single
[SPEAKER_00]: Convention on Narcotic Drugs requirement
that a national agency have exclusive
[SPEAKER_00]: control of the stocks doesn't imply apply
to for example imported extracts or
[SPEAKER_00]: imported plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sadovac and Epidiolex have both been
imported into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: for research and recently the University
of California San Diego was allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: import an investigational product from
Tulare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible to do research in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because cannabinoids come from
the cannabis plant and they are active in
[SPEAKER_00]: the central nervous system there has to be
a full assessment of their abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people say CBD is not psychoactive but
I believe we were probably the first ones
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a full battery of abuse liability
studies to kind of tease that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did multiple receptor binding studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did multiple animal abuse liability
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a special human abuse liability
study in healthy recreational drug users.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a human dependence and withdrawal
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected special side effects in our
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course the product would have
to be rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would take all of the data from the
abuse liability studies and include it in
[SPEAKER_00]: our new drug application along with
something called an eight factor analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then FDA would look at all that data and
make a scheduling recommendation to DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then under a recent federal law DEA
has 90 days to issue something called an
[SPEAKER_00]: interim final rule scheduling the product
and the product can be sold under that
[SPEAKER_00]: IFR.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if DEA decides that a treaty requires
scheduling then it will issue a final rule
[SPEAKER_00]: not an interim final rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DEA did so with Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It issued a final rule placing the
substance CBD derived from cannabis having
[SPEAKER_00]: not more than 0.1 percent THC and when
incorporated into an FDA approved product
[SPEAKER_00]: into schedule five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're still not done because it
has to be rescheduled under state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the states have their own version of
the Controlled Substances Act and under
[SPEAKER_00]: those laws cannabis and its derivatives
like CBD are in schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is even in states that have medical
or adult use laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them just never rescheduled
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is even after doing all
the hard work of getting it approved by
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA rescheduled by I mean approved by FDA
rescheduled by DEA it couldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensed in any state until there were
changes to state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those changes have no effect on
existing state laws that allow access for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical or adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just create a new track for a
prescription medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's a big tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think there are a lot of options for
patients to choose under the tent but we
[SPEAKER_00]: think it is important for patients to have
the option of a prescription medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
