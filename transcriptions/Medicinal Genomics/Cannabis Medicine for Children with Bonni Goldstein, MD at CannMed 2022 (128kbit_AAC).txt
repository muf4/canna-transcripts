[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to the Can Med Coffee Talk
Lounge here at Can Med 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with Bonnie Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is our medicine keynote presenter here
at Can Med.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnie, welcome to the Can Med Coffee Talk
Lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to see you in person again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so nice to be back in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long two and a half years and
it's just great to see everybody here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in particular, coming to an event
like Can Med and being here in person,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is it that you're looking to get out
of the M.I.?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, we haven't really had a
huge amount of education over the last two
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half years because we've all been
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm really excited to see my fellow
cannabis scientists and hear what they
[SPEAKER_01]: have to say that they've learned over the
last two years, their latest publications,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the cultivation side is going,
where the medical side is going and just
[SPEAKER_01]: looking really to get more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to that point, are there any
presentations in particular that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to hear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm always excited to hear Dr. Ethan
Rousseau.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like our medical cannabis guru,
and he's doing a talk on the latest in for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and psychiatry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke with him a little earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to that one,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have a full hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a treat for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're participating in the medical
practicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving keynote presentation,
as we mentioned, and you're participating
[SPEAKER_00]: on a panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for everything that
you do for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a bit about what you're going
to be presenting about in your keynote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's about pediatrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm focusing on two conditions that are
very commonly treated now with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly we're seeing great results
and very, very excited because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: ton of new research that just came out in
the last couple of years because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: still new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're finally getting some long
term results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also with autism, I'm going to be
talking about some research that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've published two papers in the last six
months looking at biomarkers collected in
[SPEAKER_01]: the saliva that help document the impact
that medical cannabis is having on
[SPEAKER_01]: children with autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's good that you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epilepsy, that's sort of, I mean,
that's pretty well established,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of using cannabis for epilepsy,
but autism, that's one that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to gain steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great that you have this data now
that's showing the biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really quantify that and really
show that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're finding is that the
biomarker improvements correlate with what
[SPEAKER_01]: the parents are reporting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's no longer anecdotal report.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now have objective data, which,
you know, really we don't have for
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that this actually puts
cannabis on an even playing field with
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals to treat autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me speak a bit about the panel that
you're going to be on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the goals there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think with the panel, I'm going to be
sitting with other clinicians and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to share our collective
experience treating thousands of patients
[SPEAKER_01]: with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting is that we all come
from different parts of the country and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all working in our practices and
we're all finding very similar results for
[SPEAKER_01]: people with dementia, for people with
chronic pain, for people with anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: depression, that cannabis is this
unbelievable and useful tool for doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: to start incorporating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, you can't be a doctor anymore and
ignore the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to understand that this plays a
major role in human health and that by not
[SPEAKER_01]: offering cannabis as an option to
patients, especially to those who are not
[SPEAKER_01]: finding good results with conventional
treatments, you're doing a disservice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and I think it's important too,
that even if physicians aren't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily be recommending it to at least
be knowledgeable enough that if your
[SPEAKER_00]: patient comes to you with questions that
you can answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have a conversation and this
idea of there's not enough research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one could say that, but I just had
to race through a presentation because
[SPEAKER_01]: there is so much research that I wanted to
share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's not a panacea for
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just another tool in the toolbox
that physicians and other healthcare
[SPEAKER_01]: practitioners should be including in their
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one encouraging sign that I noticed
when I was sitting in on the practical
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier is when Eloise was welcoming
everyone, she asked people to raise their
[SPEAKER_00]: hand if this was their first experience
getting medical cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good amount of people raised their
hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're sitting in a room and a
patient asks you about something and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know about it, and then that happens
over and over again, as a scientist,
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors are trained scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should know about this so that we at
least can have a conversation with our
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that's meaningful to them so that
we can help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, not everybody should be taking
cannabis, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to be able to be discriminating
when you have these conversations with
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who might it help?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who might it not help?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you are there to do with your
patients is to help them sort out all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this scientific data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that you mentioned,
too, was all the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that we find, especially
with the prohibitions on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only so much research that can be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it has to be done by these
private companies, much like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canframatics and the study that you had
talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that said, how important is it for
these companies that as they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: new data to come to events like Canva and
share that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, I mean, obviously, they are
privately funded companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are putting up their own money and
they might want to withhold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it is important to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's a statistic that
says that something published in the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific data takes 17 years to trickle
down to the clinician.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So conferences like this are so important
because, one, there's camaraderie and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, we're all learning
about what other people are doing in this
[SPEAKER_01]: very important field of cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Bonnie, I know that you're
busy, as we mentioned, with your many
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibilities here at Canva,
but I appreciate you taking the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
