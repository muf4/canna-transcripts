[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Cynthia Bryant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Chief Business Officer at
Demetrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really happy to be here today to
talk a little bit about what we do and the
[SPEAKER_00]: research that we're performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit different than I think a
lot of the other companies here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not a plant-based grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me tell you first about Demetrix,
and then we'll get into the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at Demetrix, the company was founded by
a gentleman, Jay Keasling.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a UC Berkeley professor who started
several companies in biotechnology that
[SPEAKER_00]: are dedicated to producing rare
ingredients to help promote human health
[SPEAKER_00]: and wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at Demetrix, we provide affordable,
sustainable access to rare plant
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients for healthier lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're specifically focused on rare
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that Demetrix operates is on
these pillars of ensuring that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: high-purity product, so 98% pure or
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produce in a very sustainable fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotechnology uses a lot less resources
than typical agriculture when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about rare ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything we do is science-backed in
terms of the research that we perform as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the technology we develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these three things are what really
drives our innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by innovation, what I'm really
speaking to is the desire to find new
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients to help people and to then
design production processes that can bring
[SPEAKER_00]: those ingredients at high enough volumes
and high enough purity to be available and
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable to those that are in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we just take the cannabis plant,
there's over 100 different cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact of the matter is most of
these cannabinoids are in such small
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities in the plant that it is just
impossible to be able to isolate them at
[SPEAKER_00]: the volumes needed to properly research
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where biotechnology comes in,
because what we can do is we can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: single cannabinoids completely agnostic to
how rare or common they are in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can produce them at high volumes
and high purity so that they can become
[SPEAKER_00]: available for researchers to do research
on these specific isolates and understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what the individual cannabinoids
contribute in terms of beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: properties for many indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, this is a picture of our labs
in Berkeley, California, where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: headquartered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we use fermentation to produce
these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take a microorganism such as yeast,
baker's yeast, commonly used for beer and
[SPEAKER_00]: producing bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we program it and say, we want you now
to make this specific cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We develop a very controlled production
environment in a bioreactor, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy word of saying a fermentation tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grow these yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as these yeast grow and as they are in
an environment that's conducive,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start to produce that cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we purify it from the
fermentation broth and we have our
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefit of this, especially when
we're talking about rare ingredients,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the reduction in water, energy,
and land use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because no matter if we're talking about a
cannabinoid or a fragrance ingredient,
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular plant has to produce an
entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to produce the roots, the leaves,
the stems, sometimes the flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, as well as that specific
ingredient we're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that ingredient in the plant is
very rare, you're creating a lot of added
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass, a lot of energy input,
a lot of water utilization for just that
[SPEAKER_00]: small component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take all of that out because all
we're doing is using a small yeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually over a thousand yeasts can
fit into a trichome on a cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're telling it only to make that
specific rare cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know everybody here is very aware of
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hear about cannabinoids,
a lot of times what people talk about are
[SPEAKER_00]: the CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've been doing with our technology
is we now have over 40 different rare
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that we have been taking
through various research to understand and
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog what they actually do from a human
physiology perspective in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors that they interact with and also
taking them into in vitro and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: in vivo tests to then prove to understand
do they actually manifest into the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific benefits that we hope that they
do based on the indications that we see
[SPEAKER_00]: through the receptor screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm going to do for the rest
of this presentation is talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about one specific cannabinoid out of the
40 that we currently have under research,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's CBG or Cannabidgerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we recently commercialized
Cannabidgerol as Arete G, and with our
[SPEAKER_00]: partner Evonic Industries, which is a
large German ingredient supplier,
[SPEAKER_00]: are now bringing this ingredient to the
market for personal care use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of research out there about
Cannabidgerol in general, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: indications that it's a very strong
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see that it has antimicrobial
effects and strong antioxidant properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of this, then we have to do
further research to understand does that
[SPEAKER_00]: translate into an actual claim,
because a lot of this is done at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk a little bit about
what we've done with the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor or very preliminary screening
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work that Demetrix did was specific
to our Cannabidgerol, Arete G,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 98% pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has zero THC in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our process is completely incapable of
producing THC, has zero terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very clean isolate that we've
taken into this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've seen when we took it
through is initially it was GPCR and ion
[SPEAKER_00]: channel screening, and we saw strong
anti-inflammatory properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also saw that it was a strong
antioxidant, and we saw that it had
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting antimicrobial potential as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next step that we did is we put it
into in vitro skin assays to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: does that actually translate when you
start to go into industry standard
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with it, we took a couple of
other cannabinoids that we have listed on
[SPEAKER_00]: here through specific in vitro tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw is that first of all,
all these cannabinoids are physiologically
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's really important
because there's a lot of anecdotal
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence out there about cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having actually screened through the
entire library of GPCRs in the human body,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 different cannabinoids, I can sit up
here and assure you that they do interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that they interact
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one has its own unique fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not all do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's also another
important fact and discovery that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: made because they're not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that leads us to believe is that
there's a tremendous amount of potential
[SPEAKER_00]: not only as individual cannabinoids,
but to expand research and understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: right combinations of the right
cannabinoids to be able to help people
[SPEAKER_00]: with specific indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just scratching the surface here
in terms of the amount of research that
[SPEAKER_00]: still needs to be done to really harness
the true potential of these ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, this is tip of the iceberg in
terms of what we've done and also where we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these in vitro assays, what we see
is the darker color indicates stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: performance, lighter, less performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here even among these
handful of cannabinoids, we see varying
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I'd like to point out
is that we saw that CBG was a really
[SPEAKER_00]: strong and interesting antioxidant in
basic ORAC DPPH tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we put it into antioxidant in
vitro skin assays, we didn't see that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a very strong performer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is also another
important thing in terms of taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: research to the next levels to really
prove out and to elucidate how it
[SPEAKER_00]: translates into that actual benefit that
people need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, we also went a little bit
deeper in terms of looking at these
[SPEAKER_00]: specific assays and understanding the
anti-inflammatory effect of CBG on skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did here is, I just want to get
it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ran this in vitro assay where we
took normal human dermal fibroblasts and
[SPEAKER_00]: normal human epidermal keratinocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing we did is we ran
cytotoxicity assays to understand what's
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest dose that we could actually
use of cannabigerol as well as some other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids in these tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing that was interesting
is that they are different in their
[SPEAKER_00]: cytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ran these tests several times just
to make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG is less cytotoxic than cannabidiol,
CBD, by quite a significant amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that translated into some
of the charts that I'll show next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we understood the cytotoxicity,
we then were able to determine what the
[SPEAKER_00]: right concentrations would be so that we
wouldn't destroy the cells in these
[SPEAKER_00]: assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through a plate model, put the RETG in
with a stimulated inflammation of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and then understood through a
positive and negative control the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance of the CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one we did was a
PMA-stimulated model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see in here is the percent
inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to inhibit PMA in order to,
I'm sorry, you want to inhibit IL-8 in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to see an anti-inflammatory
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So IL-8 is one of the key cytokines in
terms of inciting inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue bar that you see is actually the
positive control and that's storosporine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a known anti-inflammatory that
works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red bars that you see next to it are
the percent reduction of CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see at the higher
concentration, which is three micromolar,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG was right at the performance basically
of storosporine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a really nice dose response
curve with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the gray bars next to it are actually
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll see there if you look on
the x-axis is that the concentrations are
[SPEAKER_00]: different for CBD versus CBG and that's
just reflective of the cytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cytotoxicity differences between the two
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we found was very interesting is
that we hear a lot about CBD being an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting anti-inflammatory and a lot of
people translate that into skin health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we saw in this industry standard
skin model is that CBD really wasn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: good anti-inflammatory in terms of other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I don't have on here is the other
ones, but CBG I'll just share with you was
[SPEAKER_00]: the most highest performing out of the
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next test we did was PGE2 in PMA
stimulated cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here the positive control that you see
is endomethacin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see here is also a decent,
I would call it, a dose response.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we think is we just hit the upper
limit of the CBG response which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: red bars next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, strong anti-inflammatory
properties were seen in this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD in this model showed absolutely no
response in terms of preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing that we wanted to make
sure is are these products safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did a lot of skin irritancy
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were in vivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that CBG and CBD were
both nonsensitizers to skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also not ocular irritants or in
any way damaging to the eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all that this chart is really
showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was interesting because we had over
100 test subjects and not a single one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them showed any indication of irritation
with CBG which is pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were very happy with those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other thing we did was minimum
inhibitory concentration assays against
[SPEAKER_00]: different microorganisms that are
interesting ones for skin health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one that we did here is for
skin care is C.
[SPEAKER_00]: acnes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of research already on
the efficacy of various cannabinoids on C.
[SPEAKER_00]: acnes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we saw was very similar to that
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we feel that we've got a good
validation on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one that are actually two oral
care targets which we were surprised to
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So S.
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants is a microorganism that is
strongly linked to periodontal disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is also a very difficult microorganism
to control with natural products per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the oral care industry uses chemical
ingredients to help to control S.
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants in toothpaste, mouthwash,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that we now have a potential
natural ingredient that not only showed
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy against this but also was not
broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these cannabinoids are not broad
spectrum in terms of their antimicrobial
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually quite measured and quite
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important because we're
all very aware of antibiotic resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: and also wanting to cultivate a healthy
microbiome not only on our skin but also
[SPEAKER_00]: in our oral cavities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that it was good is that
it was active against P. gingivalis which
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure all of us are familiar with in
terms of oral care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have an ingredient that's
naturally derived and hits two of the key
[SPEAKER_00]: oral care microorganisms that we want to
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: For proper oral care health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we layer on top of this the fact
that CBG was also showed a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory response against IL-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets even more interesting for oral
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's research showing that IL-8
inflammation is a link to chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: periodontal disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do you have to control the
microbiome but you also need to control
[SPEAKER_00]: the inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, really interesting results with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is personal care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here M.
[SPEAKER_00]: furfur was an interesting target that CBG
showed efficacy against.
[SPEAKER_00]: M.
[SPEAKER_00]: furfur is one of the funguses that is
often linked to dandruff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: M.
[SPEAKER_00]: furfur is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what region of the world
you live M.
[SPEAKER_00]: furfur is either more important or less
important in terms of controlling the
[SPEAKER_00]: dandruff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mainly Southeast Asia is where that's
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is also one of the key reasons that
some people suffer from tinea versa color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the skin condition that often
shows up on the backs where people have
[SPEAKER_00]: white patches on their skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be a very difficult condition
to treat and to have yet again a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient that shows efficacy against
this M.
[SPEAKER_00]: furfur fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shows a lot of promise to help people not
only to look good but also to feel better
[SPEAKER_00]: about themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, what we're seeing
specifically with Canavageral or Retege is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it shows a lot of promise for aiding
and being a good bioactive for skin care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only for what I'll call the more
cosmetic concerns in terms of anti-aging
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of anti-aging or a lot of the aging
from our skin is an inflammation response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can control the inflammation we
can slow down the aging process is the
[SPEAKER_00]: theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can also help in some other
conditions that quite frankly probably
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot stronger or greater impact on
how people feel about themselves and their
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of helping with acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also as mentioned tinea versa color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then oral health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress enough how important oral
health is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's linked to not only, you know,
diseases within the mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also now being linked to certain
CNS concerns with things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms potentially going through
the blood brain barrier and through the
organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oral cavity and creating issues with
mental health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be linked to digestive support
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to balance the microbiome in
our oral cavity has wider range benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: than just having a pretty smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned, we are looking at other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 40 that we're taking through
many of these various assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we'll be taking into clinicals
with our partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'd like to just leave you with
is that I'm super excited about where we
[SPEAKER_00]: are today in terms of helping people with
health and wellness as an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has so many interesting
ingredients in it that hold so much
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to really help people in a safe
and an effective way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that as an industry we owe it
to the consumers around the world to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to provide products that we know will
work time and time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understand how they work and why they
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can provide real solutions time
and time again for people that are in need
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are always happy to share more about
the research we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that education is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this industry and that we need to stand
on each other's shoulders so to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we welcome conversation and for people
to reach out to us to learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're doing and our findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also be communicating a lot of
these as we learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look forward to speaking with you all
about what we're doing in further detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, very interesting presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the 40 some odd cannabinoids that
you've isolated, are you able to say how
[SPEAKER_05]: many are identical to those produced by
cannabis sativa as opposed to new chemical
[SPEAKER_05]: entities?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all 100% identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every single cannabinoid we produce can
be found in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just in such small quantities you
can't physically isolate them from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're all natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just wondering if you were able to
look at the acid forms of some of these or
[SPEAKER_04]: are you just producing the neutral forms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I had a hard time hearing you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I was wondering if you were able to
look at the acid forms of some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds or you're only able to produce
the neutral forms?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we can produce both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are looking at both acid and neutral
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say the acids do behave
differently than the neutrals,
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologically speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does neutral mean decarbonyl?
[SPEAKER_02]: Diboxylated?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, just checking.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBG for the clinicals that you did,
do you know what percent concentration or
[SPEAKER_02]: do you have a recommendation for a
percentage of concentration for a product
[SPEAKER_02]: application?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so in skincare specifically,
you usually don't want to go above 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is consumer product skincare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're currently doing clinicals to see
its efficacy at that 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for an OTC or pharmaceutical,
depending on the formulation, you could go
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the clinicals would need to be done to
check the actual efficacy within the
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are the commercial products, are they
topicals?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they something that you would ingest
orally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so right now our partner,
Avonik, is specific to topicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: personal care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are currently working with the FDA
as well as EFSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the proper approvals for ingestible
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the nice talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering that you had very little
reactions, like negative reactions when it
[SPEAKER_01]: was on people's skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have any issues with it clogging
pores or the molecules the right size so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's not going to cause any,
like might reduce some breakouts when I
[SPEAKER_01]: produce them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we did not see any issue with
clogging pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are fairly small molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends also, though,
on the formulation that you put the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabigerol in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cannabigerol itself is a solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to solubilize it in something
to apply it to skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what you solubilize it
in, then maybe you can get into
[SPEAKER_00]: comedogenic issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cannabigerol itself is not
comedogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for your talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the method that you used to
measure IL-8?
[SPEAKER_06]: And PG-2 levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at Eliza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in Eliza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for sharing your work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really enlightening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a question about the 2% that's left
after the 98% CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you've fractionated and taken
out the CBG to look at efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we saw last night with Duddy Mary's
talk, sometimes that really low percentage
[SPEAKER_03]: can be really effective as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key thing to keep in mind is that
we don't use any plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 2% that's left in our product
actually comes from the yeast that's used
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's mainly things like carbohydrates
and proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no terpenes in it or other
cannabinoids except for maybe some CBGA
[SPEAKER_00]: that wasn't fully decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a quick question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the particular focus on IL-8?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not IL-3?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different inflammation
markers within the skin and the skin
[SPEAKER_00]: assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you hit IL-8, then that's kind of
like the key indicator that you are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see an anti-inflammatory response.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's others like IL-6, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the assays for those are not as
robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why we picked IL-8 because
it's a much more robust assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you hit IL-8, then you're pretty
assured that you're going to see an
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory response in skin versus
some of these others where you might get a
[SPEAKER_00]: false positive or a false negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a good speaker.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just trying to clarify in my own
mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're producing CBGA.
[SPEAKER_08]: The yeast are producing CBGA.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you're decarboxylating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good clarification.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yeast also, just like the plant,
produces the acid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of the way that we produce,
we are able to easily purify to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: acid form if that's what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can decarboxylate it into the
neutral form.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if that's the case, why no research on
CBGA?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or have you done research?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done research on CBGA as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just we launched CBG first.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you enlighten us on any of the CBGA
research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBGA was, for skin, it was more active
for hyperpigmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ROS support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the receptors, it focused more
on the pain receptors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a feeling he might ask my question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted him to go first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have a question that was similar to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also wanted to know how,
have you guys done any comparisons with
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG isolate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or have you been able to do those type of
comparisons?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what did you find?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mean like from plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: From a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll use the caveat, as long as it's a
high purity plant isolate.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it.
Thank you.
