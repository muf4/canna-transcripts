[SPEAKER_00]: That's more than half off the full price.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full conference pass gets you access
to all the amazing presentations from the
[SPEAKER_00]: top cannabis science researchers,
access to coffee and lunch stations,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as networking events, the exhibit
hall, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head over to canmedevents.com now to learn
more and get your ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great episode for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thrilled to be able to talk with
Ethan Rousseau.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan has been studying the medicinal
effects of cannabis in the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system for as long as anyone, perhaps with
the exception of Professor Rafael
[SPEAKER_00]: Machulam, who coincidentally is Ethan's
mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has authored several peer-reviewed
articles and book chapters, served as an
[SPEAKER_00]: advisor for cannabis companies and
publications, and spoken at all the top
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis conferences around the globe,
including CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I encourage anyone who's
interested to check out his CanMed 2018
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation about the link between the
cannabinoid system, cannabis, and the gut
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get into that a little bit in our
conversation, but we also cover some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis medicine basics, like what is
the endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for any listeners who are new to
cannabis medicine, this should give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: good foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said that, there's still plenty of
meat on the bone if you're a more advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I play you my conversation with
Ethan, we are proud to have his company,
[SPEAKER_00]: CredoScience, as this week's podcast
sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: CredoScience LLC is an IP development
company dedicated to solutions for better
[SPEAKER_00]: living based on forward-looking research
into the cannabinoid system and related
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic applications for
cannabis-based medicines and wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information, go to credo-science
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any further ado, please
welcome Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I want to say that we're so excited
to have you as a keynote presenter this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching your CanMed 2018
presentation in preparation for the call,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was only 15 minutes, which just
was not enough time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really happy that we've blocked off
a full hour for you this time,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know you have a lot of great
information to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll be a luxury that I'm happy to
exploit, because the topic cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: psychiatry is a really broad one,
and it's been an under-recognized and
[SPEAKER_02]: underutilized area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited to talk with you
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was hoping you'd indulge me,
and we could kind of start with the
[SPEAKER_00]: basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I imagine there are some people
who are new to the podcast, new to CanMed,
[SPEAKER_00]: who maybe are just starting their cannabis
journey and maybe don't have sort of that
[SPEAKER_00]: foundational knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering if you could give us a
brief primer on what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the endocannabinoid system has been
known for about 30 years and been on
[SPEAKER_02]: development during that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it basically is the major homeostatic
regulatory system of our physiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's break that down, because it's a
mouthful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the endocannabinoid system is
what keeps the rest of how we function in
[SPEAKER_02]: balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there is too much activity in a
system, the endocannabinoid system tends
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring it down into the normal level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the other hand, if there is an
underactive system, it increases the gain
[SPEAKER_02]: back into the normal level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how this was discovered was that
about 1990, it was found that there are
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors where THC binds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, but that we have
endogenous cannabinoids, cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: within, that also bind to that receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as it turns out, this is what
regulates neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: It regulates neurotransmitter release for
the various neurotransmitters in the
[SPEAKER_02]: brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also regulates emotion,
movement, pain, whether someone will have
[SPEAKER_02]: a seizure or not, whether they're likely
to vomit or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It regulates digestion and almost every
function of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people are surprised
to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that cannabis has been used for
medicine for a long time and it's only now
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of gaining exposure again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to cannabis, what other
sorts of activities or foods can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulate the body's production of those
endogenous cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are actually a lot of things
and it's a complicated topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one clear one at this point is aerobic
exercise.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to increase the gain of the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been shown that that boosts levels of
anandamide, which is a natural chemical in
[SPEAKER_02]: the body that is very akin in its function
to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of diet, there's no one food that
I could tell people is going to improve
[SPEAKER_02]: their endocannabinoid function.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have wondered about fish
oil and these kinds of things,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that can be very healthful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is no one-to-one relationship
between what you eat and what your
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid function is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were going to suggest the simplest
thing that seems to provide benefit,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be prebiotics and probiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probiotics are going to be familiar to
most people as the natural bacteria that
[SPEAKER_02]: are in yogurt and various fermented foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the prebiotics are generally
vegetative matter that these bacteria like
[SPEAKER_02]: that promote their growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why this is important is because these
bacteria reside in the gut and as it turns
[SPEAKER_02]: out, they are really key to not only our
nutrition, but brain function and various
[SPEAKER_02]: other aspects of our health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a problem in modern life because
the modern American diet in particular
[SPEAKER_02]: tends to be pro-inflammatory and has been
associated with the vast increases in a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of autoimmune diseases,
which were quite rare in the 19th century
[SPEAKER_02]: when people ate quite differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people are cognizant of these
nutritional issues, they really can help
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves out in fighting chronic disease
at the same time that they're increasing
[SPEAKER_02]: their endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this would be, I imagine,
a gross oversimplification, but you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to have that standard American
diet and then just ingest cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: expect to have an improvement,
or can you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very surprising, but it's been
shown that THC actually favors certain gut
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria that are more healthful and is
the reason that chronic cannabis users
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to be lean rather than overweight,
as one might expect due to the well-known
[SPEAKER_02]: munchies effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's true that THC stimulates hunger,
but in fact, it alters the gut bacteria in
[SPEAKER_02]: a way that helps prevent obesity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So supplemental cannabinoids from cannabis
can improve the situation, but not
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone is going to resort to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are, again, these nutritional
approaches with prebiotics and probiotics
[SPEAKER_02]: that can provide, hopefully, the same
measures of protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, does the delivery mechanism
matter when ingesting cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, certainly in this instance,
oral use is going to be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't advocate smoking for medical use,
and vaporization is better, but there are
[SPEAKER_02]: still issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone has a condition for which they
need chronic administration of a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis-based product, then almost always
oral administration or oral mucosal with
[SPEAKER_02]: tinctures is going to be preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could kind of
explain sort of what is the mechanism with
[SPEAKER_00]: how these cannabinoids interact with the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had mentioned receptors before,
but sort of walk us through, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: ingest cannabis, sort of what's going on
in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first, I have to point out how
complicated it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are at least 150 natural
cannabinoids in the plant, and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: quite distinct in their function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the one hand, THC works directly on
cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CB1 receptor, which is predominant in
the brain, and CB2, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: non-psychoactive receptor that's
immunomodulatory, also involved in pain
[SPEAKER_02]: and reduction of inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So different ones work differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD, cannabidiol, actually doesn't bind
directly very well at all to CB1 or CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: On CB1, it does alter the binding of THC
in a way that helps reduce THC-associated
[SPEAKER_02]: side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But CBD acts on a whole bunch of other
mechanisms in the body, primarily to
[SPEAKER_02]: reduce inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, like THC, is anti-emetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reduces nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also associated with anti-anxiety
effects and anti-psychotic effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are contrary to what excesses of THC
will do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are a whole bunch of other
activities with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one would be working directly on
another receptor called the TRIPV1
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor, which is the same place where
capsaicin, the active ingredient in chili
[SPEAKER_02]: peppers, works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But CBD isn't caustic the way capsaicin
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, we could go on and on for
an hour just on that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brings up an interesting point
because there is sort of a debate between
[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare professionals about what's
better, the whole plant medicine or these
[SPEAKER_00]: single compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds from what you were just
describing that getting a combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: different compounds is what really drives
the medicinal effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm a firm believer in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a movement by some companies
towards producing cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: either by bacteria or yeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're never going to have the range
of activities that a whole cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: extract will with its combination of
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a term for this called the
entourage effect that refers to synergies
[SPEAKER_02]: between different components.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can consist of boosting a
positive effect or reducing a negative
[SPEAKER_02]: side effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's extremely unlikely that
any single compound will have the breadth
[SPEAKER_02]: of activity or the safety profile of a
properly constituted cannabis based
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with so many different strains and
cultivars out there, how hard is it to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of zero in on one combination of
cannabinoids, flavonoids, terpenoids that
[SPEAKER_00]: really gets that desired effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm afraid it's really a function of
where somebody lives in certain
[SPEAKER_02]: jurisdictions, mainly on the West Coast,
there's a wide variety of available
[SPEAKER_02]: chemovars or chemical varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may be possible with good labeling
and good knowledge at point of sale for
[SPEAKER_02]: someone to seek out the profile of
cannabinoids and terpenoids that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be optimal to treat their condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: That situation does not obtain most
places, however.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, it's very difficult and
still hindered by the continued
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're severely limited in what industry
can do and also the ability to do research
[SPEAKER_02]: on these kinds of topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to imagine consistency is another
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a conversation recently with a
cannabis safety testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the woman I was speaking with was
talking about how just within the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, different buds from different
areas of the plant can have really
[SPEAKER_00]: different chemical profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to imagine that's another reason
why you probably are advocating more for a
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture based type delivery system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you pointed out is quite true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a different
cannabinoid profile, mainly greater
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts in the top buds, rather than ones
lower down on the plant that might not get
[SPEAKER_02]: as much sun exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way around this is through pooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, if we had a field of
cannabis, you would collect all the
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers and extract them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with cloning, vegetative propagation
and uniform growing conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: best done in a greenhouse, it is
absolutely possible to get extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: extreme levels of consistency over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's precisely how Sativex, the
cannabis-based medicine developed in
[SPEAKER_02]: England, which has regulatory approval in
30 countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly how it was produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a simple process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an expensive process, but it
absolutely has been done and can be done
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to these endogenous
cannabinoids, is there a one-to-one
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between what the body
produces and what the plant produces in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the compounds?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it's always more
complicated than one might hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I've mentioned, anandamide is quite
analogous to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they both are what are called weak
partial agonists at the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a way of saying that they're not
super high potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work through a great deal of subtlety
on this receptor that is so widespread in
[SPEAKER_02]: the brain and body to regulate
neurotransmitter function and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: other functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is another main player,
let's say, among the endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: that's called 2-arachidonal glycerol,
2AG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works in different areas of the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a higher affinity for the receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a simple relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things are chemically distinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are at least subtle differences in
how they act in different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering if you could kind of
share with us what conditions have
[SPEAKER_00]: benefited the most or I should say,
what conditions have had the most research
[SPEAKER_00]: to support cannabis as a medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's actually a short list.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's long been known the benefits of THC
and cannabis-based medicine and treating
[SPEAKER_02]: nausea associated with chemotherapy,
also in AIDS wasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, Sativex, as mentioned,
is approved in 30 countries for spasticity
[SPEAKER_02]: or muscle tightness associated with
multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There also has been a great deal of
evidence of certain cannabis preparations
[SPEAKER_02]: in treating various types of chronic pain,
especially neuropathic nerve-based pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond that, we have a tremendous amount
of anecdotal evidence for a variety of
[SPEAKER_02]: other conditions, but it's not always
borne out in randomized clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we're talking about specifically
cannabidiol, it's an approved drug as
[SPEAKER_02]: Epidiolex through the FDA for treatment of
severe epilepsy syndromes, Lennox-Gastaut
[SPEAKER_02]: and Travet syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a relatively recent event starting
in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, there have been two phase
two clinical trials of pure cannabidiol in
[SPEAKER_02]: high doses to treat schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed to be as effective as
conventional drugs, but with many fewer
[SPEAKER_02]: side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the flip side, what are some
emerging applications for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's wide open.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the exciting areas is treatment of
primary cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, using high doses of
cannabinoids to treat cancer directly much
[SPEAKER_02]: as chemotherapy would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The advantage there is that most
chemotherapy agents are highly toxic in
[SPEAKER_02]: and of themselves, whereas the
cannabinoids are selective in their
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to kill cancer, but are not
damaging to normal cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a distinct difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond that, there's the whole layer of
psychiatry, which is heretofore been a
[SPEAKER_02]: forbidden territory, but really needs
further investigation for the vast kinds
[SPEAKER_02]: of improvements that properly constituted
cannabis-based medicine could provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that because I know that is
going to be the topic of your presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's talk about different
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most interesting areas is
post-traumatic stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some years ago, there was an excellent
study by Matt Hill et al that looked at
[SPEAKER_02]: survivors of the 9-11 tragedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were two groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were people that were in the area in
lower Manhattan to the events there that
[SPEAKER_02]: developed post-traumatic stress,
and then people that were there that did
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They looked at the cerebrospinal fluid
using spinal taps on these people and
[SPEAKER_02]: showed clear differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a deficit of endocannabinoids in
the people that developed PTSD as opposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to those who didn't have post-traumatic
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a demonstration of deficient
endocannabinoid function in people with
[SPEAKER_02]: post-traumatic stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, on severe depression,
people may be aware that when drugs fail,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is still a technique called
electroconvulsive therapy or shock therapy
[SPEAKER_02]: for people with severe depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that does as a side effect is
produces some short-term memory impairment
[SPEAKER_02]: at the same time that there's a rapid
improvement in mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, a long time ago, it occurred to me
that, gee, I wonder if the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system is involved in this effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of years ago in Germany,
in fact, after ECT treatments,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was shown that there were big increases
in the endocannabinoid levels as opposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to before treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a certain demonstration of the
importance of cannabinoids in depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, anxiety is definitely
associated with endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: As already mentioned in schizophrenia,
although it's true that too much THC at a
[SPEAKER_02]: young age in a predisposed individual
could unmask psychosis, cause psychotic
[SPEAKER_02]: break.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact though, cannabidiol is an
effective treatment for schizophrenia
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are just a few examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some very interesting examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never heard that factoid about the
folks at 9-11 kind of having a very
[SPEAKER_00]: different response with PTSD and it being
tied back to endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It supplements a whole bunch of animal
work, which sometimes is illuminating and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes it's not, but this is clearly a
study done in humans very much on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you brought up
endocannabinoid deficiency because when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was gathering my research for this
conversation and reading about the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, I immediately went
there and thought that if this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that the body is producing,
there must be some people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure enough, I Googled it and whose name
comes up, but Ethan Rousseau, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: did obviously a lot of research into this
going back many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious, what causes this deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it because of diet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it behavior?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it genetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it a combination of all those
things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is all of the above.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a theory I developed about 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was published first in 2001,
more extensively in 2004 than with a
[SPEAKER_02]: follow-up paper in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea was that we know that many
neurologic conditions especially are due
[SPEAKER_02]: to neurotransmitter deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hypothesized, well, why wouldn't there
be conditions in which there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency of endocannabinoid function?
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, what would it look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain things came to mind and these
would be conditions where there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: hypersensitivity to life if you were,
where there's pain, where we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: identify anything wrong with the tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: There seems to be an overreaction and you
can't provide another explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three conditions that most readily
came to mind were migraine, irritable
[SPEAKER_02]: bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting is that these tend to
occur in the same individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: A person may have one, two, or all three
of these conditions at some point in their
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all what are called diagnoses of
exclusion, meaning that we don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: blood tests or diagnostic tests for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you fit a clinical pattern and
we've ruled out everything else,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what you call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have a hypersensitivity of this
sense is producing pain, but in the case
[SPEAKER_02]: of migraine, also sensitivity of the eyes
to light and the ears to sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are painful stimuli, whereas to
someone else is just a normal background.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a great deal of overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to what you asked, how does
this happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are certain genetic
tendencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not genetically inherited the way
eye color is, however.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also could be acquired.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people with irritable bowel
syndrome will develop the condition after
[SPEAKER_02]: they have either had antibiotics or have
had some kind of infection like eating bad
[SPEAKER_02]: clams and can go on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: With fibromyalgia, it often follows an
injury that fails to heal and develops
[SPEAKER_02]: into a more encompassing generalized pain
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there seems to be inciting events and
certainly diet enters into it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, with prebiotic and
probiotic diet, almost all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions will improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on the degree to which
one adheres to that and gauges and other
[SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle approaches that seem to benefit
the conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is there a test one can get to see if
they're deficient in endocannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not currently, but we're working on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lovely thing would be if we had
a non-invasive scan of the brain that
[SPEAKER_02]: would show us the density of the receptors
and their current level of activities,
[SPEAKER_02]: or we could measure endocannabinoid levels
without doing a lumbar puncture,
[SPEAKER_02]: a spinal tap.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, no, and there could be
genetic tests that would identify these
[SPEAKER_02]: issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working on one such situation now to
see, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and another thing that a lot of
people talk about with using cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the effects can vary widely between
different individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that have to do with deficiencies or
different levels of endocannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we're invoking this hypothetical
endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how an individual will respond to a
given dose of cannabis will depend on
[SPEAKER_02]: their prior experience, whether they have
tolerance, if they've been a regular user.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be a function of the numbers
of CB1 receptors in the brain,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether they're active or inactive,
the levels of endocannabinoids in the
[SPEAKER_02]: brain, and also the activity of the
enzymes that make those substances and
[SPEAKER_02]: break them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty complicated concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we have either direct or
indirect proof of a lot of these concepts,
[SPEAKER_02]: but right now, it's not a simple thing
where someone can go out and get tested to
[SPEAKER_02]: see what their levels are.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the future, yeah, we'd hope for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one of the things you keep coming
back to, and it sticks out in my mind
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm a very active person,
I'm a runner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep talking about how activity can
sort of help modulate the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could talk a little
bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, this is a very topical
issue right now because, for instance,
[SPEAKER_02]: where I live, suddenly, the gym is closed
and the parks are closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally, we take the dogs out for a run
every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition to the depression that
people are having because of COVID-19,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to become chemically
depressed without their aerobic activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're not experiencing that,
but everyone's going to be at risk for
[SPEAKER_02]: this, for shut in for long periods of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that would be one example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is a situation where we have
some human data showing the relationship
[SPEAKER_02]: of aerobic exercise to increased
endocannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one such study in fibromyalgia
just recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Years ago, when I was in neurology
practice, I made the statement,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I hold to today, that in
fibromyalgia, I've never seen anyone who
[SPEAKER_02]: improved without the addition of a low
impact aerobic activity program to their
[SPEAKER_02]: regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the reason is improvement in
endocannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're coming up to the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did want to ask you, you've been
researching cannabis medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: applying cannabis medicine for so long
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: How have attitudes among other health care
providers sort of changed over the years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's been improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting better acceptance at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem remains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we still have vast prohibitions active
throughout a lot of the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: including this country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until or unless those roadblocks to
research and wider availability of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis-based medicines occurs,
we're going to have a situation where
[SPEAKER_02]: there are a lot of people out there that
would benefit from these types of
[SPEAKER_02]: treatments that just don't have access at
this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no matter how much things have changed
or improved, there's vast potential for
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have any patients out there that
want to maybe help educate their health
[SPEAKER_00]: care providers, are there some resources
that are good to point them towards?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of good things online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might point to the International
Association for Cannabinoid Medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cannabis-med.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: A variety of my papers are available
online now at ethanruso.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, there's a lot of good
information available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you just plugged your website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other ways people can get in
touch with you or hear more about what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope that we'll be able to do the
CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And additionally, there are a large number
of recordings online.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone just goes to YouTube and inputs
ethanruso and cannabis, they'll find
[SPEAKER_02]: plenty of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will definitely put the links to
your prior CanMed appearances in the show
[SPEAKER_00]: notes here and provide a link to your
website as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we're very hopeful that CanMed
2020 is going to go off without a hitch
[SPEAKER_00]: this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're monitoring the situation closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as it stands right now, we're going to
be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're excited to have you there as
well, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again for taking the time to
talk with us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't see you before then,
we'll see you in Pasadena this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed my conversation with
Ethan Russo.

2018 presentation in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to check out our next episode,
where I will talk with Martin Lee from
[SPEAKER_00]: Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin and his wife Tiffany DeVitt
recently wrote an article titled Cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, and COVID-19 that explores what
science says about CBD as an antiviral
[SPEAKER_00]: agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out that article at
projectcbd.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will find it a well-researched
article that presents some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: data while not making any grandiose
claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode will drop April 29th,
two weeks from this episode.
