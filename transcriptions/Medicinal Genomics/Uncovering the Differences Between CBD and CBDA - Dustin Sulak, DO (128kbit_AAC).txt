[SPEAKER_00]: In that scenario, do they have similar
kind of therapeutic or similar effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that in some cases,
the neutral versus the acid, they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have opposite effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the targets of CBD and CBDA are
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, if you look at THC versus
THCA and compare their pharmacology in the
[SPEAKER_01]: body, very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people take them, they feel very
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD versus CBDA is much more similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so probably one of the targets that's
going to be most important for people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are using this is the activity of the
serotonin receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they both can kind of reduce anxiety
and improve mood via that serotonin
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a number of animal studies
looking at the two, sometimes not in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same study, but two different studies that
have used the same model to evaluate CBDA
[SPEAKER_01]: versus CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see that they can do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both can reduce seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both can decrease inflammatory pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both can decrease nausea and
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of overlap there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanistically, it's usually the same
targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way in which they're achieving these
outcomes is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the dosing is often vastly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: With CBDA, they're requiring a much lower
dose, suggesting it has, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we know from the animal studies is
that it has both better bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take a dose, more of it's getting into
the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it also has more potency once
it's in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look at brain levels or
blood levels of these compounds that are
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary to achieve their result,
you need much less of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more gets in and you need much less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one of the downsides is that CBD
seems to last longer in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDA, you'll excrete more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might therefore have to take it more
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of overlap there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of one of the nuggets that I
picked up watching your presentation from
[SPEAKER_00]: last year was you showed some graphs
showing that CBDA is actually better
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed when it's part of a full plant
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's findings in rodents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we haven't proven that for
humans yet, but based on what we're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: when people say, you know, we're taking
these low doses and they're working really
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is a human study that
showed CBDA absorption through the gut was
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't test it like it did in the
rodent study on its own versus in the
[SPEAKER_01]: context of a whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the information we have is
pointing to what you said that
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially, if there's a little bit of
THC or CBG present with the CBDA,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might absorb it or at least a rodent
might absorb like 15 times more of it with
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit of THC or CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of us would have planned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a lot of us would have said
there is a pretty good chance that for one
[SPEAKER_01]: reason or another, taking this thing in
the context of the whole plant is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be taking the isolated compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's just a lesson we've
learned again and again and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be exceptions to that
lesson, you know, in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically that is the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once in a while, we know why that's
the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those scenarios where we
think we know why that's the case.
