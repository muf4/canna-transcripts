[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of how attitudes from the major
sports organizations have changed when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have any thoughts of kind of
what was the tipping point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do have a lot of thoughts on a lot
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so that, you know, by them
saying that we don't have enough evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: to change our policies, that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they stuck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NFL did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually the players that were
pressuring them saying, OK, fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you keep saying you don't have enough
evidence to change our policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the data then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like figure out how to get the data
because you can't just keep saying you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's kind of sometimes people
will say that as it's like an excuse to
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep bad policies in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as people saying there's no
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tons of research that is already
in the published literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just look like that, it's it's
excuses or these talking points,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, to just kind of leave things status
quo because it is a very disruptive space
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's very misunderstood because we
have that commercial industry to write a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the NFL, it was the players that kind
of pressured them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, why are we so many years later
and we don't have the data?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the most complicated
things with cannabis and getting that data
[SPEAKER_00]: is the funding, because really clinical
trials are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the people that are going to fund
clinical trials would be the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately somehow would have some benefit
from seeing the results, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: One way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the NFL truly does want the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do with it is up to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just you know, we are just here to
get the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be really interesting to see
what they do with the data, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you still have other people that
don't want we need more data, we need more
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that ultimately, right now,
because of the shift in the laws of our
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, the society is shifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the policies that they have in pro
sports, and even I mean, the NCAA just
[SPEAKER_00]: removed cannabis from their prohibited
list, because those policies no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: align with society, like society is
changing their laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to have fluidity amongst
the game, and the place of the game in
[SPEAKER_00]: society, the dysfunction, it was starting
to become too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that was one of the reasons
why they were, you know, they got
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in, okay, well, let's see,
maybe we can put up some funding and find
[SPEAKER_00]: people to get the data then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, it's the amount of
money, you know, and yeah, and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of drug design for sure being done
with cannabinoid molecules, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: scaffolding of how they work, well,
it will, I mean, we have data already to
[SPEAKER_00]: show in animal models that there there is
a ton of effect there in
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration,
you know, we know that they are active
[SPEAKER_00]: there, those molecules are active there,
we know that we now drug design has some
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated things like, you know,
bioavailability, you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducible dose, you have to have
reproducible, you know, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid system itself is very
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at funding the clinical
trial, it's who would put money into that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because with a product that's available to
everybody right now with no prescription
[SPEAKER_00]: needed, and it will continue to be like
that industry is not going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whose benefit is it to put the money up
to do the research, and even in the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial industry, they don't actually
need any data whatsoever to shelf a
[SPEAKER_00]: product, they don't need to show
pharmacokinetic data, they don't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: show bioavailability, they don't need to
show anything, they can package a product
[SPEAKER_00]: and sell it as long as they're following
the food and drug compliance, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: an FDA approved thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, there's no incentive for them to
fund it because they actually don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: it, they can make an edible product and
just put it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's tricky to find anybody that it
would even would be interested in doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the NFL like I applaud them really
for doing it, because it shows that their
[SPEAKER_00]: minds are at least progressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not, you know, for a long
time, the conversation about cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine just had the brakes on,
like nobody wanted to talk about it or try
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand it, you know, and it's no
different than any pharmacological agent,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is bioactive, and it should be treated
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that in society, we've chosen to
make it available to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a different conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a plant and perhaps should never
have been prohibited in the first place,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So why we are in this place right now is a
different conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, how do we get out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I applaud the NFL for wanting to
actually see the data and putting up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the call for research,
because it is not an easy space to get
[SPEAKER_00]: funding for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
