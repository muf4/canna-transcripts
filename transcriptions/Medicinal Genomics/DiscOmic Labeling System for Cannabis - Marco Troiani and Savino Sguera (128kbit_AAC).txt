[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a quick warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was originally intended to be a
little longer, so we had to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our strategy is we're going to move
through it very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any parts we skipped over too quickly,
please ask us questions at the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: God willing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I've been up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my partner, Savino, here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what he's been up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the main idea we're going to
go over.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 958 unique flower samples of
cannabis that we analyzed for 20 terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: with chemical analysis, GCMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main idea is we took these 20
variables times about 1,000 strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: used computer-assisted algorithms to
reduce it down to six variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, we used those six variables
for two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, we mapped it to possible enzyme
pathways that explain the theory of
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesis of terpenes in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, we used them to create the dyscomic
labeling system of which this presentation
[SPEAKER_01]: is named after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And additionally, hope for the future is
that this reduced six-variable group that
[SPEAKER_01]: can describe the terpene profile can
assist medical doctors in recommending or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even one day prescribing cannabis
strains to patients based on their
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why are we focusing on terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a real quick overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some data up on the wall here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each little box of the four boxes is a
different strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see replicate analysis from
different cuts of that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD shows up in blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, all you're really going
to see is THC, green.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at the next four.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's CBG, the precursor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bud was plucked early.
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, same story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just seeing THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last three, same thing, THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at the global average in our
958 sample data set, 18% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even though some strains are like half
CBD, the average comes to less than 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's focus on terpenes instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see instead with terpenes, huge
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do the strains agree with each
other, meaning when you test the same
[SPEAKER_01]: strain twice, you get a very similar
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also see diversity from one strain to
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to confuse these profiles
with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the replicate tests show
distinct replicate profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one up here, Juicy Fruit,
is a great example of how when you test
[SPEAKER_01]: the same strain, you're going to get very
similar profile ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, this goes on forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, what this opens the door for is
fingerprinting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpene profiles are really unique between
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of strain fraud and
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dream is selling great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll grow whatever I have and call it Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how's the budtender going to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: With a terpene-based system, you can see a
match based on actual chemical science and
[SPEAKER_01]: say this was actually the same strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the methodology has got three phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase one is chemistry, chemical analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we know what terpenes are and what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase two is computer-assisted algorithms
and data analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase three is putting it all together,
making the enzyme pathways work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase one, or stage one of methodology,
is just chemical analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you familiar with chemical
analysis, it's a chromatography,
[SPEAKER_01]: GCMS, headspace sampler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gas phase sampler.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just basically evaporating the
terpenes off the cannabis sample and
[SPEAKER_01]: separating them and quantifying them with
a mass spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to really reduce the data because
there's a lot of not-so-defensible data
[SPEAKER_01]: out there in the cannabis market,
and that would have thrown off our phase
[SPEAKER_01]: two, our computer-assisted algorithms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to really limit it to just a
couple labs that we had to audit very
[SPEAKER_01]: closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total data set was 958 at the bottom of
the screen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're familiar with terpenes and
cannabis, I'm sure you're familiar with
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these 20 at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a little bit about our methodology
here, we have four techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: LC, UV, LCMS, GC liquid injection,
and GC headspace.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have advantages and
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chose the one all the way at the end,
the GC headspace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Main reasons being it's a very clean
loading with low interference,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you get good, accurate data.
[SPEAKER_01]: GCMS liquid injection, which I know some
other researchers are very fond of,
[SPEAKER_01]: has some maintenance and analyte breakdown
issues, but otherwise is very comparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LC I would honestly stay away from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what a chromatogram looks like
for those of you familiar with chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see the numbers here, 1 through 36,
are the different terpenes that were
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated from a cannabis sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll pass it to my partner for stage
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been an exponential increase in
the amount of data associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis chemical profiles and genetic
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, a lot of traditional,
as we've seen today, a lot of traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: chemometric and metabolomic methods have
been applied, including PCA, LDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: linear regression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we want to do is take these and
put them into a form that could be better
[SPEAKER_00]: understood and absorbed by the general
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some previous studies have found that
strain name, there's no significant
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profile clustering around strain
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strain name is not a very good
predictor of what the final terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as well, last year we found that the
strains can be subdivided into overlapping
[SPEAKER_00]: groups, as we've also seen here,
based on dominant terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we wanted to do is, instead of basing
it on the dominant terpene, we base it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the ratio of several dominant terpenes to
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started with self-organizing maps,
which used basically a bunch of iterations
[SPEAKER_00]: of principal component analysis to group
the samples into a higher dimensional
[SPEAKER_00]: space, use this to see which ones are
appear to be related to each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: and test it out with some k-means
clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that to translate into our label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you a quick overview,
this is a self-organizing map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red indicates high concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light whitish blue indicates low
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, high CBDA strains and high
THCA strains are on opposite sides because
[SPEAKER_00]: they occur in different places in the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're organized by their chemical
profile, and the profiles are in separate
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of crossover in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, they exist on
different sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different genes that code for each
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and so now we're on to the
third stage of the methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we have the chemical data,
once we let the computers play with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got to map this together and explain
how these terpenes are being made by
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So step one is we needed peer-reviewed
literature on enzymes, terpene synthases,
[SPEAKER_01]: in higher plants, just to get us in the
ballpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is just a screenshot from a
database we've built.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, there's these columns.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle, output one, output two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them just make one terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them make a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them make them in fixed ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part of the complexity of
mapping this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and so the idea is to filter
through all of those entries and match
[SPEAKER_01]: them to the data that we're getting from
the computer-assisted algorithms and
[SPEAKER_01]: generate a map that would look something
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more hypothetical, but a more
defensible map that we can link directly
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we've overviewed the
methodology, let's actually go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stage one was chemical analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have 958 samples times 20 terpenes,
which is 20,000 data points.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started with a standard approach,
statistics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do averages, standard deviations,
global maxima, and see what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did get 11 terpenes that are at
significantly higher levels than the
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listed them here at the bottom,
but it's more fun to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue is the mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue plus red is mean plus standard
deviation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue plus red plus yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We threw the global maximum on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you tally them up,
you can see that statistically,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's 11 players that are gonna kind of
tower over the others in these profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think, okay, we got our 11 that
we're gonna look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some issues with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focusing on high-concentration terpenes is
a problematic approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are not known to have the same
medical effect on the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because the milligram of lanolawal
does something doesn't mean that the
[SPEAKER_01]: active dose for another terpene couldn't
be much higher or much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at the absolute concentration
doesn't really give us a good idea of why
[SPEAKER_01]: things are medically efficacious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, there's been a lot of
reports that terpenes have very complex
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolic pathways and very complex
medical effects on the body and that small
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations of other terpenes can
affect the way our body's processing the
[SPEAKER_01]: higher-concentration terpenes,
what some people call the entourage effect
[SPEAKER_01]: or synergistic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: This means we need to go past statistical
analysis and do something a little fancier
[SPEAKER_01]: so we can look at the complexity of this
20-variable data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we turn to the
self-organizing maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the results of the terpenes
running the self-organizing maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the alpha-pinene,
beta-pinene occur most often together,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as karyophylline, humuline,
and nerolidol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, we see limonene and lanolawal
occurring in a very tight correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: together and the terpenes occurring
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, they don't occur in the
same space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mercyne and osmine occurred in different
spaces, but there is some overlap and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll go over that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the normalized data plotted
plane and all we see is some of the points
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to cluster around axes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we've run it into k-means clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, this is the
limonene-lanolawal group versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes group.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is three major clusters that
separate very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indicates three different genetic
variants that are producing different
[SPEAKER_00]: relative amounts of these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we see this when comparing the
pinenes to the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the Mercyne-osmine,
so there's a group that produces Mercyne
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a group that produces Mercyne and
osmine together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the sesquiterpenes, karyophylline,
humuline, occur in a very tight
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation with about a one to three
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The others, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for this to work, there have to
be valid methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The methods have to match very tightly
there at the proficiency rounds and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that all the data can be aggregated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we want a diverse data set genetic
geographically as well as environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: growing conditions, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we've looked at the patterns we
saw from the computer-assisted algorithm
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis, let's look at how we can make
sense of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick review.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a theory where there's two
compounds coming from one enzyme with one
[SPEAKER_01]: precursor, we expect to see positive
correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that precursor, one at the top,
as that concentration increases,
[SPEAKER_01]: the concentration of the two compounds at
the bottom is going to increase to a fixed
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio, so we see positive correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we see two compounds that have a
common precursor but have two enzymes,
[SPEAKER_01]: we will see a competitive situation where
their sum is relatively constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the amount of the precursors competed
by the two substrates, we see a negative
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation in the concentration of those
two compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using these principles, we looked at
Crouteau's 1987 paper to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do other plants that are more well
studied than what we're looking at,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, make their terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to map out a cannabis map from
the materials in the Crouteau paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we got something that looked like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can see the colors don't seem to
correlate in these competitive groups like
[SPEAKER_01]: they should have a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the genetic variation from one
plant to the next, causing some
[SPEAKER_01]: difficulty.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we zero in on the different axes that
my partner was talking about before,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was talking about osmine-mercine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mercine can appear alone, osmine can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two real groups, one with both and
one with only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way to explain this is two
enzymes, one that produces just mercine,
[SPEAKER_01]: and one that produces mercine and osmine
in a fixed ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming that they are of the same gene
and they are shuffled alleles,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to see homozygous and
heterozygous plants of different
[SPEAKER_01]: combinations of this, giving us three
ratios, which is what we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mercine only, one ratio of mercine-osmine,
which was lighter, and then a heavier
[SPEAKER_01]: osmine-favoring ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, they get much more
complicated than that when you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene families.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpene family had four.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at three terpenenes,
alpha, delta, and gamma, and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at caring.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to have the common precursor
that moves their concentration together,
[SPEAKER_01]: which here we labeled as two, but we're
hypothesizing to be a terpenyl
[SPEAKER_01]: pyrophosphate, or some sort of terpenyl
cation.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other side, from the common
precursor, we see that an enzyme moves the
[SPEAKER_01]: other way towards precursor three,
which we're hypothesizing is
[SPEAKER_01]: lanolipyrophosphate, because it's known to
be a precursor to both limonium and
[SPEAKER_01]: lanolibol, which co-occur in our data set
very tightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, using literature in other higher
plants, other than cannabis, we're
[SPEAKER_01]: hypothesizing that the common precursor
they're competing over is geraniol
[SPEAKER_01]: pyrophosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as for the last group, orange versus
green, it's more difficult because the
[SPEAKER_01]: pynenes don't show a very clear
correlation with any other group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We at first thought this was anomalous,
but when we started looking through that
[SPEAKER_01]: literature database, we saw that pynene is
synthesized a very large number of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a countless number of ways to get
to that product, and in other plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a great diversity of those enzymes
that can get you to that same product,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's not easy to draw these linear
correlations like we were doing earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: with a positive and negative correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversely, on the orange side,
we see enzyme four creating karyophylline
[SPEAKER_01]: and humuline, which we hypothesize uses
the precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we think this agrees with our data
set, showing a positive correlation in a
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed three-to-one ratio between
karyophylline and humuline across the data
[SPEAKER_01]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this comes to the labeling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal was to create a label that would
be simple and intuitive for the average
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would provide a standard approach to
product categorization and selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take something that has been
qualitative, the choosing of strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually by smell and taste, and turn it
into something more quantitative and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-subjective, like we would see with a
nutrition label or with a chemical hazard
[SPEAKER_00]: label, something easy to recognize but
also quantitatively based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the label, and here's sort of
how it's set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the thickness of each radius in
a ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That corresponds to the normalized
concentration of that subgroup,
[SPEAKER_00]: the groups that we talked about before,
which are split out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the rings can be either solid or
split, depending on which of the clusters
[SPEAKER_00]: it falls into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they are split, then the ratio of
each color corresponds to the ratio of
[SPEAKER_00]: those two groups with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does this translate into?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we run the actual numbers through
this system, what we get are these
[SPEAKER_00]: color-coded labels that are very
indicative of the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, you can match strains
using these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the Gorilla Glue has
almost identical labels, whereas the KC
[SPEAKER_00]: Jones and Cherry Diesel are very,
very close to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if one were to run out of KC Jones and
want another strain that was very similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, they could go for that Cherry
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are sort of the 27 major groups,
since each of the concentric rings has
[SPEAKER_00]: three possible formats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the 27 possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here are a histogram of how many
samples in our database were in each of
[SPEAKER_00]: the groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, there are some groups
where most of the data falls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some that weren't represented
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could mean either these are areas
where breeding needs to happen or areas
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's impossible because of the
underlying genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that concludes what's actually been
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about where we want this to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left here, you see the 958.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the database we've been talking
about this whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right is a small medical paper
database of stuff not behind a paywall
[SPEAKER_01]: that studies either a cannabinoid or a
terpene and its effect or efficacy on a
[SPEAKER_01]: known human disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is, with this labeling
system, we're hoping to facilitate doctor
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations and possibly prescriptions
of specific cannabis strains with specific
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical content to specific disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that's the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of all this is not the chemistry,
but the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a screenshot of what this
database looks like right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have about 500 papers in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they can't be behind paywalls and
they study cannabis, so slim pickings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we see on the left all the publication
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the right, you see those green
check marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tracking chemical compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the far right, you're seeing
cannabinoids, THC, CBD, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle, we see which disorders
being looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And further to the left, we're looking at
what terpenes the study might have looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a lot of these studies didn't look at
cannabis because the history is not easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to do clinical trials on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of this is essential oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this is other compounds that
contain these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we output these 501,
we get a very slim, slim pickings output
[SPEAKER_01]: chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea here is that you see the
terpenes in the first column and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: disorders across the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number represents the number of
peer-reviewed papers from our database
[SPEAKER_01]: that indicate a positive effect for that
compound on that disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right now, we're in the double
digits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to go up orders of magnitude
before this becomes an actual usable
[SPEAKER_01]: resource or could even possibly be one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea is to connect it to the
dysgamic system to make better
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is another form of output
where we basically listed each
[SPEAKER_01]: peer-reviewed paper in a list going down
the left and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to the right, we have columns
basically populated when a terpene is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the compounds of interest studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we eliminated the cannabinoids
for this purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also programmed it to be
color-coded to the dominant terpene group
[SPEAKER_01]: from our label system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a resource like this with many
thousands or hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: papers maybe, would be a much better
resource for medical doctors to look
[SPEAKER_01]: quantitatively at what's actually in the
strain and how that is statistically
[SPEAKER_01]: proven to be effective against a variety
of disorders in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that pretty much sums us up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Special thanks to DB Labs and MCR Labs and
Leaf Therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Round of applause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
