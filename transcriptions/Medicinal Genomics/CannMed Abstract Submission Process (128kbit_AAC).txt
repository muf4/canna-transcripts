[SPEAKER_00]: The CanMed podium is reserved for
presenters who have performed novel
[SPEAKER_00]: research in cannabis science, medicine,
cultivation, or safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All potential presenters must submit an
informative abstract that summarizes their
[SPEAKER_00]: research, including the study's objective,
methods, results, and conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our CanMed advisory committee,
made of industry leaders in the four focus
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, reviews each of the submissions for
relevance, quality of data, and potential
[SPEAKER_00]: to inspire discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their feedback on the submitted abstracts
and their recommendations help shape the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall content of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of the conference is to
provide the CanMed community with the
[SPEAKER_00]: latest, most relevant data in the four
fields represented at the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our abstract approval process eliminates
the marketplace atmosphere and business
[SPEAKER_00]: interests from influencing presentations,
providing a pure podium that is free from
[SPEAKER_00]: self-promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What types of abstracts are typically
accepted at CanMed events?
[SPEAKER_00]: Data-driven abstracts that cover novel
areas of research, thought-provoking
[SPEAKER_00]: abstracts that will inspire discussion,
abstracts that are relevant to at least
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the CanMed 2020 focus areas,
cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Submit your abstract at canmedevents.com
