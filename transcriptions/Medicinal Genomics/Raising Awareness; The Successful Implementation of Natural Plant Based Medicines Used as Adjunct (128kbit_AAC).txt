[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jaime Brambila.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the co-founder of Grace Health and
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other co-founder is my wife Nicole,
and she is the subject of the case study
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to be presenting today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my wife Nicole is right here joining
us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the title of the case study
presentation that I'm making is metastatic
[SPEAKER_00]: breast cancer and remission following
standard cancer treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: An agenda of medical cannabis and
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in August of 2018, Nicole was diagnosed
with stage four de novo metastatic breast
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, which was an ER positive,
PR negative, HR2 positive, BRCA negative,
[SPEAKER_00]: ductal carcinoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mouthful right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it included metastasis of the bone,
liver, and lymph nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first spoke to her oncologist at
the clinic at Memorial Sloan Kettering,
[SPEAKER_00]: her prognosis was less than favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They explained that she had to go through
many rounds of chemo, radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and perhaps, well, not perhaps,
a life that would be filled with therapy
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of her life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see the scans, the PET CT
scans of what she was initially diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can see my cursor
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see the slide on the left-hand
side, that's the initial mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there, that's the breast mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the left-hand side,
we see that these are metastases of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pelvic area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is when she was first diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She took standard therapies in combination
with the cannabis and psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the chemo and targeted therapy
regimen that she underwent was a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of Taxotere, Progedin,
and Herceptin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the oncology world, they called
this, well, they studied this through the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleopatra study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we know from that study is that
37% of patients are alive at eight years
of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a patient becomes metastatic,
their life span is dramatically decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some statistics show that at best,
in the best case scenario, patients get to
[SPEAKER_00]: live up to 10 years if the treatments are
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a life of constantly changing
treatment because the cancer becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to the therapies, and so
oncologists have to constantly switch the
[SPEAKER_00]: therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only 16% of patients with this
diagnosis and with this type of protocol
[SPEAKER_00]: experience no evidence of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very important because patients
that do experience no evidence of disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an indicator of how prolonged their
lifespan can be afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to this, we did do a ketogenic
diet because we had the understanding that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are lipid molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we optimize the lipid
metabolism, there's a better chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also included supplements, borage oil,
omega oils, all precursors for
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I want to point out here is
the PEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the PEA is an important supplement
because that's an endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: mediator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's limited studies on how this
helps absorb cannabinoids, but we believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that it potentiates the effect on the
absorption rate of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously we knew when Nicole was
diagnosed that cannabis would hold some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of answer for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know what that answer would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: At best, we thought that it could help
with her standard therapies because
[SPEAKER_00]: standard therapies have very, very harsh
side effects that regular pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_00]: are not able to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have patients that have severe
vomiting, severe anxiety, severe pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the conventional tools that
oncologists have are not that effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they want to convince us of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD really offers a much better response
to mitigate those side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the protocol that we figured
out for Nicole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see, this is the, sorry about
that, this is the collection of the
[SPEAKER_00]: effective result of all the certificate of
analysis that we did on seven different
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those range from high CBD cultivars to
high THC cultivars, some one to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that she was taking some
pretty heavy doses of THC over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we titrated slowly to
desensitize her to the motor-empowering
[SPEAKER_00]: effects that cannabinoids have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can thank our mentor, Dr. Dustin
Sulock, for providing that protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, you know, one thing that I want to
point out with this is that if patients
[SPEAKER_00]: are seeking to use cannabis in their
cancer treatments, if you see the amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: that Nicole was taking, you can't just go
buy this at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order for us to create these
medicines and make sure that they were the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest quality, first of all we had to
build a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to understand how to extract using
sophisticated methods to really extract
[SPEAKER_00]: the right therapeutic compounds without
compromising the acidity in the compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had to seek knowledge from
practitioners that have many years of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience to figure out how to
effectively dose these formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important to take note because one
of the points that I want to make here
[SPEAKER_00]: today is that even though we're going to
go through all this beautiful and
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful information, we don't have this
available in the clinics, even though we
[SPEAKER_00]: really should.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabinoids have many different
mechanisms of action to turn off a cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the chart that you guys see over
here is just a summary of all these
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms that take place when
cannabinoids get to the cancer cell and
[SPEAKER_00]: exercise that anti-eneoplastic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that cannabinoids are amongst
the most potent adaptogens in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we take phytocannabinoids,
we strengthen our endocannabinoid tone,
[SPEAKER_00]: which produces homeostasis across all of
our physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these compounds have been found in
preclinical studies to work
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistically with, specifically with
HER2 targeted therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that independently cannabinoids
can turn off ERVV2 driven breast cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, which are HER2 positive breast
cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously we know that
cannabinoids have very, very strong
[SPEAKER_00]: palliative effects so that we can mitigate
those side effects from standard
[SPEAKER_00]: therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to this, I'm just going to go
through some of the main mechanisms of
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabinoids have been found to inhibit
AKT mTOR axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important, well,
this is an important target in cancer drug
[SPEAKER_00]: development because it induces apoptosis
when it's inhibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cancer drug developers have been trying
to figure out how to turn off this pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: and have not been able to do it
effectively without harsh side effects
[SPEAKER_00]: because of what it does to healthy cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to turning off AKT mTOR,
so cannabinoids also activate mitogen
[SPEAKER_00]: activated protein kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So MAP-K signaling pathways are involved
in proliferation, differentiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and invasion of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we know that, so now we have two
main targets that cannabinoids can
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively bind to and can turn off a
cancer cell through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have a nuclear factor kappa
beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important target in cancer
development because this allows the
[SPEAKER_00]: epithelial to mesenchelial transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that are not familiar with
all these terms, basically that's when a
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cell turns from an epithelial cell
to a cell that can actually move
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the body and can attach so that
it becomes invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD promotes DNA binding of NFKV
nuclear factor kappa beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been found in glioblastoma
multiform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glioblastoma cells, glioblastoma cancer
stem cells actually are very, very hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: target.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some targeted therapies out there
that, well, I guess I'm not an oncologist
[SPEAKER_00]: to say that they're effective or not,
but the success rate with those targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: therapies is not very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids can effectively bind to and
can actually target this and can halt the
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA transcription of cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another very important target are PPAR
receptors, and these are nuclear factor
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, PPAR gamma is very
important to our metabolism because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the factor that is in charge of
differentiating adipose tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that drug developers are
targeting these nuclear receptors because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're finding out that if they influence
these receptors, cancer cells are being
[SPEAKER_00]: turned off through different targets that
create apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when cannabinoids bind to these
receptors, these are activated and they
[SPEAKER_00]: have been found to create what's called
lipoapoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a buildup of lipoproteins
inside the cell which creates the
[SPEAKER_00]: apoptosis, and cannabinoids are able to
stimulate this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through the hallmarks of cancer,
we have cell differentiation and
[SPEAKER_00]: progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have angiogenesis, which is when a
tumor becomes vascularized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tumor sends the signal to the brain
that it needs blood vessels to feed off
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens through the creation of
HIF-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cannabinoids have been found to
inhibit HIF-1, which prevents angiogenesis
[SPEAKER_00]: in lab studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the last hallmark of cancer,
which is metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the cancer becomes invasive and it
attaches to another area of the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts to build another tumor mass,
another very, very important gene target,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that process is called ID1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabinoids have been found to block
ID1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to cannabis, we also use
psilocybin therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And initially when we knew that psilocybin
was gonna work, we didn't know that it had
[SPEAKER_00]: immunomodulatory properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just using it because we wanted to
mitigate the depression that a patient
[SPEAKER_00]: goes through when they're going through
cancer treatments and when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosed with a terminal cancer
diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we selected three types of strains,
psilocybin galandoi, psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: tamponessis, and golden teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them were grown by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did large dose sessions,
and what I did was for Nicole was I
[SPEAKER_00]: steeped the mushrooms, stems caps,
and truffles in boiling water to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: all the therapeutic compounds from the
mushroom fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The setting that we used was in a safe,
harmonious environment with dim lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a mask placed on her eyes to
direct the experience inward, because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where we find that the emotional
release happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guide present to make sure
that she was safe throughout the session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after, the day after,
there was a reintegration counseling
[SPEAKER_00]: session that takes place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is so that the patient can
identify the emotional release that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens during the session.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was dosed four grams in each
session.
[SPEAKER_00]: One took place in November of 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one in January of 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she also did intermittent
microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So psychedelics, tryptamines in
particular, also offer potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-cancer mechanisms of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that psychedelics stimulate
5-HT receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: When 5-HT receptors are activated,
5-HT2A in particular, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic receptor, these create
heterodimerization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what that means is that it's
crosstalk between receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the serotonin receptors activate,
it crosstalks with the MAP-K receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it activates a downstream signaling
cascade, which eventually inhibits PA3-AKT
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also, these compounds influence nuclear
factor kappa beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you notice, I'm talking about the
same targets that cannabinoids can
[SPEAKER_00]: influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a theory that using both
compounds, we can potentiate the effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that would be something very important
to research in the clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we know that psilocybin inhibits
HIF-1, which is that factor that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining is crucial in angiogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were the results of Nicole's
treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see the slides on the left-hand
side, you see the initial slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five months after treatment, only three
chemo rounds applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found that Nicole had no evidence of
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a miracle that we
experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know that this could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't know if the cannabis that we
were using was going to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know how the psychedelics were
going to influence her health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what we received.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we prepare these medicines so
that we can have pharmaceutical-grade
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's an intricate process.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the crux of this, we have the issue of
sustainable reproducibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemotype expression, as probably the
presenters before me explained,
[SPEAKER_00]: is very hard to achieve because of the
heterogeneity of cannabis and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: produces that chemotype expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to pull this off, we need some
sort of genetic sequencing to lock that
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need controlled environment so that the
plants only produce those chemotypes with
[SPEAKER_00]: the environmental setting that is
controlled so that it can produce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to use standardized extraction
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used cryogenically treated ethanol
extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we prefer that because it's been
established that it's a reliable method so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can extract the acidic compounds
without compromising them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we extracted very, very low
temperatures, negative 60 Celsius,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So German Pharmacopeic has identified this
method as the method of choice for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And handling the acidic compounds becomes
very critical because they're very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very sensitive so any temperature change,
even throughout metabolization,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't know what happens to those
compounds getting to the cancer site.
[SPEAKER_00]: To minimize any margin of error,
we had to enlist the help of very
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable scientists that were able to
produce mass spectrometry analysis on our
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts so we know 100% of the content in
our chemotype.
Expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why whole plant and not isolated
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know that whole plant extracts
create, well, we have the theory that it
[SPEAKER_00]: creates the on-charge effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most studies have been done with isolated
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: A study at a Technion showed that pure THC
did not produce the same effects as whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a paper that came out of Guzman's
group in Spain that showed efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: between isolated cannabinoids and whole
plant extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, whole plant extractions
were effective at turning off luminal B or
[SPEAKER_00]: ER positive PR negative HR2 cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And triple negative, which is triple
negative still remains the most difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for patients suffering with these
diagnoses, this becomes very critical for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what we're advocating for
is so that these compounds become part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the armamentarium to treat breast cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we draw from understanding all
of this knowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know that if this was to get us
into the clinics, it would do a world of
[SPEAKER_00]: good for cancer patients suffering through
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that late stage oncology
treatments are limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that patients create resistance
and oncologists have to constantly try to
[SPEAKER_00]: change therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have increased number of people that
understand these statistics and are opting
[SPEAKER_00]: to include cannabis in silo sybin and
their treatment regimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recent systematic reviews have
validated that we have tons of preclinical
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence that cannabinoids can produce
these anti-neoplastic effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yet we don't have relevant research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there is a lot of real world
evidence out there and we see physicians
[SPEAKER_00]: and scientists that understand this effect
trying to get this published into the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature so that they can show
physicians that this is real medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not pulling the wool over
anybody's eyes and if we can just get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of that stigma that people have with
cannabis, this could really be helpful for
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to just give some examples of
the real world evidence that's published
[SPEAKER_00]: in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the first pilot study that was
done in Spain with patients that had
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal glioblastoma multiform.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had very, very promising data from that
clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that there are other case studies
that are being published, individual case
[SPEAKER_00]: studies of patients that are experiencing
this, taking cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have small biotechs all over the
world that are trying to figure this out
[SPEAKER_00]: and figure out how to take these compounds
through the drug approval process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's an example of a company out of
Israel that claims to have produced a
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation, a cannabis formulation in
combination with mushrooms that is
[SPEAKER_00]: effective at treating breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where are we and how do we fit into
everything that I just explained?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, as I explained before,
receiving this gift that we regard as a
[SPEAKER_00]: miracle is a powerful thing to absorb and
we can't really help to think that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: for a very important reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that reason is to figure out how to
get this into the clinics, how to really
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver this into patients' hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I really just want to make a
note of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really enjoy the benefits of
legalization and that's great that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries in our locality, but true
legalization, true access is an illusion
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's limited by the budget that
people have to buy these medicines in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have walked into a dispensary,
this can become very, very expensive very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to buy these medications in a
dispensary, these medicines, we would be
[SPEAKER_00]: spending about $15,000 every month,
which for a regular person, how can you
[SPEAKER_00]: ask them to make this expense to save
their life?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done is we've reached out to
people that really identify with what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to do, a group of researchers
from Imperial College of London,
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers from the University of
Connecticut, and we have put together a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical pipeline so that we can test our
proprietary extracts and in vitro models
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can screen for efficacy of the
anti-cancer effect that we're seeing in
[SPEAKER_00]: real world evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to start our pre-clinical
studies sometime in October, November.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to come back next year to give you
the results of those studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we encourage everybody to look into
this really.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife, Nicole, is testimony that this
medicine is a powerful medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's just going to come up stage
really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just deliver a message for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really bad at this, so please be
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I just wanted to also add to what
Jaime has been explaining is the
[SPEAKER_01]: following.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I begin, Jaime and I want to thank
the many pioneers who began this
[SPEAKER_01]: revolution and who started before I was
even a blip on the radar screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it weren't for all of you, none of us
would be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are the heroes who fought for this
miraculous plant who saved so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're grateful for your advocacy and are
blessed to be a part of the revolution in
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis saved my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2018 when I was diagnosed, when I was
told I was probably going to die,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty soon the first thought that entered
my mind was, what am I going to tell my
[SPEAKER_01]: mother?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second was, damn,
I certainly don't have enough money to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: the Ferrari I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have to work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was afraid of everything that was
about to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a high school English teacher,
and I was the one who was telling my
[SPEAKER_01]: students, be careful what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is not maybe the greatest thing,
especially since you're not coming to
[SPEAKER_01]: class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because of the stigma,
which is the really unfortunate part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has been a fantastic lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the negative connotations with
which I was indoctrinated regarding
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, my knowledge as a therapist,
the benefits were totally unwarranted,
[SPEAKER_01]: untrue, and ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: When my treatment began, I was ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a cannabis arsenal behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, a husband who was willing
to sacrifice everything to save my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even after eight-hour spinal surgery as a
result of the cancer, eating away at my
[SPEAKER_01]: four, five, and six vertebrae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctors told me that I wasn't going to be
able to move for probably about three
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: After about a month and a half,
I was up, out, working, driving without a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were minimal side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's very interesting is most of the
medications, as Jaime was explaining,
[SPEAKER_01]: are so incredibly debilitating.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the only thing you want to do is
crawl up into a hole and die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's the medications that
make it worse than the actual cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that needs to change dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is absolutely no reason for
suffering at this point with what we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question to all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you have been affected in some
way by cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Family members, friends, yourselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you have been with those
people while they're recovering from
[SPEAKER_01]: chemo, from radiation, from just the
depths of hell with what those medications
[SPEAKER_01]: do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point in time, if we have that
knowledge, how dare us not alleviate that
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering for everybody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this, I don't want this to be in
vain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to pay this forward and stop the
suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is what is at the root and the
