[SPEAKER_00]: At that moment, we have 31,000 active
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the years, we approved the
treatment for 60,000 patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but 40% out of them were oncology
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they enjoyed the treatment
mostly, but they didn't survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing which I always stress
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis does not cure cancer,
or not yet, we don't know about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a very helpful medication for
palliative problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those oncologic operations, they got
morphine, opiates, all those drugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: cause them constipation, vomiting,
loss of appetite, they can sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you stop this opiates and you live in
cannabis, you have a patient in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better condition, but it does not cure
cancer, as far as we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to mention then, in Hadassah
Hospital in University, they did some very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave cannabis, they put cannabis in
some cancer cells, and they showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a little slowing of development
of cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really interesting, but the way
from this step to curing cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is about the number of the
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to our rules, every physician,
within the limits of his specialization,
[SPEAKER_00]: oncology, psychiatry, pain control,
can recommend cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stress the point to recommend,
because it's not approved as a drug yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a forbidden substance that,
after the decision of our government,
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used for medical purposes according
to the rules, the instructions that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ministry of Health approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lead this process of approval of new
indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with this process, then I'll
come back to the process of approving them
[SPEAKER_00]: to the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each subject, I call the best experts in
Israel about this subject and tell them,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, now I have some thing that I want
you to check.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the problem of autistic children.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do believe that it is very promising
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I call the specialists, those are
psychiatrists, neuro, pediatricians,
[SPEAKER_00]: ask them to check the literature,
to check the experience, to collect all
[SPEAKER_00]: the data they can, to prepare a paper,
a position paper, and present it to our
[SPEAKER_00]: committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this committee, I ask them to present
the paper, we discuss it, and if we are
[SPEAKER_00]: convinced that there is sufficient data,
sometimes the data is not sufficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have enough research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in this case, in those cases,
I ask them to start research.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the autistic children, it was
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now about 150 children treated
within the research borders, and another
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 that insisted on having this treatment
because this was a huge success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the process, they submit the paper,
we adopt it, then we go to the general
[SPEAKER_00]: director of the Ministry of Health,
and we ask for his signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, usually, he accepts our
position, and then we publish it in our
[SPEAKER_00]: site, and it becomes a known indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I mentioned that every specialist
within his specialization limits can
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs to take the form from our
ministry site to fill it, to send this
[SPEAKER_00]: paper to us with medical summary from the
family physician or the pediatrician who
[SPEAKER_00]: is treating the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, I need the whole
information, then he has to add the
[SPEAKER_00]: summary from the pharmacy, which
medications he took the last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if there are any psychiatric problems,
psychiatric background, and approval from
[SPEAKER_00]: the psychiatrist that he has no objection
to the patient being treated by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole package of papers comes to my
office, and in a very nice morning like
[SPEAKER_00]: today, between 200 to 300 requests land on
my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a holiday, you know we have
seven weeks holiday, lately, when it came
[SPEAKER_00]: from the holiday, we had almost 5,000
requests waiting for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a staff of 15 physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go over those requests if they
approve or if they refuse, if it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: according to the regulation, and then they
bring it to my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that moment, I'm the only one in Israel
who is allowed to sign the permit,
[SPEAKER_00]: the license.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning, we wanted other
physicians to do it, but shortly
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards, they came to me and told me
that they were put under severe pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: from patients and families, intimidations,
and they didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they said they don't want their name to
appear on the papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, the only name on those papers is
mine, and I get all the pressures from
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians, from media, from patients,
from ministers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not an easy task, and sometimes the
intimidations are very unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife got a phone call from a fellow
that he said very ugly things about my
[SPEAKER_00]: mother, which were not true, and then he
promised her to put a tent at the entrance
[SPEAKER_00]: to our house.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife didn't like the idea, and I was
under some kind of supervision,
[SPEAKER_00]: police supervision for a certain period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stand the pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a problem, but sometimes really
poor people are really suffering people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the problem, so I really try to
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, after I sign the permit or the
license, it is sent to the company that
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies the cannabis to the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first meeting of the patient with the
company is with an instructor,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean a teacher, a guy who is
knowledgeable with cannabis, some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are users, I mean reliable people,
some of them are nurses, and they teach
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without proper instructions, many times
the patient does not enjoy the treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: does not gain from the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some very small issues,
which I never knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, those inside the day,
told me that if you give somebody oil
[SPEAKER_00]: under his tongue, you need to tell him
first to drink something cold and sweet,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it has less side effects,
it is absorbed better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know such things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two or three main ways of
administration we use, 80% of our patients
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke or inhale through inhalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it better because when they
smoke, it is heated to 184 Celsius
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is in Fahrenheit, I don't
remember, but almost 200 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: This heating reactivates the cannabis and
make it work a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the smokers like it that way
because it acts quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second way of administration is
through the ointment under the tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absorbed through the mucus of the
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is slower, I mean 40, 50 minutes,
but it acts longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third way of administration was
through the cookies, but our general
[SPEAKER_00]: director of the ministry was very afraid
that the cookies the grandchildren would
[SPEAKER_00]: eat, the grandma's cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing, people want a quick
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat a cookie and feel nothing,
so they eat another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the third one, they feel everything
at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we didn't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stopped the usage of the cookies,
only in very, very unusual cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do my best to introduce to Israel
ointments based on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it working in California and in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the same process, I asked the
dermatologist to check the issue about
[SPEAKER_00]: psoriasis, the atopic dermatitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it works, but we need more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more data and research to go on
with this way of administration and with
[SPEAKER_00]: those diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music .
