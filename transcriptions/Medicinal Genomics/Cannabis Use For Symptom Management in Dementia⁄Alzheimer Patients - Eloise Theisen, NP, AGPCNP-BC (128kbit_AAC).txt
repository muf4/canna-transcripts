[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in this cold, dark room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to be funny, but this is
actually a really serious subject and
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's very near and dear to my
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the great pleasure of starting a
cannabis practice in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, I had some early
adopters in the assisted living community
[SPEAKER_00]: who wanted to consider using cannabis for
their residents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my very first patients was one
of my most successful and most profound
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who've heard me talk
before, you'll probably remember this
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I met Lucy when she was 89 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had been diagnosed with advanced
stage dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her daughter, who was her durable
power of health care, said, I'd really
[SPEAKER_00]: like to try to get my mom off of these
pain medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was taking an exorbitant amount of
antipsychotics, gabapentin, and opioids to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to manage her pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her pain wasn't managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd suffered from multiple sclerosis as
well as migraines for over 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we began working with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a very low dose, 2.5 milligrams
of THC and CBD three times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a month, we were able to wean
her off all of her medications that were
[SPEAKER_00]: related to her pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she started to become more cognizant.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was more aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was really exhibiting signs that her
dementia was no longer an issue for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her daughter had actually never told
her that she was going to be using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, Mom, there's a supplement I want
you to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had the right to make that
decision for her mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one day, one of the med techs came
and knocked on the door to deliver Lucy
[SPEAKER_00]: her cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, Lucy, I have your marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lucy was, now at this time,
she had turned 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was about a 4 foot 11 petite
French woman from France.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, oh, no, I don't do the
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were like, OK, I guess it's time to
tell Lucy what's been helping her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a conversation with Lucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was so successful in her use of
cannabis, we actually were able to get her
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis of dementia removed from her
medical record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she continued to do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's 94 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I do what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who don't know me or
don't recognize me, that is me,
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Eloise Thiessen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an adult geriatric primary care nurse
practitioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to coming into cannabis,
I've been in mostly oncology and
[SPEAKER_00]: palliative care.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average age of my patient is 76.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work now with over 7,500 patients who
want to use cannabis as a treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: modality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a small niche of dementia
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of my patients have never used it
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're cannabis naive, predominantly
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're not dementia related,
they're usually coming to me for pain or
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my disclosures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the learning outcomes
that we're going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to be starting a new job at
Stanford next month in the outpatient
[SPEAKER_00]: palliative care department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did hire me because of my
cannabis background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to be able to bring
this expertise into that community and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully change hearts and minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we all know, I probably am being
overly idealistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dementia at a glance, we know it's an
age related.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an irreversible condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it results in progressive cognitive
decline that impairs a person's ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: perform activities of daily living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clinical manifestations can be
things like memory loss, impaired
[SPEAKER_00]: judgment, depression, mental
deterioration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they often will have what we call
neuropsychiatric symptoms that typically
[SPEAKER_00]: will manifest in the later stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm going to focus on
today is the work that I do with these
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropsychiatric symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dementia is now the seventh leading cause
of death and one of the major causes of
[SPEAKER_00]: disability and dependency among older
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2019, the estimated cost related to
dementia was $1.3 trillion US dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we expect this to reach $2.8 trillion
US dollars by 2030.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to click my laptop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different types of dementia,
Alzheimer's disease, compromises 60% of
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to talk a lot,
I'm going to talk about Alzheimer's and
[SPEAKER_00]: dementia today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my patients in their chart are
diagnosed with Alzheimer's, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: they haven't actually had imaging to
confirm that diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see vascular dementia,
which often comes from cerebral vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, Lewy body's disease in
Parkinson's, frontotemporal lobar
[SPEAKER_00]: degeneration, hippocampal sclerosis,
and mixed pathologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the different types of dementia
we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2021, 65 and older people with dementia
will be about 58 million in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we expect this to reach 88 million by
2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year in 2022, 65 and older with
Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still the wrong one.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that one in nine people over the
age of 65 have Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to break that down, about 27% are
between 65 and 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: 37% are between 75 and 84 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 35% are 85 and older.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by 2050, we expect to see 12.7 million
people over the age of 65 diagnosed with
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only getting worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are seven different stages according
to the global deterioration scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to give some context here,
because most of my patients come to me in
[SPEAKER_00]: stage five through seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stage one is actually no dementia or
cognitive decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find that fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stage two is very mild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is usually age related,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be forgetting a name or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to stage three, that's mild
cognitive decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is usually when other people are
noticing that you're having cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some memory issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be performing poorly at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get lost in certain locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to get to stage four.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often described as mild dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I work with patients who've gone
through a neurology consultation,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're usually described in mild,
moderate, moderate to severe, and severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't actually use these stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know in moderate, often you'll see
that they're starting to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: passive current events.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as knowledgeable about what's
going on around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're struggling with their
finances.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you'll start to see people
have elder abuse issues, where people can
[SPEAKER_00]: take advantage of them with scams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stage five is usually more moderate,
severe cognitive decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where they're starting to need
assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is generally when they end up in an
assisted living community, or maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: families are starting to pay for them to
have additional help at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they get into stages six and
seven, they're pretty severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're forgetting names of their spouse
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not recognize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may think it's their son or daughter
or other family member.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually require assistance with
activities of daily living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're often incontinent of bowel and
bladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually need help with eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might be doing finger foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the stage six and seven,
again, this is mostly where my patients
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get them in that stage five,
where they're just needing a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: assistance, but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, by stage seven,
they're pretty severely demented and often
[SPEAKER_00]: can't even utter more than a word or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of options do we have for
these patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in my opinion, not great ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some FDA approved drugs that
are supposed to be used for treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to make a point that none
of these drugs actually slow or stop the
[SPEAKER_00]: damage or destruction of the neurons that
cause Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know here that some of these may
actually temporarily improve cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms by increasing neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may block certain receptors in the
brain from excessive stimulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our newest one there,
and most controversial one, claims to
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly slow the progression of the
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think the jury is out on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just some interesting research around,
well, how effective are these drugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the acetylcholinase inhibitors
approve for memory improvement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have very low demonstration
of actually improving cognition scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, 26%, that's our Aricept,
and then 30% to 37%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of my patients, when they come to
me in their stage six and seven of
[SPEAKER_00]: dementia, are still on these medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I like to get them
off as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we manage their symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use antipsychotics, which come with a
black box warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that black box warning says,
well, if you use these in a patient who
[SPEAKER_00]: has dementia, they have a higher risk of
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use anti-anxiety and hypnotic
medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are not FDA approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have no FDA approved pharmaceuticals
for agitation or any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia
Alzheimer's patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see things, again, agitation,
restlessness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see screaming and yelling, sleep
disturbances, sundowning, and wandering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on very rare occasions, I will see an
increase in sexual behaviors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually, I'll talk a little bit
about that, can be interesting with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common in all types of dementia,
we'll see these neuropsychiatric symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they can manifest like
agitation, anxiety, aggression,
[SPEAKER_00]: depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are usually what are the most
disruptive to the assisted living
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, the families, and the
caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They present significant physical risk to
the patients because they can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: become violent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so anxious and agitated,
they can scratch, they can hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be at risk for falling and
injuring themselves because they'll get up
[SPEAKER_00]: and move really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often worse in the afternoon, that
sundowning can happen anywhere between 1
[SPEAKER_00]: PM and 4 PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5 PM, it's poor quality of life,
and it's really hard to watch your loved
[SPEAKER_00]: ones suffer like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to try to identify
what their needs are, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: assisted living communities where the
staffing is so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get the attention that they
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first I'm gonna talk about dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, on Tuesday I mentioned this
Canike's which facilitates access to
[SPEAKER_00]: public science and aggregated critical
data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put in dementia, there's very few
studies actually looking at dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna talk just a little bit about
these studies, and it'll be interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: because when we look at Alzheimer's,
there's actually quite a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people ask me all the time,
okay, how did you figure out what to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them, Eloise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a little bit of data out
there, particularly looking at synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a six week study that was
done in 2018, and it was a small study of
[SPEAKER_00]: just 39 patients, but they used synthetic
delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was dronabinol, and then gave
them a placebo for about six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they noted that the agitation was
significantly improved in these patients
[SPEAKER_00]: who had the delta 9 THC compared to the
placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually helped with other symptoms as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shocking, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was done in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a retrospective systematic chart
review of 40 patients who'd been diagnosed
[SPEAKER_00]: with dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, small sample size, but they were
using dronabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, found significant improvement in
agitation, sleep, and eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a study done in 2017 to determine
that chronic low doses of delta 9 THC
[SPEAKER_00]: restored cognitive function in old mice
and actually reversed age-related decline
[SPEAKER_00]: in cognitive performance of mice aged 12
and 18 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think the number one thing
that I'll hear from other clinicians when
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna consider cannabis in the older
adult?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think their stigma says?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're gonna make their memory
worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, really, that's our objective
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 9 THC, we know binds with CB1
receptors, and the restoration of CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling in older adults might be
effective strategy to treat age-related
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive impairments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I focus predominantly on symptom
management in my practice, but I will show
[SPEAKER_00]: you a couple studies about can we use
cannabis to prevent dementia Alzheimer's
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study done at Harvard in 2016 looked,
again, a very small one, but they found
[SPEAKER_00]: that cognitive function improved in 24
adults who smoked cannabis for three
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they also reported better
sleep, less depression, and a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in their use of medications such
as opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do wanna use cannabinoids to
describe in my patients when they're on
[SPEAKER_00]: polypharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a meta-analysis systematic
review performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were looking to determine the level
of evidence, both qualitative and
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative, to support the efficacy and
safety of using cannabinoids as a
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually hard for them to draw a
conclusion, so they had nine publications
[SPEAKER_00]: including data from six clinical trials
with 422 patient treatments, psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids or placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they couldn't draw a conclusion whether
or not the psychoactive cannabinoids were
[SPEAKER_00]: effective in the treatment of
neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: agitation and aggression.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pilot study done in Geneva,
only 10 females, and actually dementia
[SPEAKER_00]: does affect females more than males,
about 60 to 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely see that in my practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have more women than men with dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these 10 patients, they were trying
to treat their severe behavioral problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started out with an oral THC CBD
extract, and you can see the progression
[SPEAKER_00]: here between two weeks to two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did do some dose escalations here and
ended up with about a two to one CBD to
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep pushing this, so if I fall over,
just, you know, we'll have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually had a 40% reduction in the
Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory score
[SPEAKER_00]: after two months with a CBD two to one THC
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another systematic review of clinical
effectiveness and guidelines for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis treatment and dementia,
this was done in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at 12 studies from 97 to
2019, so that included six randomized
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled trials, two cohorts,
four case studies, for a total of 178
[SPEAKER_00]: patients 65 years and older.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had administered cannabinoids
including dronabinol as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-derived delta-9 THC and nabolones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is also synthetic THC, it's known as
sesamate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their dosages range from 2.5 to seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are low dosages, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, when Dr. Goldstein was up
here earlier talking about having poor
[SPEAKER_00]: access to low THC products, I have the
same issue for my older adult patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: my dementia patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly hard right now because I,
as you'll see, I start them on two
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do tinctures, and I'll talk about
that in a minute why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four of the seven, sorry, four of the 12
primary studies noted significant
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement of the neuropsychiatric
symptoms in the cannabis group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eight studies didn't find any evidence
to support cannabinoids in the treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: of dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question for me here is,
are we looking at issues because there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum versus an isolate here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do we see better results?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna talk about what I see in my
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at, you know, can cannabinoids
actually help in the treatment or
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention of Alzheimer's disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some preclinical research that's
promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that cannabinoids have been shown
to cause vasodilation of brain blood
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels and increase cerebral blood flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the possibility of using
cannabinoids in Alzheimer's disease where
[SPEAKER_00]: cerebral flow is decreased and could
improve cerebral perfusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a study that found CBD
reduced the infarct volume in animal
[SPEAKER_00]: studies with focal or global cerebral
ischemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the author suggested that CBD could
potentially prevent vascular dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those patients are incredibly hard to
manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so are the frontotemporal lobe
dementia patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we have cannabis and Alzheimer's,
and now look at the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back to my dementia slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was eight primary studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 68 primary studies when it comes
to Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So better research here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, as I said, most of my patients
are being diagnosed with Alzheimer's
[SPEAKER_00]: disease but don't necessarily have the
imaging to support that diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that CBD can demonstrate
neuroprotective effects similar to vitamin
[SPEAKER_00]: E and vitamin C, so similar to current
pharmacological options but without the
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have any studies to currently
examine cannabis as a treatment for
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's disease in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD can inhibit plaque buildup in the
brain, and THC competitively binds with
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylcholinesterase, I should have
practiced, and prevents plaque buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one study with 78 patients,
THC reduced nighttime agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this was dronabinol just at 2.5
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all they were giving of THC over
four weeks, very low dosages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the more famous studies
that people have known about at the Salk
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they determine that THC promotes the
removal of toxic clumps of amyloid beta
[SPEAKER_00]: protein in the brain, which is thought to
be contributed to Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I think that this is being
reviewed right now as to whether that's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Researchers stated that cannabinoids might
be neuroprotective against the symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's by reducing inflammation and
amyloid beta accumulation in nerve cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do have a lot of people who come to
me when I'm working with their family
[SPEAKER_00]: member who want to consider cannabinoids
as a preventative, and it's really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: for me to work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't be focusing on any of that
because again, the data is not really
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a study being done in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to look at just 50
participants, 65 and older, with mild
[SPEAKER_00]: dementia, living in assisted living
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to use a 3 to 2 THC to
CBD oral spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be good to see that when that
data comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my practice now, I've got about 76
patients in California that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: predominantly coming from the assisted
living communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, 65% of them are female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their average age is 83 by the time they
come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are diagnosed with
Alzheimer's disease, about 92%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a small amount of vascular
dementia, frontal lobe, and Lewy body
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly starting their treatment when
they're at stage six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember they're pretty dysfunctional at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a lot of assistance with ADLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their typical behaviors are anxiety,
agitation, aggression,
[SPEAKER_00]: obsessive-compulsive behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very disruptive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in these assisted living
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're yelling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're walking into other residents'
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're yelling at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just anxiety causes more anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it can just be very,
very upsetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them have tried about four
different types of pharmaceuticals to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage their behaviors before they come to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're often coming to me because
they want to try something quote unquote
[SPEAKER_00]: more natural, something that may not have
as many side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The antipsychotics can be very sedating
and often zombifying for their loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, they are in an assisted
living community, about 75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that are not in assisted living
community are trying to keep their loved
[SPEAKER_00]: ones at home by managing their behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis versus pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an 83-year-old male who came to
me with vascular dementia stage six.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was living at home with his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: His caregiver came in about four hours a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was verbally aggressive and anxious,
although I never witnessed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time she brought him into my office,
he was the nicest, politest man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she would look at me and she said,
Eloise, I swear I'm not making this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see right here, if you look at
his medications, his dosages are
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly low for what we would typically
prescribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she had verbalized with me,
my father is incredibly sensitive to
[SPEAKER_00]: medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, that's why I'm terrified of
putting him on any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: antipsychotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to try cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started out with a 10 to 1 CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very small improvements that we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, OK, I like THC in these
neuropsychiatric symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's incorporate THC into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, OK, let's try to increase his THC
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try a 4 to 1 tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually increased his agitation pretty
quickly within the first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I said, OK, let's take it the
other direction and go higher CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: less THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did eight drops just once a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a little less anxious, but
agitation started to increase when we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to increase either the frequency or
the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't able to increase the dose or
add any additional dosages due to his
[SPEAKER_00]: increased symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the daughter was really, really keen
on trying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, is there anything else we can
try?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, since he seems to be
sensitive to medications, why don't we try
[SPEAKER_00]: a product that might bypass the liver?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to try a CBD transdermal
patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing that he had been sensitive to
medications, I said, OK, let's take this
[SPEAKER_00]: patch and cut it into 10 strips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll start with 1 milligram
transdermal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It caused severe incontinence.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had quite a bit of diarrhea and
shakiness, but his mood was improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like, oh my god, if I can just
deal with this incontinence of diarrhea,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're onto something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I checked in with her another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, yeah, it's pretty bad,
Eloise.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's constantly in a brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, OK, let's try a lower dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the 1 milligram sections and had
them cut into thirds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 0.33 milligram CBD every 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the manufacturer recommends that you
put one patch on every 8 to 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had significant mood improvement
throughout the day, and his side effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of the diarrhea and incontinence even
resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when my patients tell me that they're
sensitive to medications, I believe them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 72-year-old female with
dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was residing in an assisted living
facility, progressive symptoms of mood
[SPEAKER_00]: swings, anger, yelling out at the
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to manage her symptoms
with gabapentin and quetiapine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were helping, but the husband didn't
want to increase the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually recommended THC for her
agitation and aggression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And initially, the facility refused to
allow the resident to have cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after realizing that they weren't going
to allow for it, I said, what about CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually a national company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work with other facilities in other
cities that allow me to write
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations for your patients to have
this medication dispensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, I'm the Danville location.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, mm, no, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I called the Ombudsman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And talked to them and said, the
neurologist has signed off on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD hemp is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been descheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were actually able to start CBD
for her because it's what the husband
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started with 10 milligrams daily and
increased to 30 milligrams daily with good
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to actually stop any
increased dosages of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't want to take her off her other
medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really allowed the patients and family
members to share in that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes when we do describe,
their symptoms can get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to play around with the
dosages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they're just happy that the
quality of life has improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a 78-year-old female who had Lewy
body disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a retired pediatrician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was also residing in an assisted
living facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the ones that would wander
into other residents' rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was very indestructible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Destructive and disruptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would actually break things in the
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would have this domino effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the night, it's like
when you have a kid that cries and it
[SPEAKER_00]: causes all the other kids to cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would actually have to call the
wife every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she would have to come down and calm
him down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was getting quetiapine and lorazepam
as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't really effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was the only thing that was effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went and met with them,
she just started crying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot do this anymore, Eloise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put him on a one-to-one CBD to THC of
just two and a half milligrams each three
[SPEAKER_00]: times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within two days, the wife stopped
getting phone calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was actually able to have her own
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: His dose remained at that for five years
until he passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had to do any dose escalations
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we successfully weaned him off
quetiapine and lorazepam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when looking at using cannabinoids for
dementia patients, these are just some of
[SPEAKER_00]: my pearls here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For THC, I usually start at about two
milligrams, two to five, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: severity of their agitation, whether or
not they've had experience with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often schedule it after lunch and
dinner to cover the sundowning time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, they're OK in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's CBD that I'm going to start with,
it's usually between 10 and 25 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: starting dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually if they're not
candidates for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conversation I have a lot of time,
because the way that the phone calls go
[SPEAKER_00]: is, hi, Eloise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling you about my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put her on CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already telling me what they want,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I'll do the consultation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say, well, your mom seems pretty
miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit of THC might make her
laugh again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she might be more pleasant to be
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she might be a little bit more
conversational.
[SPEAKER_00]: She might eat better.
[SPEAKER_00]: She might sleep better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, well, that doesn't
sound so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell them all the time, we know so much
now about THC and dosing that we can often
[SPEAKER_00]: control their experience and really avoid
them from having adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal experience is that full
spectrum products do appear to work
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're less likely to need dose
increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can keep their dose low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on average, my dementia patients do
well with around anywhere from four to 15
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daily divided in about two to three doses
and about 15 to 50 milligrams of CBD daily
[SPEAKER_00]: divided in two to three doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do very many combinations or
ratios of cannabinoids, because what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually found is that women respond best
to low dose THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD can actually increase their agitation,
anxiety, and aggression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just tend to go with THC and very low
dosages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't create a lot of side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I've noticed or
concern that a lot of times other
[SPEAKER_00]: clinicians will have is they're afraid
it's going to increase their risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: falls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not seeing that either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Men with anxiety and dementia tend to
respond best to low to moderate levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, like I said, CBD may increase
agitation, in particular in those who are
[SPEAKER_00]: already taking quetiapine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do try to advocate to reduce or
remove that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with the quality of life,
the describing really depends on the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And family members wishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they are having significant side
effects, I do try to encourage them to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider reductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually wait about two to four weeks
of putting them on a regimen before making
[SPEAKER_00]: those changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do I not see falls, I don't see
drug to drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if there is some increased
agitation with quetiapine, we can usually
[SPEAKER_00]: modify the dose of quetiapine or even the
cannabis if we need to and resolve that
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And family members and assisted living
community staff say that they see such
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatic improvements in moods and less
resistance to care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they've become my strongest
advocates and talking to family members
[SPEAKER_00]: about getting their residents on some sort
of cannabinoid regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the challenges and barriers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've heard a lot today about
barriers, but not many practitioners are
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to venture into cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sort of their unicorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Bay Area, for being able to offer
this to these residents in the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: an order is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody has to write an order for them
to be able to dispense it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they go into a skilled nursing
facility, it often cannot be continued.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in California, we have to follow Title
22 for cannabis administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that labels are required on
the product, just like it would be any
[SPEAKER_00]: other controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why I can't use tinctures,
because they have to be able to count the
[SPEAKER_00]: product at the end of the day to make sure
that if they had 25 THC edibles and they
[SPEAKER_00]: administered three doses, that they have
22 at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can't really do that with
tinctures, which makes my availability of
[SPEAKER_00]: products even smaller because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just some of my
recommendations for practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, consider an oral regimen if the
patient can tolerate oral administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not opposed to inhalation,
but it's not really something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available in the communities that I work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider a transdermal patch if they do
have issues with medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are sensitive to it, consider a
transdermal patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are expensive, so they can be
difficult for people to afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider low THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start low and slow, but don't be afraid of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to work really, really well for a
lot of these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And follow up based on the severity of the
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often it takes me, sometimes I get it
right right away, sometimes it takes me
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four weeks to get them on a
regimen, but often once they're on a
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen, they do well for years without
needing any dose changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a great business model for
me, because they don't come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, they're not coming in a
lot, but it's really satisfying as a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are my references.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know to whoever's up next,
I'm sorry, we had technical difficulties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I guess that means no time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
