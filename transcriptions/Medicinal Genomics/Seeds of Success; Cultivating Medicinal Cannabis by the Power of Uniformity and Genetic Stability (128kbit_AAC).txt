[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everyone, thank you for the
organizer to inviting me to be here,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be with you guys and I think
that would be great to take a selfie with
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, today I'm going to talk about the
cannabis, what we do at Laval University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis genetics and genomics and
breathing and all other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first of all, quick question,
who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been years, I'm trying to see who I
am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not successful, but professionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the undergrad in plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked several years on different
labs and even in the level three labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: then get tired of the bench work,
lab works, and then go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: computational biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started working on different types of
the genomics project and got my first
[SPEAKER_01]: license in 2019 when I was at University
of Guelph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then moved to Laval University to start a
new program on cannabis and officially I
[SPEAKER_01]: was the first cannabis prof in Canada,
mostly working on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Universit√© Laval or Laval University is
the second oldest university in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's founded in 1663.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the largest French-speaking
university in America, located in a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful Quebec city.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we are mostly French-speaking
university.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm going to present here is the work
of all these beautiful people,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the graduate students.
[SPEAKER_01]: The post-docs, greenhouse techs,
they've done a wonderful job, genomics
[SPEAKER_01]: platform and the metabolomics platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just here talking and presenting all
these results.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my theme, we are focused mostly on four
different activities in research and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of them are on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly we work on the omics technologies,
like the genomics, metabolomics,
[SPEAKER_01]: transcriptomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're developing lots of different tools,
technologies to study different phenomena
[SPEAKER_01]: using these technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an active breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we are the first public cannabis
breeding program in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the largest infrastructure to work
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have up to 6,000 plants,
so it's huge, so we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a fully equipped and running
genome editing lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a wonderful talk by Mark,
you know, explaining all the bases of the
[SPEAKER_01]: CRISPR and how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the questions was how many genes we
can now quite be very successfully to put
[SPEAKER_01]: in eight genes in one construct and do the
CRISPR on cannabis, and it's up and
[SPEAKER_01]: running and working progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have huge activities on big data,
machine learning, AI, image processing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all phenotyping in my group.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been done based on the image
analysis, 3D imaging, and the treatment of
[SPEAKER_01]: the images to understand the different
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, why cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, cannabis is becoming one of the
top economically important crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since legalization to 2022, it has
contributed more than $43.5 billion to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is equivalent to 25% of all
agricultural communities in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it has created more than 151,000 jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture is not creating jobs,
but cannabis is doing wonderful in that
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a great social impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2023, 27% of the Canadians consumed at
least once the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: 78% of this population claimed that
they've consumed cannabis for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 85% of these people, they've consumed
the whole plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it shows at what level cannabis is
playing a great role in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our society.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, cannabis is a major crop with a minor
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most of last century, it was banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done nothing on cannabis,
and it has been left completely in dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't used any of the
technologies, innovation, training
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically, I do lots of training or the
presentation in different colleges of the
[SPEAKER_01]: College of Physicians, Pharmacists,
Nurses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, in Canada, for example,
the physicians, they get trained only
[SPEAKER_01]: three hours over seven years of their
training on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nurses, zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmacists, zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the biologists or the students in
agriculture that we have, a very big
[SPEAKER_01]: problem in training the people for working
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in Canada, it's been legal,
but we are still in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: After five years of legalization,
for example, in Plant Genes Resources of
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, where we are keeping 115,000 plant
species from all around the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is zero cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that gym bank, there is nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even we can't contact these people on
talking of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no public funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ministries like the Ministry of the
Agriculture, they don't even recognize
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as a plant in their chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there's lots of problem there.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they have money to spend on
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Canadian government in 2022,
they've directly invested 166 million in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wineries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there's lots of problems there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be on the same page, because this is a
very common problem when I'm talking with
[SPEAKER_01]: our colleagues, physicians, or nurses,
they are getting mixed up between cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the people, they think
cannabis, THC, and there is one thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they are not really understanding that
the cannabis is plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't categorize based on the product
of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to arrive to the effect, there is a
long and complex process to produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, to do the post-service extract,
arrive to the final product, and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: later question is who and what they are
consuming the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big problem in most of the
clinical trials when we are talking on the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical side of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: All people, they are saying we are
studying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first question is what cannabis
you are studying, or which cannabis you
[SPEAKER_01]: are studying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, again, a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing when you are talking of
the medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge difference between the
modern medicines and the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are talking of the modern drug
like Tylenol, that all of you knows that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's composed of three main ingredients
with a very specific dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you are talking of the cannabis,
you are talking of more than 500 different
[SPEAKER_01]: bioactive metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a nightmare for the doctors,
because they love to have one molecule,
[SPEAKER_01]: one receptor to study everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're talking that you have more
than 500 molecules, they get scared,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they don't know how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even for the colleagues who are
working on the addiction or other negative
[SPEAKER_01]: impact of the cannabis, this is,
again, is complex because compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: other substances, that there are mostly
one molecules or the specific molecules
[SPEAKER_01]: with a uniform composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, we are talking each plant has
a different composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone consuming a different genotypes
or strain, they are getting a different
[SPEAKER_01]: effect or different in terms of the
physiological impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go back to the biology of high
school, how the phenotypes is created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenotypes is the result of the genetics
and interaction with the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in cannabis, we are doing a wonderful
job in indoor production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are trying to fully control the
conditions to avoid or minimize the impact
[SPEAKER_01]: of the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the controlling the impact of the
genetics, we are mostly relying on coronal
[SPEAKER_01]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, for the environment,
we have the very nice controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can control temperature, water,
nutrition, heat, CO2, everything that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can imagine in a very sophisticated way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are minimizing the impact of
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the propagation, in general,
we have three different ways to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: First is the producing cutting,
getting cuttings from the mother plant or
[SPEAKER_01]: producing the clones through in vitro
tissue culture or propagating through
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, you may know we have the very
delicious plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have male and female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are very sexist industry because we
are only interested in female because the
[SPEAKER_01]: only plants that they produce the high
levels of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we always try to eliminate the maze.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we take the female plants with
the interesting traits, take them as a
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plant, and try to take the
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my lab, we do a great job of having
the mother plants taking cuttings,
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful cuttings of having the nice
rooting and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like other industry partners, we were
seeing that after feed generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cuttings, they're getting deteriorated
and they are changing the phenotype and
[SPEAKER_01]: they are not really similar to their
original mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a question that we were
asking what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to study that, we've tried to use the
DNA sequencing technology to see what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a very nice mother plant,
one and a half year old, taking care of
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderfully well, everything that was
great to keep it in a vegetative stage for
[SPEAKER_01]: that long time and it's been that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have taken the samples from
different parts of the plants and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: sequenced the DNA, the whole genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how it works, so we extract the DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We generate the reads, sequence,
and try to align these trees against our
[SPEAKER_01]: reference genome to find if there is
differences in terms of the DNA within
[SPEAKER_01]: these samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: This work has been done with my PhD
student, Christian Odomek.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you may know him now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the host in the Future Cannabis Show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing a great job in that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then first, we got the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have redo the whole analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did again sequencing because we found
tons of somatic mutation within the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: within a single mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was crazy because if you take the
cuttings from different parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, you are going to get different
plants, different plants, different
[SPEAKER_01]: products, different effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was saying that the clones that is
in theory, they should be similar to each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not really clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not genetically stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a very good metabolic
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the same time, we have a tissue
culture lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had lots of clones in our tissue
culture system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've decided to do the same type of
analysis for the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a lot of clones derived from the
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had 78 clones from the same
genetics, derived from two sister lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they had the same chronological age,
but they were in different number of
[SPEAKER_01]: degenerations of culture, from 6 to 11
subculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as always, as other industries,
we were using SSR markers always to
[SPEAKER_01]: confirm our clonal lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were doing the SSR markers,
very limited number of the markers,
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 that usually most of the collaborators
also, they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the plants, they were similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like clones, no differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this created the question for us,
maybe this is a technological problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've taken the same DNA and we did the
sequencing by genotyping, meaning we
[SPEAKER_01]: sequenced around 5% of the genome and
looked over the variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has changed everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was tons of variation within the
clonal lines, lots of, again, variation
[SPEAKER_01]: within these clonal lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that was extremely
interesting for us, that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulation of the somatic mutation over
different subculture or generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: from 6 to 10 subculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even generation, we've got the increase
in terms of the number of the somatic
[SPEAKER_01]: mutation that has accumulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: This means, again, the clones,
they are not uniform, they are not
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically stable, and they have variable
metabolic profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two first methods to produce the
cannabis, not very interesting for the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical purposes that we want stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said we'll start doing some work
from the seed, propagation from the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first abstract that we had,
there is no genetically stable culture of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis because mostly we were based
on the clonal propagation and the lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least, whatever we have tested in
Canada, there is no inbred line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are interested in female plants and
then the question comes, do we use the
[SPEAKER_01]: regular females or feminized seeds and all
these stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feminized seeds is a very interesting
concept that we have in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we have the male and female plants,
the similar chromosomal composition like
[SPEAKER_01]: human.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have XX chromosome for the female and
XY chromosome for the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a luxury and very interesting
concept in cannabis that we can use
[SPEAKER_01]: different chemical or environmental
impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like here, we are talking of the STS,
silver disulfate, that is the ethylene
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we are applying the STS on female
plants, it has a masculinization effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the female plant can produce
the male flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can auto pollinate these plants to
produce the seeds that they are 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: female or XX chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same way, we can use ethylene,
a chemical that can revert to the ethylene
[SPEAKER_01]: to feminize the male plants and produce
the female flowers on the male plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce the masculinized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very interesting, but we wanted
to know how ethylene affects this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: A PhD student in the lab tried to figure
out all the ethylene pathways signaling
[SPEAKER_01]: and the bioscientists pathways of the
ethylene and all the genes located on
[SPEAKER_01]: different part of the genome and how these
genes affect the sexuality in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, we have the plants that they
are similar either in organs, like the
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomal composition, or they are
similar in terms of the floral organ.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have tried to divide the
ethylene-related genes on three different
[SPEAKER_01]: categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Karyotype concordance, that they are
expressed in the same way as the
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are based on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they are related to floral organ
component, or they are the unique ERG's to
[SPEAKER_01]: find out the genes that they are involved
in sex plasticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really interesting work,
and the follow-up works they are underway
[SPEAKER_01]: for this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are trying to understand the basis
of the feminized seeds because it will be
[SPEAKER_01]: the basis of our breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we know we need to have seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to develop a breeding program for
the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first step to create the breeding
program was to create a funding germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done a wonderful job trying to
look at every work discussing with mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: every single cannabis industry in Canada
to create a representative panel of 200
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis excision, representative of a
Canadian legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have phenotype all these different
genetics for more than 20 traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even we have created a different
descriptor how to study the different
[SPEAKER_01]: traits or the agronomic traits or
morphological traits in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have genotypes, sequence, all these
lines with the high-density GBS having
[SPEAKER_01]: more than 800,000 genetic variants,
SNP, single nucleotide variants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have chemotyped them for
cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: During phenotyping, we had some
interesting results because for some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these genetics, all of them, they were not
coming from the same source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for some of the genetics, we were able
to only have cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some of them, we had only the
feminized seeds, some regular seeds and so
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: During phenotyping, we found something
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, between the plants derived
from a regular female or feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: we didn't saw that much difference in
terms of the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the plants that deriving from the
cuttings or seeds, there was a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had two different categories of the
plants either derived from cuttings or
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second step was to develop the
trait-specific markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to quickly advance the breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have done a wonderful job of
phenotyping, then try to correlate all
[SPEAKER_01]: these phenotype with genetic variants to
find the genomic regions that controlling
[SPEAKER_01]: these different traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to develop many markers that
now we are using in our breeding program
[SPEAKER_01]: to advance our lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that was interesting during
this analysis of the genetic diversity or
[SPEAKER_01]: population genetic analysis within
Canadian legal market, we found that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have a very, very, very low genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's talking that there is lots of
diversity in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is none.
[SPEAKER_01]: In North America, soybean is famous of not
having any genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole soybean in North America derived
from 19 funder lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genetic diversity in cannabis,
we found, is lower than soybean.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is scary for the future of the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is no population structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we assumed that everyone was only
interested in THC and forgot whole concept
[SPEAKER_01]: of the genetic diversity and other traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we optimized the selection practices
in our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have now fully optimized a speed
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can go from seed to seed in around
13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can advance at least three to four
generation per year that increase our
[SPEAKER_01]: chance of producing new cultivars very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we have optimized genomic selection
process for whom who are not familiar with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have produced a training population
that 200 accession that I've told you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've phenotype, genotype, chemotype them
very extensively.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this data, we have created a model
for the selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we do the crosses from the breeding
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as the plants germinate,
we take a small sample of the DNA,
[SPEAKER_01]: we sequence and feed the genotyping data
into model to try to predict the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't wait long to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this helps us to create a very large
breeding population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we produce more than 30,000 plants per
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't phenotype all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So based on this methodology, we can do a
quick selection process.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the genomic selection,
so we had tons of the markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done the single traits, the genomic
selection here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just showing you the Delta 90HC
percentage based on the genomic selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: different traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can, for example, with the random
forest machine learning base tool,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can predict with 60% accuracy the
progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is wonderful in terms of the
validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have developed a new AI-based
algorithms that we are now doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-trait genomic selection,
integrating traits and also markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on that, we've reduced a number of
the markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with only phenotyping THCA and six
markers, we can predict the phenotype with
[SPEAKER_01]: 85% accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is absolutely wonderful for the
breeding purposes, how well we can predict
[SPEAKER_01]: and select the next progenies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis research is in infancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a plant, and we need to
stabilize its genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to understand the plants before
going to do any preclinical or clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: A uniform and reproducible product is
required for the clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge problem currently,
even now we are seeing in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: because for the clinical trials we are
getting samples from the stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are not the uniform, and creates all
these products and results that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing in the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure lines are the future of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genomic selection and the speed breaking
will speed up this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still need to explore the genetic
basis of the different traits and
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how the biology of the cannabis
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be happy to take any question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very interesting work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very curious how there seems to be a
bit of a contradiction that if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing tissue to tissue variation in
cannabis, how can cannabis then not be a
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse species?
[SPEAKER_00]: In our experience, when we sequence
clones, we don't see hundreds of thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of variants between clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's just a selection bias of
the things that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There certainly could be cultivars out
there that have a higher suboclonal
[SPEAKER_00]: variation rate that we haven't surveyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just trying to resolve those two
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing hundreds of thousands of
variants between tissues, but then seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: very little genetic diversity amongst the
hundreds of cultivars you're surveying in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, those to me seem to be a bit at
odds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there is two different
concepts we are discussing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the variation within the clonal lines
and the somatic mutation that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing within the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we are talking of those thousands of
the variants, when we compare it to
[SPEAKER_01]: accession, it's not that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's very high within the clonal
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the genetic diversity that we are
seeing or that exists, I think it's mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the somatic mutation that we are
seeing, rather than a real genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we have a problem of the
funder effect in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've lost the genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the existing genetic diversity that
exists derived from this type of the
[SPEAKER_01]: variation that we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why there is a variation,
but not genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's the basis of our
genetic diversity and not a real genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity derived from the natural lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
