[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everyone, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, making CBD a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to talk about in
2020 and I'm really sorry to do the bait
[SPEAKER_00]: and switch on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were really looking forward to do that
project but a few things came up and this
[SPEAKER_00]: is what we're going to be talking about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first about who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're Delic Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a contract research organisation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We prize collaboration with everyone we
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try and bring as much of the
scientific method as possible to counter
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try and make information more
widely available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of collaboration with the
University of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually based on campus-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've got access to a lot of
instrumentation that a regular lab just
[SPEAKER_00]: simply cannot afford through our industry
collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also like to do a lot of
collaborations with other people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monica and Linda are two examples of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, our research topics are chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a bunch of chemistry nerds who
that's what makes us happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the comp guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is computational medicinal
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, drug design and molecular modelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sort of on board as data and that
side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of them are very interested in
organic synthetic chemistry, analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry and those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we work on is anything that is a
biomolecule and is regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gets us off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're lucky enough in Canada that we
have what's called a Section 4554.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, my dyslexia is kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's Section 54, which is an
exemption to do psychedelic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can work with a whole range of
interesting biomolecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some DMT stuff, some
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some psilocin and those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today I'm going to talk about a client
project we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our client, unfortunately I can't talk as
much about this as I would like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say our client was a multinational.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to develop an enhanced CBD
vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they engaged us to do was a
virtual ligand screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're screening potential molecules in
computer simulations to try and reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: their in vitro and their in vivo load.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, I really wish I could talk more
about this, but I really can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I can say is that we were looking for
terpenes that are expressed in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're looking for agonism at the
Gaboray receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking for the CNS GABA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the medics can probably have a little
bit of a guess what we might be trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first I want to talk about virtual
screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is the process that you would go
through to determine how you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do your virtual screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the first question is what do you know
about the protein of interest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any structural information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just have a sequence?
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, we actually had some protein
structural information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are crystal structures of the GABA
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that means we can go along and do some
docking, which is just in silico placing
[SPEAKER_00]: ligands on the protein and seeing where
they interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, that may even answer
some of your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other routes you can go
after that, which I'll take you through as
[SPEAKER_00]: we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what was the plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first step was to have a look at
the existing crystal structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: See where the current molecules were
interacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing how we could see if we can find out
how a terpene might bind in those same
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare any of the ligands and to those
native crystal structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's just see if we can jam some
ligands in there and see if they're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I should point out, ligands in this
case really just means small molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a throwback to inorganic chemistry
where you're chelating to a metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inorganic chemists hate us molecular
modelers using this, but at least we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: call them ligands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a little bit about GABA, the receptor,
the ion channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endogenous ligand is GABA aminobutyric
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really common neuro-signaler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are multiple subtypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each comprised, each of the subunits have
different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the subtypes are comprised of
different versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a little idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a complex protein structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there are these five protein subunits
that all come together to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: transmembrane pore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ion channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what it does is it depolarizes
synapses, which is an inhibitory
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It calms you down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important thing is this picture down
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see here is that there are two
GABA sites and there is another one there
[SPEAKER_00]: that is labeled the benzodiazepine site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was the site that we were
targeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we wanted to interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been shown that it sort of acts
as an allosteric modulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it doesn't make the channel turn on by
stimulating that site at all, but it does
[SPEAKER_00]: potentiate GABA's effect on that receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing to note is that all of
these sites are at the interface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: two proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you really need to be studying the
complex as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just look at one of the
subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now we went on and did some literature
research before I jumped into the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that there is limited
evidence of terpenes interacting with GABA
[SPEAKER_00]: and having an agonist effect, which is
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's some good news at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a whole lot of pharmaceuticals
that are well known to interact with GABA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some crystal structures out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I found very quickly is that the
quality of those crystal structures varies
[SPEAKER_00]: hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because GABA is such a complicated protein
and it's membrane bound, the only way you
[SPEAKER_00]: can really get it to crystallize well is
by using some pretty unrepresentative
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up throwing a lot of detergent in
there to get it to actually crystallize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is that the
conformations get distorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up with a structure that's not
particularly representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classically, it's down in the
transmembrane domain that they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: collapse on the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get some rotations and some
twists.
[SPEAKER_00]: That turned out to be a little bit of a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get to that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the gist is that it's thought that CBD
does activate GABA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were interested in looking at CBD
at GABA as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's thought that GABA doesn't
actually, sorry, CBD doesn't actually bind
[SPEAKER_00]: at the benzodiazepine site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It binds down in the transmembrane domain
on a cleft on those proteins down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that area is heavily distressed,
distorted in the crystal structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes it much harder to model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up here, we're looking at the
benzodiazepine site here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the two different crystal
structures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 6-HUO and 6-DT5, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: In green, you can see the 6-D6-5
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I've got that red arrow,
I'm showing that the two structures are
[SPEAKER_00]: quite distorted in comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white ribbon basically means it's
forming a beta sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the sort of structure you'd be
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green wiggly lines represent loop
structures, which are normal in a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do expect to see loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't expect to see them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that's showing is that in the
process of crystallizing, that structure
[SPEAKER_00]: has been distorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so on to the in vitro data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, people use
benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo, yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, most of those were developed a
long, long, long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did is they just stuck them
in humans until they saw it working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went, great, it's the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not easy to find out how strongly
a compound binds to GABA alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really just isolate GABA,
stick a molecule, on it, find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration it is actually binding at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these assays are done through
patch clamps, which is where you express
[SPEAKER_00]: the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it's a frog ovary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you run a voltage across it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're looking for the calcium
transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're actually doing is a
functional assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really doing a binding assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't do a classic washout
assay here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found a whole range of different
values.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find any binding data at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some IC50 data, which was
confusing, because it's not inhibitory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know why it was labeled IC50.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some EC50, which is what I was
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the numbers I'm showing here are
averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they differed by orders of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're brave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to push on anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're paying us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, right, well, the first thing
to do is we know linalool works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dock linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, that's actually the GABA
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And linalool, in green, lies beautifully
on top of GABA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, great, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it binds to GABA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it bound to the benzodiazepine
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it bound to about 15 different sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, oh, docking, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can select anywhere on the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can dock linalool to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh, dear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't going to be selective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we actually indicate what's
working and what's not?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, right, what we really need
is some binding energy calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a way of calculating how
strongly it's docking to a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, does it actually want to be there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the basic gist is that there is a
state function between freely floating
[SPEAKER_00]: ligands and the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go through a transition
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they collapse down into their
bound conformations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both adapt their conformations a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their lower energies change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a favorable binding,
you'll have a total drop in energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is molecular mechanics and
generalized born surface area
[SPEAKER_00]: approximation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not particularly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I'm here is to say is that there is a
way of calculating this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it with a computational
simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does neglect entropy, which is an
important part of that equation I showed
[SPEAKER_00]: you earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The justification is that usually use a
co-generic set of ligands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a whole lot of ligands that look like
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've just got small variations in
functional groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can assume that they all have
similar functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have similar entropies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can cancel that term out across a
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was testing a broad range of terpenes,
which are not co-generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that assumption was a little
questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the work anyway, because you've
got to see how it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just the control compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just the pharmaceutical
compounds that we have some estimates of
[SPEAKER_00]: their binding energy predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see in the molecular
dynamics is I actually have a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have negative correlation to the
binding energies, which is not a great
[SPEAKER_00]: sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: The docking energies are so varied that
while I do have a positive correlation,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you look at the R values,
they're basically random.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not much use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still remember my chemistry lecturer
explaining this one to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, all of those assumptions were
just garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we needed to find a new way of tackling
this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Docking scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Docking scores are used to weight the
confirmations that the molecules are
[SPEAKER_00]: adapting and see which ones are favored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good way of showing what the
most probable confirmation is if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the binding site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not very good for comparing
between molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they're additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a molecule has more atoms,
it will get a higher score.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are ways you can game that
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ensemble docking is one of those ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I think it's the next
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the general gist is that you dock to a
whole lot of different protein
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dock to the same site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're looking for is how does
the binding score change as you change the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein confirmation?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you'd really be hoping for is that a
ligand has the ability to adopt different
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmations to adapt to the change in
the binding site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the problems that we always have
is we get presented with these beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: crystal structures, which is this lovely
static model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is they're under Brownian
motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all vibrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all moving a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that confirmation is adapting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a molecule that is
incredibly rigid, then it needs to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive energy bonus to really stabilize
that confirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times when maybe you want
actually a flexible ligand so it can adapt
[SPEAKER_00]: to a whole range of protein confirmations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're really looking for there
is that you get a nice constant score so
[SPEAKER_00]: that even though the ligand is changing
confirmation, that the docking score
[SPEAKER_00]: stays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to see a wide range in
docking scores for different protein
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are three example protein
confirmations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are taken from a molecular
dynamic simulation, which is where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing Newtonian forces to act on the
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's vibrating away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You raise it to a normal temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give it natural motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you do is you take a series of
snapshots through that trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get different protein
confirmations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you dock back into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've highlighted here is three
areas where that protein, which is close
[SPEAKER_00]: to the ligand, the ligand is in the
thicker sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing there is the amino
acid residues in the finer sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In green, you have the cartoon
representation, which is sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary structure of the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm highlighting here is the
changes that we are seeing in that
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary structure, which is derived from
the changes in the confirmation of those
[SPEAKER_00]: residues and how that has changed through
those snapshots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I ended up using was 10 snapshots
from different simulations, which were the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest binding energy of the ligand in
that simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used it for all of the
pharmaceutical compounds, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: benzodiazepine simulations that I'd run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up docking into 40 different
protein confirmations, which I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we managed to do was from a panel
of 200-odd terpenes that are known to be
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in cannabis and found in
cannabis, we found some compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: were better in silico than linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This project is still undergoing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: By our partner, they have completed the in
vitro testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe the in vivo testing was
scheduled to start at the end of last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is quite possible that this product
will be on the market soon with,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, again, I can't say which
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our founders and the rest of the
team who helped throughout the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank you all very much for
your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: To Gabba, to where?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's going to be in a vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll go straight into the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no concerns about the
bioavailability of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think any of them are going to be
drugs of their own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're that potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're looking at
benzodiazepine replacements, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think there is some value in
giving Gabba a little bit of a nudge while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're also delivering CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that happens naturally with some
of the other terpenes that are naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would say is that some of those
terpenes identified in the 35 are very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very minor terpenes in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I expect is that there will be an
artificially high level of these terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered in this CBD product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're enhancing what you could call,
I suppose, the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a huge fan of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you need to put the 800,
900 compounds found in cannabis all into
[SPEAKER_00]: one particular formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there are definitely minor
components that you could amp up the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of and make a really
wonderful product from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
