[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_03]: puts on the CanMed Conference every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: First and foremost, happy Thanksgiving to
all of our listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, we know it's been a tough year for
all of us, and some more than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: But regardless, we hope that everyone can
think of a few things to be thankful for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's your health, your family,
friends, your job, your dog, your bong,
[SPEAKER_03]: blunt, your edible, whatever it is.

[SPEAKER_03]: conference you don't want to miss.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode is all about giving back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the chance to catch up with Amy
Simpson and Big Mike Stramaitis to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about Humanity Heroes, a charity that is
providing essential living supplies to the
[SPEAKER_03]: homeless community living on the streets
and in shelters across America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Mike, who you likely know as the CEO
of Advanced Nutrients, founded Humanity
[SPEAKER_03]: Heroes with the idea that if a company has
the financial resources, then it has a
[SPEAKER_03]: social responsibility to help humanity as
a whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amy is the fundraising manager at Humanity
Heroes and organizes all the events the
[SPEAKER_03]: team puts on each year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We discuss the origins of Humanity Heroes,
the growing homeless population in the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States and Los Angeles
specifically, how cannabis medicine and
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis industry can potentially help
the homeless population, how Humanity
[SPEAKER_03]: Heroes has expanded to help the cannabis
community, especially those affected by
[SPEAKER_03]: natural disasters, future goals for the
organization, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to my conversation with Amy
and Big Mike, I'd like to thank this
[SPEAKER_03]: episode's sponsor, the CanMed Giving Back
campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medicinal genomics believes in the power
of education to inspire science,
[SPEAKER_03]: community, and hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've decided to give back with a
chance to win one of four tickets to our
[SPEAKER_03]: CanMed Medical Practicum taking place May
3rd in Pasadena, California.

[SPEAKER_03]: social media posts to increase your odds

[SPEAKER_03]: All the details are at CanMedEvents.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Amy
[SPEAKER_03]: Simpson and Big Mike Stramaitis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Mike and Amy, welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you know, we're entering the
holiday season, which is traditionally a
[SPEAKER_03]: time to consider giving back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought it fitting to have both of
you on today to talk about Humanity
[SPEAKER_03]: Heroes, which is a cause that I know is
important to both of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, for those who are not familiar,
I was hoping you could tell us,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is the mission of Humanity Heroes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Humanity Heroes, our mission is to touch
as many homeless people, as many lives
[SPEAKER_00]: through direct action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that by giving our backpack
campaign, which we do every year to
[SPEAKER_00]: homeless people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, our goal is 7,000 backpacks
filled with hygiene items, cleanliness
[SPEAKER_00]: items, protection, PPE, and goods like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soap, shampoo, writing paper, pens,
razor blades, socks, caps, blankets,
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that the basic necessities that
keep them warm and healthy down on the
[SPEAKER_01]: skid row.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and that's a great cause.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when and why did you decide to create
Humanity Heroes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we first started it in Bulgaria
because there actually were no legit
[SPEAKER_01]: charities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe if a company is successful,
they have an obligation to give back
[SPEAKER_01]: directly to the community in which they
make their money from and society.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what are some of the things that
you've learned throughout the years doing
[SPEAKER_03]: your work through Humanity Heroes?
[SPEAKER_00]: For me myself, I've definitely learned a
different appreciation for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work for me, just giving back and
helping those in need, it's been a very
[SPEAKER_00]: fulfilling experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to learn that when working in a
big company like Advanced Nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: it brings together the employees because
every day I see employees here in our
[SPEAKER_00]: office that ask me about volunteering.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is the next event?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize that it creates a company
morale that's really positive because
[SPEAKER_00]: people are happy to work for a company,
for an owner of a company that likes to
[SPEAKER_00]: give back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, definitely it's affected
us in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the more and more we come
together and get more people involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: more companies involved, we'll be able to
make an impact greater than the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is getting worse and worse
every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first started this program,
was it five, six years ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gave out 1,800 backpacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pretty well covered everybody down in
Skid Row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're doing 7,000 and it's a drop in
the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really want other people to join
other corporations to help out and join in
[SPEAKER_01]: with this cause with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And together we can make a significant
impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go beyond actually giving out those
backpacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone down and given out masks and
all kinds of things during COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the worst of COVID, we were down
there on Skid Row helping out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you mentioned that the problem is
big and it's only getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was wondering if you could expand on,
so what are some of the biggest challenges
[SPEAKER_03]: that Humanity Heroes has been able to help
the homeless community in LA overcome?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, through our direct action program
with the hygiene backpacks, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we simply deliver a glimpse of hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different levels to the
homelessness in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that we do every year is we
walk the outskirts of Skid Row and we hand
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver backpacks and knock on tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually those people are just
experiencing a bad time in their journey
[SPEAKER_00]: in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to just show them that we care,
that we took the time to walk the streets
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, give gifts of daily
essentials, clean garments, a warm
[SPEAKER_00]: blanket, a warm meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just a small token of love,
but it helps overcome a lot mentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And food for their pets as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dog food is very, very popular down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of folks have pets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you mentioned that some of the
people who you're encountering might be
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of going through a temporary issue or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, that might be a
misconception some people have about
[SPEAKER_03]: homeless patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some other misconceptions that
you typically see amongst people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a statistic that most people aren't
aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: 59% of the American population is one
paycheck away from being homeless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you think about that,
you can't help but want to help.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can tell you, it could be a
friend, someone you know, someone in your
[SPEAKER_01]: circle is one paycheck away from being
down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would you do for that person?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you put it that way, that's,
that's pretty sobering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so given that, you know, many homeless
people suffer from mental illness and or
[SPEAKER_03]: substance abuse, obviously not the people
that you were just referencing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, but a significant amount of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that cannabis medicine could
potentially help some members of the
[SPEAKER_03]: homeless community?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we are seeing some research that it
can, it can help some of those conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that, uh, uh, so it depends on
mental illness, you know, whether you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to give them or can give them canvas or
not, but for substance abuse, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are rehab facilities that now give
away cannabis, uh, to the people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: in rehab and they're finding it very good
for people, especially who are on
[SPEAKER_01]: OxyContin or heroin that they,
they they're switching them off of that
[SPEAKER_01]: and onto cannabis and it is working
extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is a healing plant and it can
absolutely help some of the people down
[SPEAKER_01]: there on Skid Row.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mental health issue is, is an
important one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state of California here, they have
spent a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's about $3 billion on mental
health and getting those folks off the
[SPEAKER_01]: street and getting them help.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amy, anything to add there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, Big Mike said it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well now I'm going to put you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that homelessness, it's a
multifaceted issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but if there were one thing you could
change, whether it be a policy or
[SPEAKER_03]: something culturally or logistically,
something that could help solve the
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an answer for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I would like to see states build
cities out in the desert that teach people
[SPEAKER_01]: trades, give them education, get them
prepared to go back into the communities
[SPEAKER_01]: and work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it sounds simple to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of civil liberty
organizations out there that are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, if a person wants to be homeless,
it's their right to be homeless.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't force them to go into these
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, they're all over the
streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great to get them into a
community and really start rehabilitating
[SPEAKER_01]: all these folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be monumental.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like we don't have the money
in the state of California to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have the money to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that there's a lot of
interference from other groups that are
[SPEAKER_01]: making it very difficult to hit that goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a, that's an innovative
approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really just kind of having a more
dedicated education system in place to
[SPEAKER_03]: help, help them enter the workforce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Computer skills, vocational skills,
uh, just, just skills that they'll need to
[SPEAKER_01]: go back into society and, and become a,
a good part of society.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you mentioned earlier your goal
for 2021, um, being, what was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say 7,000 backpacks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I have that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are some of your goals for 2022
in, in, in some of our goals for 2022 are
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue to build, um, our cannabis
coalition so that we can raise more money
[SPEAKER_00]: and to help more homeless people through
our direct action, um, with our humanity
[SPEAKER_00]: packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd also love to give more support to
our cannabis community who is dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: natural disasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're going to do a lot more charity
events to help raise money and also get
[SPEAKER_00]: more people involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully that'll move us towards the
cannabis rehabilitation, educational,
[SPEAKER_00]: and relocation program for homeless people
that just need, um, you know, a fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: start and a helping hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to say there are a lot of
cannabis companies now that are starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to step forward and work with us and
donate money and, uh, realizing that this
[SPEAKER_01]: is, uh, an important, uh, part of,
uh, the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we do have some listeners who want
to get involved, what's the best way to do
[SPEAKER_03]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could go to our website, which is www
.joinhumanityheroes.org, or you can follow
[SPEAKER_00]: us on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have donation buttons as well as
volunteer options there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our social media is Join Humanity
Heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if someone wishes to send an email to
have an appointment, um, info at
[SPEAKER_00]: joinhumanityheroes.org.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make sure there's links to,
to all of those in the show description so
[SPEAKER_03]: people have an easy way to access that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one of the things, one of the things I
want to ask about when you were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about your goals for 2022 and beyond was
this, um, what did you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the cannabis education, and,
um, uh, I, I don't remember the name of it
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly, but it sounded similar to what
Big Mike was describing before,
[SPEAKER_03]: or are you going to, uh, have a program to
educate some of these people in maybe the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis field so that they can
participate there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that would be like a big picture
thing, but just my own experiences in Skid
[SPEAKER_00]: Row are that people, the Skid Row and the
homelessness there is in levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have mental illness, you have drug
addiction, which are beyond what we can
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but for those people that are just in
a bad place in life, um, it would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: really great idea, um, if it were possible
to come together, evaluate some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: people, maybe put them through some sort
of educational program that lasted six or
[SPEAKER_00]: nine months, um, work with some farmers or
cultivators around the country that could
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize entry level workers and somehow
create an educational rehabilitation and
[SPEAKER_00]: relocation program in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a great marriage of the
two, um, those two projects that you have
[SPEAKER_03]: going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, another thing that you, that you
touched on that I wanted to ask you about
[SPEAKER_03]: was I know that Humanity Heroes has
expanded to also helping members of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis community dealing with natural
disasters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping you could, uh, talk a little
bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this year we've been very busy
providing aid to our cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in April of this year, we helped a
number of wildfire victims in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California, um, with monetary,
as well as nutrient donations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we also donated, donated humanity
packs and warm meals to these communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we also helped over 70 Bushmen in St.
Vincent in the Caribbean, um, island when
[SPEAKER_00]: the La Sifir volcano erupted, it took out
70% of the island's agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were the first international aid,
um, to help the people there, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: with, uh, nutrient donations, as well as
some humanity packs and warm meals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, in September I traveled
actually to upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was a small hydroponic store
that was flooded out with four feet of
[SPEAKER_00]: water from Hurricane Ida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's also a customer of advanced
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to make a monetary
donation, um, to that hydroponic store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually a blessing in disguise
for that, um, store because they were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to expand their store to a very large
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's just some of the stuff that
we've done, well over $400,000 worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: aid directly to our cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're prepared to do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on for cultivators
around our country.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's so fantastic that you were
able to give back to your customers,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to show that, uh, you're,
you're able to help them in a time of
[SPEAKER_03]: need.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and just, I mean, just thinking about
how some of these cultivators are,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I can't help but draw a parallel
here between you, you saying that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 59% of the population is one
paycheck away from being homeless.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to imagine that, you know,
a natural disaster for a cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivator with, you know, all the
overhead and all of the, the things that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're dealing with, um, that's
potentially devastating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact that you're helping them out
is, is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so winding down here, um, I wondered
if, uh, there's, uh, so you'd like to add
[SPEAKER_03]: up the work that you're doing at community
heroes here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, if there's any, um,
other ways that people can get involved,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, please do share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so next week we start our big push to,
um, unpacking 37 pallets, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: 7,000, um, products that we'll be putting
into the backpacks and, um, that'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: taking place next week in Valencia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for volunteers for that
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on December 4th in Los Angeles,
we're going to have a big day where
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone comes together and we're actually
going to assemble the 7,000 backpacks and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, donate to the community as well as
other homeless organizations in and around
[SPEAKER_00]: Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for volunteers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for donations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you can go to joinhumanityheroes
.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: For information on either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what day do we pass those backpacks
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be passing out the backpacks on
Saturday, December 18th in Skid Row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would love folks to come down and
help us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, joinhumanityheroes.org, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get that link out there for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, big Mike and Amy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again for everything that you're
doing for the cannabis community and the
[SPEAKER_03]: community as a whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great cause that you're,
that you're working on.
