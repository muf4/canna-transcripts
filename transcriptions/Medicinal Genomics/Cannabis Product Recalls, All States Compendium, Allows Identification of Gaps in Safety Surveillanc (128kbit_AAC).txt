[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'd like to thank CanMed for
giving me this opportunity to share with
[SPEAKER_00]: you my talk on cannabis product recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, I'd like to share with
you the learning objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn that product recall
information availability and quality is
[SPEAKER_00]: varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reasons for product recalls have been
numerous, and many specific contaminants
[SPEAKER_00]: have caused product recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that everyone knows a lot of
this information, but I wanted to go over
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the cannabis testing
regulations by state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, the states that are orange,
they have testing rules for both medical
[SPEAKER_00]: and adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one error there for Alaska
that should be orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the green states that's
testing rules for medical use only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the green state that has
diagonal stripes that's Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not because they don't want to
test for medical cannabis, it's because
[SPEAKER_00]: they just passed legislation and they
haven't adopted their first set of rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the light gray states.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the legal cannabinoid programs
in two remaining states, Idaho and
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska, whereby cannabis as adult use,
medical use, and cannabinoid programs are
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, I wanted to give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that 38 states have legalized
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that in mind, what we did is that
we went into the cannabis regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, I'd like to
acknowledge that the original source of
[SPEAKER_00]: the recall dataset in its version 0.1 was
provided by Jamie Toth, who is presently
[SPEAKER_00]: the director of the Institute of Cannabis
Science, and she gave this to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked me to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the states depicted in black in the
regulatory agency website, we found
[SPEAKER_00]: greater, I mean, some recalls in the
website, one or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the states that are blue with the
gray diagonal lines, we have, they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any recalls, but we identified
investigative news reports that depicted
[SPEAKER_00]: recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see examples of New Mexico,
Missouri, Illinois, New York, and Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe there was a total of nine
recalls from news articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the light blue is no recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not gonna make any conclusions in
the sense there's two possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, that the cultivators, processors,
product manufacturers have such good
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that they never fail the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there are recalls, but it's not in the
regulatory website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, all the states depicted in
white, there's no legalist cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, legalized cannabis programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention that
20 states out of the legal states had
[SPEAKER_00]: recalls in their websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to just take a step back and
talk about the FDA product recalls that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the purpose of FDA recalls in the
pharmaceutical and food industries in this
[SPEAKER_00]: safeguard public health, ensure consumer
safety by swiftly addressing contamination
[SPEAKER_00]: or product mislabeling to ensure consumer
safety and drug efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some examples of three food
and pharmaceutical recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all three of them come from this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have the top row, it's a food
recall, and it's some cashews,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that it is part of this microbial
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: In row two and three are pharmaceutical
products, where the first one was a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential lack of sterility assurance and
an eye ointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is a oral suspension,
that it's a medication for, let's see,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pneumocystis carranii, which is a
lung, a causative agent for lung infection
[SPEAKER_00]: for individuals that are
immunocompromised, such as HIV and AIDS,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they take massive amounts of
steroids, which lower the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the contamination was a bacterium
bacillus serius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the methods that we did is that we had
the source documents of all, of the
[SPEAKER_00]: recalls, which encountered up to,
I mean, 262 recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reviewed each document, we extracted
and inputted the additional information.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three examples would be the product
type, the reason for the recall,
[SPEAKER_00]: and specific contaminants, or other
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we performed comparative analysis
and created visualization of the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which now I will show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 262 recalls in the 20 states up
to March 2024, and there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: recalls since then in the range of around
25 additional recalls, but are not
[SPEAKER_00]: included in this analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this pie chart, the top five states,
and with their percentages, depicted in
[SPEAKER_00]: this pie chart is Colorado, Washington,
Michigan, and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I must say, there's been a lot of
recalls coming out of the DCC in
[SPEAKER_00]: California since our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the remaining states,
as shown in the pie chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we did an analysis from 2016 to
2023, and you can see that in 2018,
[SPEAKER_00]: in 21 and 22, it's about the same number
of recalls, and all of a sudden in 23,
[SPEAKER_00]: it more than doubled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to take a look at what states
stepped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the five states, Arizona,
Colorado, Michigan, Oregon, and Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: stepped up, which accounted for greater
than 90% of the doubling in the recalls in
[SPEAKER_00]: 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recall quality, as compared to,
let's say, FDA recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here are the examples, like in the
movie, The Good, Bad, and Ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have The Good, that's the state of
Colorado, has very detailed recall
[SPEAKER_00]: documents, where the sample types are
always identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: In almost all cases, the specific
contaminants or other issues are
[SPEAKER_00]: identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, all the different products from
all the different dispensaries are
[SPEAKER_00]: identified in a massive list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have examples of the pesticide,
flour, trim, concentrate, and effuse
[SPEAKER_00]: products of the pesticide contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though, actually, this myclobutanil was
the pesticide that was most identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at, in terms of possible
human repercussions, it's a steroid
[SPEAKER_00]: demethylization inhibitor, and I
understand that after ignition,
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanide is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the flour, shake,
and trim, and another recall, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: have microbial contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the aspergillus human pathogens
in that state, I believe, speciation is
[SPEAKER_00]: not required, so it could have been
aspergillus flavus, aspergillus fumigatus,
[SPEAKER_00]: niger, or terius, and there are over 20
clinical case studies identifying cases of
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals with cannabis use and getting
aspergillosis or other respiratory
[SPEAKER_00]: ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as a third example, flour,
shake, and trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have metal contamination, mercury,
which is the symptoms, our central nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad and ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have is, in many cases,
specific contaminant name was not
[SPEAKER_00]: provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the state of Washington,
many of the recall notices in which a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide exceeded the action limits,
the specific pesticide, was not named.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Michigan, whatever contaminants
exceeded the action level, they also were
[SPEAKER_00]: not identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nomenclature for recalls in the 20
different states, of course, is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accordingly, it's a regulatory agency,
and we did our best, the team,
[SPEAKER_00]: to see the commonalities, and we whittled
it down to 17 reasons for product recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the y-axis, in the red,
I just wanted to, you know, differentiate
[SPEAKER_00]: between recalls due to contamination
versus other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the top two, which accounted for
greater than 65% of the recalls,
[SPEAKER_00]: was for pesticide contamination and
microbial contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticide contamination, almost 40%,
and microbial contamination, almost 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the recalls had multiple
microbials, multiple pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a mixture of pesticides and microbials,
and so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and let's see, going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep your eye on the bottom,
and that's always not provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the reasons for product
recalls, almost all the time, they gave a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you have the recall by product
type, and so the top two, you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material, over 40% of the recalls,
multiple products, which included plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material, was getting into the range of
25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost 10% of the time, the sample
type was not provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here comes the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 23 pesticides that were
specifically identified in a recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sincerely hope that the regulators
for each jurisdiction examines this list
[SPEAKER_00]: and review their own list as a possible
indication that if it's not included in
[SPEAKER_00]: their list, they might want to include it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the top one is the most
myclobutanil, which accounted for over
[SPEAKER_00]: 20%, and then you see the others as they
decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put in red the one, two,
three, four azole compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the primary medications for
aspergillosis are azole compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a microbiologist, there is a
possibility that we're introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides into the soil or the solid
matrix in cannabis production that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: causing the increase in azole-resistant
aspergillus strains in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in pesticides, there were a lot
of recalls, over 30%, in which this
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide was not named.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for microbial contamination,
the two winners over 40% is total yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: and mold and the four aspergillus
pathogens with a couple in salmonella
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to make the statement,
as a microbiologist, in the vast majority
[SPEAKER_00]: of the states, I believe over 60% of the
jurisdictions require total yeast and mold
[SPEAKER_00]: from action levels that range from 10 to
the three per gram upwards to 10 to the
30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sixth program in that I know there are
differing opinions out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does one really get any information as the
sample submitter whether the sample has
[SPEAKER_00]: any pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there weren't that many recalls
in metal contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 out of the 262, we see the big four,
and there are some states that test beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: the big four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was just one recall with
ethanol that exceeded the action level and
[SPEAKER_00]: one with mycotoxins, but it wasn't
designated whether it was aflatoxin or
[SPEAKER_00]: okratoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the future directions is that there are
eight, 18 remaining states that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: no recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to actually look into the
possibility of forming a collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Institute of Cannabis Science to
make many freedom of information act
[SPEAKER_00]: requests to get recall information from
the remaining states where there are no
[SPEAKER_00]: recalls in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are agency websites, update the data
set and repeat the comparative analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately all this data is to
advocate for standard information of all
[SPEAKER_00]: recalls to have a much higher quality of
the recalls and to have transparency in
[SPEAKER_00]: all the jurisdictions so that we can
protect the people and to ensure consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a quick summary, the
contaminants, they may pose a health risk
[SPEAKER_00]: to consumers and that the pesticide
residues on cannabis products have the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest percentage, almost 40% of total
recalls and the microbial test failures is
[SPEAKER_00]: 29% of total recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to acknowledge the
individuals that did all the work really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have four tasks, the data set
source I already mentioned was from Jamie
[SPEAKER_00]: Toth at ICR, the data set expansion and
the analyses and the results
[SPEAKER_00]: visualization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Summer, she's our all star,
she was involved in everything and Nidhi
[SPEAKER_00]: and I helped with the data set expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anybody have any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned Colorado being the good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the best model that there is out
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it comprehensive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a good model for a state like
Texas for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Please welcome Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our state's moving forward with regulation
of cannabis slowly but surely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to institute best practices
from other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Colorado the best model for us to look
at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there improvements Colorado could make
that we may want to consider as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can say that definitely Colorado
is one of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a small staff and it would have
been really nice to line up a subcommittee
[SPEAKER_00]: with a subset of every state and really
dig in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can say off the top that Colorado is
the best and Heather Krug who is from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Public Health and Environment
Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the regulatory branch manager that
oversees the cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also combine their efforts with
the other regulatory agencies to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: MED.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great example to look at and we
can have offline communications to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify additional states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
