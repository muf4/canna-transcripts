[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming to the
session.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll wait to see if my slides get cued up
here and see if I can figure out this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Dr. Mary McNam, and I'm the
president of the Cannabis Center of
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here to present data from a health
care provider medical cannabis knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: attitudes, and practice study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the president of the Cannabis
Center of Excellence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a 501c3 nonprofit based out of
Massachusetts that works to conduct
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis research studies, education
programs, and social justice work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm very grateful to CanMed and
Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a partnership together with
CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, we joined together forces to
launch the health care provider medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis study.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the study partners that
have joined in over the year in support of
[SPEAKER_00]: the study and also to help get the word
out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to all of our partners and to
CanMed and to Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a public health doctor by
training, and I have been studying
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for five years now based out of
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've conducted six different research
studies now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first couple of research studies,
this is data that is presented from
[SPEAKER_00]: studies from consumers and patients that
I've led over the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this shows, we asked in those
studies previously, where do you as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumer or patient find your
information from?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find information about medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this slide, you can see a majority
of those consumers and patients actually
[SPEAKER_00]: access their information from a mobile
website or a health care, a mobile website
[SPEAKER_00]: and a mobile application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And way far at the end, you can see least
likely reported are accessing information
[SPEAKER_00]: from their clinician or health care
provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the last couple of years,
asking cannabis consumers and patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're consuming cannabis for
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Health condition, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not accessing their
information from a health care provider,
[SPEAKER_00]: pointing to the importance of this study
that we conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the health care provider medical
cannabis study was launched in May of last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here today to present the
preliminary findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 354 health care providers that
took the survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: The study actually will end in August of
this year and was approved by the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Massachusetts Dartmouth
Institutional Review Board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the study is led by the COE,
medicinal genomics and UMass Dartmouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So throughout the last year, we had
several co-investigators that have joined
[SPEAKER_00]: this study that either contributed to the
design and the development of the study
[SPEAKER_00]: tools and the instruments or have really
worked to help do outreach for the study
[SPEAKER_00]: and raise awareness to get health care
providers to take the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to all the co-investigators,
some who are here presenting also at
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, thank you to the study partners
for helping to make this study possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is is an anonymous survey
asking health care providers what they
[SPEAKER_00]: know, what they want to know, and how they
want to learn it about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did over the last year was
think about some pretty innovative ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're in the middle of a,
we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the middle of a COVID pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our health care providers are struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They themselves have PTSD and high levels
of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're asking them to take a survey and
10 minutes out of their time to contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: to knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So already, you know, we're working with a
population that is, you know, stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to work on as a public
health professional by training,
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think about ways to not only
conduct research studies, but also how do
[SPEAKER_00]: you drive policy and education around the
data that you collect?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've implemented several different
innovative data collection methodologies
[SPEAKER_00]: and outreach for this particular study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had flyers, QR codes,
social media blasts, email blasts to
[SPEAKER_00]: health care providers and systems,
attended a number of community events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm based in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So raising awareness at local community
and asking citizens to go talk to their
[SPEAKER_00]: health care provider.
And we've had a number of health care
providers and health care providers talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to their health care providers about it
and presented the study in several
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways over the last year to raise
awareness and increase our sample size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we've launched
in the last year is something called the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Citizen Scientist, which is a
program that we launched to inspire
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens and patients themselves to be
outreach data collectors, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And raise awareness about cannabis and
about health care and their health care
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of those events that I talked about in
the last year have generated about 30 or
[SPEAKER_00]: so citizen scientists in Massachusetts
that have been helping us to raise
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness and get the word out about
medical cannabis, about the Center of
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellence, and about this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our one sort of key citizen
scientist who's done a lot of work in
[SPEAKER_00]: calling hospitals and health centers
around Massachusetts to try and raise
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also formulated a partnership with a
cannabis transport company that works with
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of the cannabis dispensaries and
operations in Massachusetts to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: take study packets out to different
outlets and asking different cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: outlets to then reach out to their local
hospitals, health centers, and community
[SPEAKER_00]: communities to raise awareness about the
study and kind of start to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this partnership just launched this
year, and we've given 110 study packets to
[SPEAKER_00]: them last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're in the process of distributing
all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far have reached almost every
corner of Massachusetts getting the word
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a new, innovative way,
we thought, to get the word out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've delivered these study
packets and requested every single
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis partner that they have to share
with their local health care providers and
[SPEAKER_00]: their local health care systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the end of the study in August,
hopefully we'll have some more information
[SPEAKER_00]: about how it worked, whether or not it did
raise awareness or increase our sample
[SPEAKER_00]: size, and drive conversation in these
local communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diving right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a year's worth of data that we've
collected so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had 354 respondents to the survey to
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common profession that has
responded is actually nurses at 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go, nurses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give a thank you to, there's a lot
of nurses that I know here in the audience
[SPEAKER_00]: that are also participating and helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think nurses are a very important part
of our health care system, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: when dealing with cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're in day-to-day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had the most of our respondents
from California, interestingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, followed by Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with our targeted outreach in
Massachusetts over the next few months,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might raise our numbers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of the respondents so far are
women.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have about 78% white followed by
10% African-American in our sample size so
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17% of the health care respondents
actually work for the Veterans Affairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 50% are below the age of 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over about 50% have an income less of
$100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the health care providers
themselves, 13% report that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 66% are employed full-time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we ask them type of health care
facility, it's mainly the most common is
[SPEAKER_00]: private practice followed by a government
hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like about less than 40% of
our sample has been a health care provider
[SPEAKER_00]: for six years or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are fairly young providers,
new in their profession, but exciting that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have such a large amount that's working
at the VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we asked, and interestingly,
and I've always asked this question,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not the health care provider
themselves actually consumes cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was surprising to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: 42% of the people, health care providers
in our sample reported that they
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves are cannabis consumers or
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's a really important and
interesting data point to note as we move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward in some of the data presented
because this is a population of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers and patients that find benefit
themselves in addition to being health
[SPEAKER_00]: care providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: 84% of the sample have actually visited a
dispensary, which is very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of health care providers that
haven't ever even visited one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of those that report experience
with cannabis, most have had a positive or
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely positive experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just in sum, we have majority women,
high population of nurses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a younger population that's
reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're currently cannabis consumers and
have visited a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty knowledgeable respondents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we asked also, are you licensed to
actually recommend medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: your state?
[SPEAKER_00]: 54% said they are licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of those that were not licensed to
recommend cannabis in their state,
[SPEAKER_00]: about half of them said that they intended
to become licensed in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we asked, what are some barriers
for you to actually accessing licensure,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them that were reported,
one, they didn't want to be certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: State body doesn't recognize their
profession to be certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's an important one to
note.
[SPEAKER_00]: State by state barriers for somebody who
actually wants to become a recommender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's other issues such as my
health care facility or organization
[SPEAKER_00]: prevents me from becoming a recommender of
cannabis or don't ask, don't tell policy
[SPEAKER_00]: at their workplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we asked all the health care
providers, do you believe medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: has a role in medical care?
[SPEAKER_00]: And 37% believed it has a role as a first
line medical treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty significant data point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right following that,
30% believe that there's some role for
[SPEAKER_00]: specific health conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 13% believed that there's a role
if the first line treatments fail,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a role for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 12% said they just needed more
scientific evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: To actually make a decision about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of the sample, we asked, have you
received formal education training?
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% had received some formal training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of those, did they get CME
credits?
[SPEAKER_00]: About 75% actually got CME credits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 62% reported that their workplace had
a policy related to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is actually one of probably my
favorite graph as I've looked at this data
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting because it shows that
the majority of respondents really believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that medical cannabis is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just said that about the first line
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority also somewhat agree or agree
that medical cannabis can be a beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: tool in the opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by and large, they largely disagreed
that cannabis is a gateway to other
[SPEAKER_00]: illicit drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting to see potentially,
at least in this population, that shift
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the cannabis is a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still some uncertainty around
whether or not, from healthcare providers,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not inhaled cannabis has the
same risk as tobacco or other combustible
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a really interesting
presentation about the vapes earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think having more training around
vapes and combustion for healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: providers and for patients is actually
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: These graphs, all the top two,
really showing that, again, the healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: providers in these samples really strongly
agree or agree that medical cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate medical therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they also agree that healthcare
providers should be offering medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to manage conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, again, somewhat found the process to
certify patients within the programs is
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat difficult to navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then believe that, it looks like a
little less than half strongly agree or
[SPEAKER_00]: agree, believe that the process to certify
patients in the program actually prevents
[SPEAKER_00]: them from enrolling patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just regulatory barriers to
access or just challenges just for even
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming part of the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Majority of the respondents in the sample
regularly ask their patients about medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use and report that their
patients feel comfortable talking to them
[SPEAKER_00]: about their cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the providers are not strongly
agreeing that their patient is very
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this group feels like maybe more
potential patient education is warranted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We asked the providers how helpful do they
think cannabinoids are in the treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: a variety of conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a top few winners among,
this is not an exhaustive list of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, but cancer pain by and far
providers thought would be very helpful or
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat helpful medical cannabis for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can see seizures as well,
but less so on glaucoma, Tourette's and
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chronic and intractable pain providers
thought that the cannabis would be very
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful or somewhat helpful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, terminal illness and
post-traumatic stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, post-traumatic stress
disorder is a complex condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have looked in this in the veterans
population specifically in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think there's a lot of interesting
nuances related to PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interested to hear that this cohort
also thought that cannabis could be very
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful or somewhat helpful for that
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: When looking at these other types of
health conditions, ALS and Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out as top contenders, so to speak,
and Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see in all of these conditions
that we've just seen these graphs,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 50% of the sample believes that
medical cannabis has some role to play,
[SPEAKER_00]: either very helpful or somewhat helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at across a myriad of health
conditions, a myriad of symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these providers are seeing relief in
this, just underlines the point of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, deficiencies in
personalized medicine, and really paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the patient themselves is
important for cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's both mental health relief and
physical symptom relief that patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers in the studies that I've run and
others have run find cannabis is helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this sample, not only do clinicians
think it will help improve physical
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning and energy level, mood,
enjoyment of life, social engagement,
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to work, which I think is a big
one when you want to improve quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: life and return to work, and also the
sense of hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just in summary, about over half of
our sample has received some formal
[SPEAKER_00]: training about medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: About half are registered to recommend
medical cannabis by a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: 37% believe medical cannabis can be a
first line treatment, and 70% agree that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can be used, strongly agree or
agree that cannabis can be used to address
[SPEAKER_00]: the opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were the top conditions that just
presented around what came out to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: most strongly agree or agree related to
the medical value of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, cannabis is not a one size fits
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some, obviously,
concerns that we should be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this sample specifically,
respondents were asked, what do they think
[SPEAKER_00]: about the risk of using cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it increase the risk of possible
psychotic symptoms, depression,
[SPEAKER_00]: memory problems, respiratory, and motor
vehicle accidents?
[SPEAKER_00]: And by far, psychotic symptoms and motor
vehicle accidents are among the top
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns among the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also asked, would cannabis use increase
the possible risk of low birth weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: drug overdose, stroke, diabetes,
heart attack, and cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see those results here as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the major concerns of
regulators, of families, of parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: all also is the potential for youth to
have access or the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational misuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, when we ask these health care
providers, it looks by and large that
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for recreational misuse of
medical cannabis is not of a big concern,
[SPEAKER_00]: nor is the possibility of diversion,
which is quite interesting, because when
[SPEAKER_00]: you hear a lot of critics, these are the
two of the main areas that people tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about possible risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is concerning to these health
care providers is lack of FDA approval and
[SPEAKER_00]: driving under the influence of cannabis,
which are two very valid concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also asked about sort of the use,
other concerns about using medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for those who have a history of
alcohol or drug dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're less likely concerned of that,
but more concerned about their patients
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to find and afford a regular
medical cannabis supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Providers were also worried about
potential of losing their medical license
[SPEAKER_00]: or legal repercussions for becoming a
medical cannabis recommender, stigma
[SPEAKER_00]: related to supporting cannabis as a
medicine, and then again, a youth access
[SPEAKER_00]: causing health risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So turning into specific data points
around knowledge around medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to be a lot of data points
thrown at you very quickly, and I know I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: also running out of time, so I'll try and
do it as much justice as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We asked, okay, what do you know,
how do you want to learn about medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this health care provider sample
prefers to learn by a lecture and
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific journals and peer-reviewed
publications as their top ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: then followed by news or a national
curriculum or industry training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we asked their level of confidence
in certain key competencies related to
[SPEAKER_00]: either knowledge or practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yellow and the orange, obviously
being completely confident and fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this population felt pretty confident
about knowing how to evaluate for drug
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also how to retrieve drug information for
the use of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also were by and large more comfortable
knowing how to talk to a patient who uses
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis about the medical benefits and
knowing how to talk about the dosage forms
[SPEAKER_00]: that are available for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But less so knowledgeable about the
effects of receptor activation on neuro
[SPEAKER_00]: function or the physiology of the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really less knowledgeable on the
pharmacology and the receptors that they
[SPEAKER_00]: act upon, but more and less so obviously
on mechanisms of action for different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and phyto-cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we asked about a variety of
physiology, like I said, activation on
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons, are they familiar with the
pharmacology of cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors that they act upon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these felt right around the
range of 50% being yes, I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and no, really, I somewhat know and need
more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: When asked about cannabis-derived products
and how they're metabolized, issues around
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling and accuracy of labeling,
the stability of active ingredients and
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and artisanal products, how hemp and
non-FDA cannabis products are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see all of these are hovering
really around half of this population
[SPEAKER_00]: feels very confident or very knowledgeable
about it and half not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And less so on the likelihood of important
things like transmission of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-derived products through breast
milk, which actually a colleague presented
[SPEAKER_00]: recently on at CanEx.
[SPEAKER_00]: When asked about differences between
FDA-approved products and products that
[SPEAKER_00]: are out on the market, less knowledgeable,
really less knowledgeable also about
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the potential role of
terpenes and enhancing these products,
[SPEAKER_00]: or again, the uses of FDA-purified CBD
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some key takeaways, again, over half of
our sample, we have a very knowledgeable
[SPEAKER_00]: sample, I feel like, about medical
cannabis and about key competencies about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of the group and the majority of
these data points around knowledge felt
[SPEAKER_00]: very knowledgeable or somewhat
knowledgeable, but they were less likely
[SPEAKER_00]: to know the mechanisms of action and
really unsure of, you know, really trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to drill down between FDA-approved and
non-FDA-approved products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to close out, we asked whether or not,
you know, what should be sort of the next
[SPEAKER_00]: steps around medical education and some of
these competencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over 50%, and these are over 60% of
our sample, they still agree, although
[SPEAKER_00]: they felt like they were very
knowledgeable, that they need more
[SPEAKER_00]: education about medical cannabis,
more education about the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system, more information about where to
find data in the scientific literature,
[SPEAKER_00]: where to get actual legitimate CME
courses, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to, you know, CanMed for putting
on this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, 60% said that, of the
healthcare providers, prefer to learn,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, through a CME course online,
but they also were interested in learning
[SPEAKER_00]: about medical cannabis in person through
in-person events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, everybody's interested in learning
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A majority, over half, are interested in
learning cannabis, medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and its impacts on a variety of
conditions, from cancer, pediatrics,
[SPEAKER_00]: PTSD, chronic pain, even now with COVID,
or seniors 55 plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's room for all different
types of specialties, all different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of healthcare providers, you know,
different health conditions where this can
[SPEAKER_00]: be studied and continued to be implemented
in the future in different care and
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment paradigms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by and large, majority agree that
medical cannabis education should be a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the required curriculum in the
next five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, there should be more
education on how to discuss and counsel
[SPEAKER_00]: the risks and benefits of cannabis use to
be included in healthcare provider
[SPEAKER_00]: curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education around the pharmacology of
cannabinoids and cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a real opportunity to,
you know, create teams of healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: providers, nurses, physicians,
pharmacists, you know, from a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: areas to maybe do clinical case rounds and
studies and have discussions and bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas of, you know, education
for one, within a curriculum, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: within a healthcare center community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 72% believe that students should
receive education not only about medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but about their state program
laws and about their medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: program, which I think is really critical
to know what they can do, what they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only, you know, what are the
science and clinical aspects but what's
[SPEAKER_00]: the state and regulations around it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to thank the study partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank the study
co-investigators and everybody who's been
[SPEAKER_00]: a part of this study to date and has
either taken the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people in the audience have
filled out the survey and some people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the audience have helped us distribute the
survey as a co-investigator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to everybody and thank you to
the companies that are listed here that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been participating on this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the next steps, as I mentioned,
we do have this partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're raising awareness locally in
Massachusetts through a partnership with
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle Eyes Transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be continuing to get the word
out and data will be collected until
[SPEAKER_00]: August 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will prepare a final report and
publication and make this data available
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the community can continue to
learn and develop education programs that
[SPEAKER_00]: might, you know, be able to utilize some
of this information to help drive the
field forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm a little over time,
so I appreciate the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I'll take one question and
then, yes, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: From an amazing woman, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have six comments, two questions,
and a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much in this that I want to
dive into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious, did you want to say
something?
[SPEAKER_01]: You break down the healthcare
professionals that were using,
[SPEAKER_01]: admitted to using cannabis, whether or not
they worked at the VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, so many of us have to
go through drug testing to be able to be
[SPEAKER_01]: employed at these places.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm curious about how many of us are
closet, you know, cannabis users,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of our profession.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there any data points in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't dug into that, but I will dig
into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll be part of the final
publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there an opportunity to get this
out to people here in the room who haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: taken it yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I know if CanMed, I've been
talking with Ben, who's organizing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can try and get the survey out to
everybody that has come to CanMed to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if they'd be interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'd love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard, you know, that a lot of people
that have come to CanMed this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: this might actually be their first time
learning about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, if anybody would be willing to
do, if you're a healthcare provider in the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience and you want to take the study,
thank you, please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're collecting data until August,
and we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will prepare a publication about it.
I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can other folks outside of Massachusetts
help with the citizen science aspect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, absolutely.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, please reach out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody, we did it as a pilot test in
Massachusetts just to see, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: would people like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would they pick up on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been very interesting because I
think when you, I was saying earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're a cannabis patient and the
cannabis patients that I've interacted
[SPEAKER_00]: with, and they find that it really helps,
they become some of the biggest champions
[SPEAKER_00]: and advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, this woman who literally
got off of all these opioids and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, can walk again, she's the
biggest advocate calling every hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: and health center around, you know,
kind of raising awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just reached out on
cannabiscenterofexcellence.org,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we could sign up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
