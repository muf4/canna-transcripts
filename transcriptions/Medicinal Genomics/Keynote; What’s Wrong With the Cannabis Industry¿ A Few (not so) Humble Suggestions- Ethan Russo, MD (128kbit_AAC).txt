[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm humbled by holding the position that's
previously been taken by Rafael Machulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that you're all there last night to
appreciate the testimonial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have an interesting task.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you'll bear with me for the next 30
minutes as I critique the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and offer some not so humble
remedies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have Miss America 1980
benefiting from virtual plastic surgery,
[SPEAKER_01]: but faded pulchritude does not equate to
competence in a new industry, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: very complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you buy a cannabidiol from this man?
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy stole my suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell me later who wore it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the unfortunate situation of not
having our pronouncements taken with any
[SPEAKER_01]: credulity by the people who make the
decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is always going to be the problem
when politicians are tasked with trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sense of complex scientific
principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're always going to be behind the
curve as decisions are being made.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a situation now of an industry
that's trying to make do despite these
[SPEAKER_01]: obstacles of politicians, continued
opposition from law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legal industry can be pro or con.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to seek out the ones that are
going to be a help rather than an
[SPEAKER_01]: hindrance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The states who have legalized are grabbing
more than their share, and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, has strangled the industry in
California, as we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a situation now where the FDA
had the opportunity to say something
[SPEAKER_01]: useful about cannabidiol and others,
and it totally passed the proverbial buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, the people who have spent
decades learning how to grow this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinally have suffered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the situation now in Mendocino
County, where 9 out of 10 farmers are
[SPEAKER_01]: unlicensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of the ones who are licensed have
gone out of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has led to an exodus from the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that, personally,
it took us seven tries to get a bank that
[SPEAKER_01]: would take our business account.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a cash-only economy that puts spud
tenders and other people at risk of
[SPEAKER_01]: robbery or murder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a lot of unscrupulous people
in the industry that don't pay their
[SPEAKER_01]: bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this just leads to endless rip-offs
and inability to get insurance,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, prohibitive tax structure,
and a situation where there are no margins
[SPEAKER_01]: in this industry, so that very few people
are actually making money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are the promises that
people make.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, timelines are rarely met.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people need cash on the barrel head
rather than stock options, which rarely
[SPEAKER_01]: come to pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's a problem with diversity in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have the rare black farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The commodity of which we speak is still
federally illegal, irrespective of state
[SPEAKER_01]: laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's as much railing as I'm going to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about solutions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is a scene we'd like to see
more of, acres and acres, as far as the
[SPEAKER_01]: eye can see, of a beautiful crop,
an aromatic one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the acreage has been taken up
with cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, nobody will say more than me that
this is a remarkable and versatile
[SPEAKER_01]: compound, but it has severe limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an isolate, very high dosages are
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not work as well on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the high cost, access becomes a
very difficult problem for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a situation now that CBD has
been commoditized.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one can come into the market and be
preeminent or even successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter how talented you were in
another industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we've had the situation where the
farm bill has been co-opted so that a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the CBD, which has been a glut on the
market, has been turned into Delta-8 and
[SPEAKER_01]: other synthetic cannabinoids that have no
place in human health application and can
[SPEAKER_01]: be outright dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I fault the politicians for not
having the foresight to understand this
[SPEAKER_01]: and do something about it proactively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the future really lies in
diversification to different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these can all be attained with
conventional breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to take the position that we
don't need biosynthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are chemovars of cannabis that are
available through standard breeding that
[SPEAKER_01]: provide very cheap sources for these
different phytochemicals that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: commoditized as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, people need to do something
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I like to say, sometimes you need
to zag instead of zig.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here from a paper from a few years ago
I did with Jehan Marku, these are 12 of
[SPEAKER_01]: the phyto cannabinoids of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: About which we know some degree of their
pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that ignores at least 138 other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every phyto cannabinoid that's been
discovered so far has some unique
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really have not yet fully assessed
the potential of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk about a couple of
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is tetrahydrocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was discovered by my friend Roger
Pertwee in 1970.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now how charmed the position was this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was his first publication and it was
in Nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: As old as I am, I've never had a
publication in Nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time they thought there were six
pharmacologically active components of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They discovered this one, THCV,
which has a three carbon propyl side chain
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of the pentyl five carbon side
chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was from a tincture of cannabis that
had been grown in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed that it was active in mice but
less potent than THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was more than 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've learned something since.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically this was on the shelf with
no attention for more than 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the normal pathway,
geranyl pyrophosphate combining with
[SPEAKER_01]: olivatolic acid to produce the five carbon
side chain cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternatively, THCV is made by this
pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So geranyl pyrophosphate, which is the
parent compound to the cannabinoids as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as the terpenoids in cannabis,
combines with divernic acid to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabigerolic acid and onward to the
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to summarize the activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this was discovered in Pakistani
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the first paper they noted that CB1 was
an antagonist at, I'm sorry, that THCV is
[SPEAKER_01]: an antagonist at the CB1 receptor at low
doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a couple of years later they figured
out that it was an agonist at high doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a nice demonstration of the
biphasic dose response curves of many of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different effects at different doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be leveraged in various ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it can be a problem with side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: In various animal work, it was shown that
this produces weight loss, decreased body
[SPEAKER_01]: fat, and serum leptin concentrations with
increased energy expenditure in mice that
[SPEAKER_01]: are genetically prone to obesity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also shown to have anticonvulsant
properties as do many components of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also treated neuropathic pain,
decreasing swelling, and overly sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: responses to pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend John McPartland in 2015 showed
that this lacks the side effect profile of
[SPEAKER_01]: the prior drugs that were used in this
fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The inverse agonist, Rymona Band,
which was briefly on the European market,
[SPEAKER_01]: never made it to the US market because of
disastrous side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually lowers endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, people lost weight but they were
depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were anxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the lower seizure threshold and a
couple developed MS who hadn't had it
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, despite this not being freely
available, there are THCV cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long ago as 15 years ago, THCV
predominant plants have been developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this hasn't had the attention by
breeders that it deserves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's compare this to cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these both can attenuate THC sequelae,
reducing side effect profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, THCV is what's known as a
neutral antagonist of the CB1 receptor,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas CBD is a negative allosteric
modulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lodges on a different component of the
receptor and makes it a little harder for
[SPEAKER_01]: THC to bind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both affect trip channels,
particularly trip V1.
[SPEAKER_01]: But THCV is much more potent, which
medically only means that you need fewer
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams as compared to CBD for it to be
active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of these phyto cannabinoids can be
used to treat pain, inflammation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both have been shown in the animal
work and anecdotally in humans to help
[SPEAKER_01]: treat addiction to other substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: It remains the case that it's very hard to
remove THC entirely from cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_01]: plants because the CBDA synthase makes THC
in a small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: With THCV, it may be possible to get it to
the point that it's considered hemp under
[SPEAKER_01]: the farm bill rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: THCV should be a useful adjunct to THC
chemovars because it can complement the
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic properties and reduce side
effects, thereby increasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic index of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, the difference between the
dose that's effective in treating symptoms
[SPEAKER_01]: and that which produces side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I see as the future here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, THCV has a variety of properties
that make it potentially very useful in
[SPEAKER_01]: treating type 2 diabetes, obesity,
the metabolic syndrome, things that are an
[SPEAKER_01]: affliction of the affluence of Western
culture, also treating addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was one report indicating the
likelihood of benefit in Parkinson
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these areas require better,
safer products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is such a safe compound and so
versatile, I think it's something that we
[SPEAKER_01]: should be adding to cannabis-based
preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doohickey, if you want to put your
camera on it, will give you access to this
[SPEAKER_01]: page in more detail and less blurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a cultivar called Pink Boost
Goddess available through Breeders Best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the medical director of that company,
as a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can see carefully, this is
about a one-to-one with good titers of
[SPEAKER_01]: both THC and THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who have used this cultivar like it
very much and find it very easy to handle
[SPEAKER_01]: and beneficial for a variety of
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one we're going to talk about
that I think is the next big thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabigerol or CBG, what I like to call
the mother of all cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, people are well aware that Professor
Mishulam in the middle discovered the true
[SPEAKER_01]: structure and synthesized THC in 1964.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with his research partner,
Yahil Gayani, both pictured here in 2010,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my proudest moments.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1964, they also discovered CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you to understand how prescient
they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they extracted this from Lebanese
hashish that had been seized.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put it through this process and
figured out the following, quote,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabigerol represents the primary
product and a missing link in the
[SPEAKER_01]: formation of cannabis constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversion into cannabidiol, tetradrug
cannabinol, and cannabinol is
[SPEAKER_01]: biogenetically plausible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinol, of course, is an oxidative
breakdown product of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, this is amazing with the
technology that was available essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from a study that we published a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was actually the first study in
humans of the effects of CBG therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: that was published.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had 127 patients who we asked that
they only participate if they had used
[SPEAKER_01]: material that was at least 50% CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the biosynthetic pathway of
cannabigerol basically from cannabigerolic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid under heater light producing
decarboxylation, you get cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a photo of a CBG-only chemovar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it may surprise you to know that this
was available like 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we not seeing it in commerce
universally?
[SPEAKER_01]: In our survey, we saw this long list of
some 30 conditions that people had that
[SPEAKER_01]: they used CBG to treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over half the people were using it
medicinally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only 6.3% thought we're just using it
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the vast majority were
using it to treat something.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you might expect, the most common
conditions were anxiety, pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: depression, and insomnia, which is
basically the profile of many
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis-using patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the thing that surprised us was the
degree of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at the big ones,
you see P values of .001 for many of these
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, depression, anxiety,
and pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means for people who aren't
familiar, it means there's only one chance
[SPEAKER_01]: in 1,000 that the results were due to
chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty convincing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, these are only self-reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a double-blind randomized
controlled trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the other conditions, we see that
the vast majority were improved,
[SPEAKER_01]: were much improved or very much improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although there were only a few patients
with each, we saw big signals for
[SPEAKER_01]: endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: With two-thirds noting very high efficacy,
also for inflammatory bowel diseases and
[SPEAKER_01]: irritable bowel syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one thought that conventional
medicine in these instances was better
[SPEAKER_01]: than the CBG preparation that they were
taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some people reported side effects,
but there were ones that were obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: attributable to THC in people that were
using a mixed preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there were dry mouth,
red eyes, sedation.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were not seen among the people who
were using CBG-only products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our conclusions were, first of all,
this is becoming more popular,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in the Pacific Northwest
where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is the first study in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anxiety, pain, depression, and insomnia
were the most common symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And efficacy was very high with very,
very few reported side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reports of benefit in inflammatory bowel
disease are supported by animal work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently, this seems to be mediated
through both the CB1 and the PPAR gamma
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor, which is a nuclear receptor that
affects gene transcription.
[SPEAKER_01]: We felt that this provided a good
foundation for the safety of CBG for
[SPEAKER_01]: future randomized control trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one at the FDA can say, well,
nobody's ever taken it, so you need 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years of development to show that it's
safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comparing CBG to CBD, again, both may be
used to treat pain, anxiety, and need
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD on its own does not treat sleep,
except perhaps at extreme doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: At lower doses, it's actually stimulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, both affect trip channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both have antibiotic properties,
and both are cytotoxic for cancer cells
[SPEAKER_01]: without being destructive of normal cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both inhibit fatty acid
amytohydrolase, the enzyme that breaks
[SPEAKER_01]: down anandamides, so they may increase
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, cannabigerol is much more potent
than CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about isolates,
10 milligrams of CBG is an effective dose
[SPEAKER_01]: for anxiety, whereas it might take 200
milligrams or more of CBD as an isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are CBG-only cannabis chemovars
that are available, as we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Issues of CBG and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, I feel that cannabigerol is
a useful adjunct to almost all THC
[SPEAKER_01]: chemovars, again, because of synergy and
providing benefit on pain, sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: mood, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly the anti-anxiety effects may
really notably increase the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: index of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Economic prospects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I like to say that what the world
needs now, particularly in the pandemic
[SPEAKER_01]: here, is a safe, non-sedating,
non-addictive agent for anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: and CBG seems to be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's so safe and versatile,
I think it should be a most combinations,
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations, and this is the way we're
doing our formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's an impressive agent for
treatment of primary cancer, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: the prostate, because it affects TRIP-M8
receptor, which is a key marker in
[SPEAKER_01]: prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, CBG has very prominent antibiotic
effects, particularly against
[SPEAKER_01]: gram-positives, but there are ways now to
make it affect gram-negatives,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it really shines in treatment of
methicillin-resistant staph aureus and
[SPEAKER_01]: vancomycin-resistant, I'm sorry,
yeah, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, disclaimer, I'm the Chief Medical
Officer for Enduropharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is working in both of these areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is a CBG-only chemovar called
anomaly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, available if you scan the
doohickey, and if you can see the fine
[SPEAKER_01]: print, you'll see that basically all of
the cannabinoid content is CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there was no genetic modification
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just good Mendelian breeding.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another problem in the industry is
extraction, and there were a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: questions in this session.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in yesterday about how do we best
extract to save the key ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with my colleague, Jeremy Plum,
who's in the audience somewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: we did this study a couple of years ago,
a process that we call cryokeaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was just trademarked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea behind this was whether really
necessary or not, it's become traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: for all cannabis for use has been dried
and cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's been known for ages that when
you do that, you may lose as much as 50%
[SPEAKER_01]: of the monoterpenoid content.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you believe in the entourage effect,
as I do, following the dictates of
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Mishulam, then you need that
stuff, and it shouldn't be squandered if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to be smoking or
vaporizing the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the process that we went through that
we call cryokeaf involved exposing freshly
[SPEAKER_01]: cut cannabis immediately through a whole
cold chain and exposing it to dry ice
[SPEAKER_01]: vapor for up to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea being of fixing the trichomes,
making them brittle so that they'll fall
[SPEAKER_01]: off properly, also decreasing some of the
water content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we went through a sifting process
using this pollinator machine,
[SPEAKER_01]: a very simple device.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this can be done in a much
more sophisticated fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted the biggest trichomes,
which are 150 microns in size,
[SPEAKER_01]: and these are collected as keef.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Moroccan name for hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to call it something else,
you could call it an enriched trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation, a term coined by David
Potter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to provide one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did six different kemovars,
and kemovars will vary in how tightly they
[SPEAKER_01]: hold onto their trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this may be a process that's better for
material that, say, might have had Afghan
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, where in that culture,
it's a traditional to sift cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you look carefully at the bars and
the table, you'll see that we started off
[SPEAKER_01]: with a cannabinoid total of 11.5%,
which was almost all THCA, and that was
[SPEAKER_01]: vastly increased by this process to 58.5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in other kemovars, we were able to
show, again, concentration of CBD or even
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG through this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did comparisons with material that was
dried previously and subjected to the same
[SPEAKER_01]: process, and the yields were not as great
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the terpenoids, we went from a terp
total of 1.38, a little bit low,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that doubled to 2.87.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see with each of the components
that the gray, the cryo-keef, was higher
[SPEAKER_01]: than for all the other processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this article is available for sale
free online if you go to ethamruso.org at
[SPEAKER_01]: the library tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the full details of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, more importantly, a graphic
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left, we have the cryo-keef.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right, the more traditional
approach to dried keef, and I think you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: agree that these look considerably
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the dried keef, there's a lot of
particulate matter from the plant that is
[SPEAKER_01]: not something you necessarily want in your
lungs and certainly isn't necessary to the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, we got a yield that would be
comparable to what's done with water hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: but without all the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we were using relatively crude
techniques as a proof of concept,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that this can be yet refined.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we were able to show was that
cryo-keef isolated the trichomes and
[SPEAKER_01]: highly concentrated both the cannabinoids
and terpenoid components.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that this would be a very good
product on two levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: One would be for the cannabis connoisseur
that instead of an isolate with butane or
[SPEAKER_01]: some other solvent would be clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would also offer the ability to have
very good quality acid cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: which if wanted could be secondarily
decarboxylated, but particularly with
[SPEAKER_01]: preservation of the full complement of
monoterpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this could be subject to secondary
processing of various types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, the material that's left
after the cryo-keef process still had
[SPEAKER_01]: plenty of activity itself, and that could
be solvent extracted or CO2 extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, this is producing a value-added
product, and yet not leaving waste that
[SPEAKER_01]: just needs to be composted, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this offers the ability to combine
acid and neutral cannabinoids for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of therapeutic purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to talk a little bit,
again, disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This material comes from Breeders Bast,
headed by Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the medical director of that company.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what he has called the new
cannabinoid discovery program.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea being to gain the ability to
isolate novel cannabinoids for future
[SPEAKER_01]: generations to carry on after I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a technique that uses receptors to
identify the compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without exaggeration, this is a
million times more sensitive than standard
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques and instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whereas the latter gets things down to
the nanomolar level, this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: femtomolar level, or 10 to the minus 15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea being to gain the ability to
identify rare cannabinoids that may bind
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabinoid and other receptors,
because not all phyto-cannabinoids work
[SPEAKER_01]: through that mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea would be to screen Breeders
submissions for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an animation I'm just going to go
through quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the economics, THC was
expected to earn $73.6 billion by 2027,
[SPEAKER_01]: with CBD 9.7 billion by 2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are about 10 others that have
increasing demand, as we've discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over 100 of others that we have
yet to explore.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these are near or below detection
limits with standard instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may come from rare genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mindset has been really occupied with
just CBD and THC to the exclusion of
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Breeders Best, the idea is to license
and provide intellectual property
[SPEAKER_01]: protection for unique chemovars and help
them get developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a way, again, to screen for
the future of commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all starts with the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a research license, various tissues
from the plant, not just flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's potential for the roots and other
parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this can be sampled and assayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we find a novel cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's possible to selectively
breed to increase its concentration,
[SPEAKER_01]: producing progeny, which can be
subsequently studied and go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: process again until you get it to the
point where it's economically viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So purification, studying its effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually getting it to humans for
new products and medicine and even
[SPEAKER_01]: producing new industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully producing a better quality
of life for patients and their families
[SPEAKER_01]: and with commercial opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to close with some discussion
of formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very important to know for anybody
who's interested in pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: development of cannabinoids that there are
certain rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is to produce a botanical,
it all has to be from one species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is not a place where you could
combine cannabinoids from two different
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthetic sources and put them together
without going through programs identifying
[SPEAKER_01]: the toxicity and therapeutic effects of
each.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not a good path towards
approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also true in New York State that
the cannabis products need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis-derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would mean that you wouldn't be
combining cannabinoids with linalool from
[SPEAKER_01]: lavender, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the path ahead for true botanicals is
by using all these different of these
[SPEAKER_01]: components from cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't need to be from the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would point out that Sativex is actually
a combination of two different chemovars.
[SPEAKER_01]: One rich in THC, one rich in cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are combined and that's been
accepted as a unitary formulation by
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators in 30 different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, I think one of the best paths
ahead is creative combinations of
[SPEAKER_01]: phytocannabinoids and terpenoids and
flavonoids, as we'll hear more about
[SPEAKER_01]: later, that can be optimized for any
particular clinical indication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is exactly the approach that
we're using at CredoScience in our
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So selective Mendelian breeding without
genetic modification and the new
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid discovery program would be the
suppliers of the components or approaches
[SPEAKER_01]: like these.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is essential, as we've heard yesterday
in some of the sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry requires good manufacturing
practice standards and the availability of
[SPEAKER_01]: active pharmaceutical ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the company that is first able to
supply API quality phytocannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenoids derived from cannabis is gonna
be in the proverbial driver's seat for
[SPEAKER_01]: future commerce in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that a few oxen were gored in
this, but hopefully not fatally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I'm surprised, but it looks
like we may have a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So TCV again is a neutral antagonist.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a way at low doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a way of saying it takes up space
on the receptor, but it'd be different
[SPEAKER_01]: than CBD, which is actually just making it
a little harder to bind by changing the
[SPEAKER_01]: confirmation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a technical difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this instance, I guess you'd say the
THCV is taking up space that THC would
[SPEAKER_01]: normally want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you might think from that,
that it's gonna really reduce the clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy of the THC, but that's not what
we see clinically because there are a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people using these mixed chemovars that
have both and boy, they're usually very
[SPEAKER_01]: happy with how it makes them feel or
treating whatever their condition is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That what delivery system for THCV has the
most efficacy, whether it's sublingual,
[SPEAKER_02]: edible, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, that's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there really are not a lot of
commercial products yet available with
[SPEAKER_01]: THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are always gonna be issues of
bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone's taking it orally,
our advice would be that cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_01]: better absorbed with food, certainly with
concomitant fats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, these materials can often have
certain degree of absorption or mucosally,
[SPEAKER_01]: sublingually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topically, I don't know about THCV
topically, but in general, the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids are great on the skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not absorbed systemically at
this point very effectively at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, we need more work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are experimenting in this area,
I would really encourage you to let people
[SPEAKER_01]: know what you think works.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I buy THCV from a vendor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an isolate form.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has mostly edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found on a brick and mortar basis two
milligrams of THCV isolate in a dark
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate is amazing for focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nursing students that take it
instead of their Adderall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, 20 milligrams THCV for focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two milligrams to five milligrams of
isolate for not weight loss, but appetite
[SPEAKER_02]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it totally works.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Ethan, over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious to hear what you think the
priorities are for human clinical
[SPEAKER_05]: research, both observational and
experimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, big topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be the next hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I've always said I think
the priority areas that haven't had the
[SPEAKER_01]: attention they deserve are obstetrics and
gynecology, which has been a forbidden
[SPEAKER_01]: area for far too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other area, psychiatry broadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, again, I think that just
based on the numbers at the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: list, anxiety treatment, we can do so much
better than the current dangerous and
[SPEAKER_01]: addictive anti-anxiety agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the ones I'd highlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that CBG may be useful to
ADAD?
[SPEAKER_07]: To treat which?
[SPEAKER_07]: ADAD and hyperactivity and ADAD?
[SPEAKER_07]: ADHD, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't one of the listed ones among
the 127 patients that we had, but
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly anxiety is a big component of
ADHD for many children and adults with
[SPEAKER_01]: residual ADHD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that there's a good likelihood.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we know that THC and low doses
works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD can have a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't tell you what the ideal
combination would be, but I think it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: good bet that CBG would be a useful
component.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering if you've done any
work or your thoughts on the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: quinones and their therapeutic values for
targeted elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Mr. Word, the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quinones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a difficult topic for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a history with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, the quinones as a chemical
group have certain toxicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be really hesitant to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, part of this is my bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the cannabinoids,
as the plant produces them, are plenty
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a fan of semi-synthetics at
this point, which invariably are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be isolates and could not possibly have
the broad range of therapeutic effects
[SPEAKER_01]: that a properly constituted cannabis
extract would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Dr. Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great presentation and I learned a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a general question, how do you
recommend as an expert to speak to other
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioners and providers on the use of
medical cannabis when they're resistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: to want to hear about it, who walk out of
the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, how do you get across to them
that this is not a recreational drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: that our patients are just getting high,
which a lot of doctors and practitioners
[SPEAKER_00]: think is happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this for 27 years and
we've only made incremental improvements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, with politicians,
the sad fact is until they or a family
[SPEAKER_01]: member has got cancer and needs cannabis,
they're rarely going to become convinced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just a story you see
repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you have very sympathetic patients
that are able to connect with a politician
[SPEAKER_01]: one-on-one and bring them on board,
so it takes tremendous lobbyists lobbying
[SPEAKER_01]: effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it sounds like you're involved
in that and I just encourage you to
[SPEAKER_01]: persist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to steal the last question over
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very curious about these femtomolar
sensitivity scanning tools you have,
[SPEAKER_06]: Ethan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can they also find or explore the
tryptamine space we have in the leaves?
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some wonderful paper last year
about kynuretic acid in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this technology was borrowed from
other areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this receptor approach to analysis
could be applied to cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's the future of exploration
for trace components in a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to have a question about your
opinion about COVID-19 and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have some discussion with
Mashalem and he's taking me some ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my practice, I see Morocco in some
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have no COVID, we don't have smoking
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think both Bonnie and Dustin can give
much better answers on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you may hear of certain cannabis
components that will help prevent binding
[SPEAKER_01]: of the virus to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in terms of long COVID,
there again may be a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we should confine my answer to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that are in the trenches
and have much more experience with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a role, but I could not
define it for you at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again for your attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
