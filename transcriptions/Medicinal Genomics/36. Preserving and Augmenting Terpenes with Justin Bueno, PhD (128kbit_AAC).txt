[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Can Med Coffee Talk
podcast, where we talk with the leading
[SPEAKER_01]: minds in cannabis science, medicine,
cultivation, and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_01]: puts on the Can Med Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you probably already know by now,
but after careful evaluation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: current situation in Los Angeles County
and the restrictions and requirements that
[SPEAKER_01]: would have been necessary to hold Can Med
2021 in September, our management team has
[SPEAKER_01]: made the difficult decision to reschedule
the event for May 3rd through 5th,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was not an easy decision to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been almost two years since we had a
live Can Med event, but everyone,
[SPEAKER_01]: including the conference organizers,
our sponsors, and the presenters strongly
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that in order for Can Med to be a
success, it must take place in a
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable, collaborative environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not possible during these
uncomfortable and restrictive times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will press on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will continue to bring you new podcasts
every other week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will continue to interact with the Can
Med community on our Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will continue to share all the
great Can Med presentation videos that are
[SPEAKER_01]: in our free searchable Can Med archive on
all of our social media channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find links to all those great
resources in the show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if you have not signed up for
email alerts yet, you really should.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the best way to stay up to date
with all the updates around the Can Med
[SPEAKER_01]: conference delivered right to your inbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that news out of the way,
let's get back to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this episode is Justin Bueno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin is the Scientific Director of
Goodness Growth Holdings, Inc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since joining the company in 2018,
Dr. Bueno has published two peer-reviewed
[SPEAKER_01]: articles in the field of cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_01]: One article published in the Journal of
Cannabis Research described the validation
[SPEAKER_01]: and the science behind the novel TerpSafe
packaging system towards the preservation
[SPEAKER_01]: of terpenes in cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That article will be the basis for his
presentation at Can Med 2022 titled The
[SPEAKER_01]: Preservation and Augmentation of Terpenes
in Cannabis Influorescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: My conversation with Dr. Bueno is all
about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including how terpenes contribute to
cannabis effects and overall quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: why using THC potency as an indicator of
quality is short-sighted, the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between terpenes and terpenoids,
how the terpene profile of cannabis flower
[SPEAKER_01]: can change over time as molecules
evaporate, the inconsistency of terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations from flower to flower
within the same batch, and how the new
[SPEAKER_01]: TerpSafe technology is addressing terpene
preservation and batch consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Justin, I would like to thank this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode's sponsor, Cannasafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannasafe is a California-based cannabis
analytical testing lab paving the way in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry through research,
education, and social equity efforts,
[SPEAKER_01]: championing safe and effective cannabis
hemp and CBD for all, one test at a time.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Justin
[SPEAKER_01]: Bueno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Justin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to talk with you today about a
topic that I'll admit I have a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: love-hate relationship with, and that's
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that because I think terpenes are
truly fascinating compounds for reasons I
[SPEAKER_01]: know that we're going to get into in this
conversation, but I still feel like the
[SPEAKER_01]: average consumer out there is very unaware
of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has that been your experience as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a focus right now in the cannabis
industry to look at THC content,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is obviously critically important,
but terpenes are relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: under-considered when looking at the whole
phytochemical composition, especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: newer patients as markets are continuing
to open up for both medicinal and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational applications as additional
legislation is passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an increase in the patient base.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your point, with this increase in
patient base, we also need to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: patient education and talk about different
phytochemicals on the plant outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting you say that because I
just recently saw an article, I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was on weed maps, and maybe I'll put a
link in the show description so people can
[SPEAKER_01]: read it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all about the author was making the
case that we need to break this idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: the highest THC cannabis flower is the
best quality cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only looking at this one specific
cannabinoid where you should really be
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the full breadth of the other
cannabinoids and of course the terpenes as
[SPEAKER_01]: well to really gauge your quality or the
experience that you're having with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you agree that the industry is
still really kind of stuck in that THC
[SPEAKER_01]: potency number more than anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of understand where this
drive originates from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a patient is at a dispensary looking
at different label claims for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flower or extract products, they see a
higher THC reported value for one product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They associate that with improved efficacy
for treating their disease state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's looking at pain management or a
variety of other conditions, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: where they'd make the correlation with
higher THC content, improved efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to what I talked about previously,
the whole phytochemical composition of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant really contributes to this efficacy
across treating a variety of disease
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you talk about product quality,
that's a really interesting attribute
[SPEAKER_00]: because especially experienced cannabis
users, when we're talking about flower
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, really associate the aroma
and flavor of cannabis with product
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can get into, we know that
terpenes are the main driving force behind
[SPEAKER_00]: this characteristic aroma and flavor of
cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpene content is critically important
for both the perceived or actual product
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as research has shown, there's also
interesting medicinal, recreational,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we can talk about entourage
effects associated with terpene content
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another point that was made in this
article was this idea that the chemo type
[SPEAKER_01]: information for a cannabis flower,
it's all based on percent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a very high percentage of
THC, then it makes sense to think that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have a lower percentage of
those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though you might have a high THC
flower, it might be relatively lower in
[SPEAKER_01]: those beneficial terpenes for quality,
aroma, or even effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of interesting
discussion points around this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, cannabinoids and terpenes have
shared biosynthetic pathways in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at some stage, there's a precursor that
has to be, it can only be sent towards
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesizing a cannabinoid or
synthesizing, for example, a monoterpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may be some type of combination
competition there where, depending upon
[SPEAKER_00]: what the plant wants to make, you may
drive cannabinoid production, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively reduce terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be one hypothesis to look at
that relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, kind of in my role at Goodness
Growth Holdings, we do some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental R&D on the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one project we just completed was
looking at different fertilizations
[SPEAKER_00]: schedules and their impact on the
subsequent phytochemical content of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that, and it may kind of seem
like common sense, the healthier the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, the higher content of all
phytochemicals you'll get in the resulting
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of is another aspect of that
relationship where you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting different ratios of
cannabinoids or terpenes, but in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant health overall may drive an increase
in both phytochemical classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize that cannabinoids and
terpenes may share sort of a precursor
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule that is used to synthesize both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I understand that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a couple biosynthetic pathways are
required to make both cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the earlier reactions,
the same precursor is required for both
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we move on to more of the nitty
gritty science, sciency stuff in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and kind of the organic chemistry
and all those things, just before we leave
[SPEAKER_01]: behind maybe some of the photos of folks
who aren't as well versed in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sometimes my mom listens to
this podcast and we would totally leave
[SPEAKER_01]: her in the dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there sort of a high level or kind of
cliff notes version of what people should
[SPEAKER_01]: understand about terpenes so that they can
get the most out of their cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes are a part of a class called
terpenoids, more generally, that are one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most prominent class of plant
secondary metabolites found in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a plant secondary metabolite?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a molecule that the plant
synthesizes that is not required for its
[SPEAKER_00]: day-to-day function or its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used in subsequent interactions,
either in ecology, in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a molecule that would attract
some kind of insect that could help spread
[SPEAKER_00]: its pollen or there may be other
evolutionary basis for wanting to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: this molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes or terpenoids, and that's an
interesting thing that we probably should
[SPEAKER_00]: define.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, terpenoid is a molecule that
contains an oxygen atom and terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: within the same class but aren't
oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use those terms
interchangeably or just simplified for
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just call them terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is one thing in the industry
where that's another kind of definition
[SPEAKER_00]: that could confuse newer patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a difference in effect if you
have one or the other or is it just sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of stages of that molecule within the life
of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over 200 different terpenes have been
identified in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about the potential
pharmacology of these molecules found in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, we actually have a very broad
scope of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that results in a potentially broad
pharmacology for each of these individual
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the highlights, there's been
numerous research articles you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: online about pharmacology of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the highlights I like to
emphasize are they've been shown to have
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory properties, antialytic,
which means anti-anxiety, analgesic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and antioxidant properties, among others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that last one I like to highlight
because the fact that a terpene may have
[SPEAKER_00]: an antioxidant property, of course,
when a patient consumes that terpene,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may protect tissue in the body from
free radical damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also may protect other
phytochemicals within the plant from
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidative degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a really interesting
application would be, what do terpenes do
[SPEAKER_00]: to preserve cannabinoid content in
cannabis flower or other cannabis-based
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to go back to the terpene versus
terpenoids distinction, could you play
[SPEAKER_01]: that one back and maybe we can explore
that a bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes are part of a class,
a broader class, called terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the accepted definition in the
industry would be that a terpenoid has an
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen atom as part of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terpenes are part of the same class
containing a so-called isopropyl pre-unit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but without that oxygen atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we take one step further up the
chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes are a part of a class called,
if we really want to get into the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: product chemistry, terpenes are a part of
a class called isoprenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an isoprenoid contains a specific
chemical constituent called an isoprene
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most prominent terpenes found in
cannabis are monoterpenes, which contain
[SPEAKER_00]: two isoprene units, and sesquiterpenes,
which contain three isoprene units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can further differentiate these
classes if we add an oxygen atom to them
[SPEAKER_00]: or numerous oxygen atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oxygenated monoterpenes are often
referred to as monoterpenoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and oxygenated sesquiterpenes are also
often referred to as sesquiterpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think for simplicity, we can refer
to all terpenes as just a terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the terpenes that we know and love,
Mersene, Limonene, beta-karyophylline,
[SPEAKER_01]: are they some kind of combination of
monoterpene, sesquiterpenes, or are they
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of all of a similar class?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each terpene is only going to belong to
one terpene subclass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, Mersene is a monoterpene,
beta-karyophylline is a sesquiterpene,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those have slightly different physical
properties based upon their differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually becomes important when
we talk about the stability of these
[SPEAKER_00]: various terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: in formulations or flour, and we can get
into that, I think, a bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, let's do that now,
because one of the things that's common
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst all the terpenes is that they're
very volatile compounds, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they're not staying around on the
flour for very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the reasons why we're
smelling them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're continually being emitted from the
flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that a lot of your research has
been done on preserving the terpenes on
[SPEAKER_01]: the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we could talk a bit about the
strategies that you have come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ben, you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we mentioned before, terpenes are
responsible for the characteristic aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: and flavor of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because they're inherently
volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are constantly evaporating from
the cannabis plant, mixing with the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that provides us an opportunity to
smell them because they can access our
[SPEAKER_00]: olfactory receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a double-edged sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell amazing because they're
volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since they're volatile, they're
evaporating from flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that causes a relative reduction in
concentration of terpenes and flour over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple of parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should talk about associated with the
volatility of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, different terpenes are
going to have different relative
[SPEAKER_00]: volatilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller terpenes or monoterpenes are
more susceptible to loss over time as
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the larger terpenes,
sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a patient uses flour on day one,
they're going to have one terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may provide them with a certain
efficacy that they were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, not only is that profile going
to change due to loss of terpene content
[SPEAKER_00]: due to their inherent volatility,
but the overall terpene content is also
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the loss of product
quality is really exaggerated over time
[SPEAKER_00]: due to the volatility of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only product quality, but
potentially the efficacy of the flour may
[SPEAKER_00]: change towards treating different disease
states if we're changing the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, many monoterpenes are
associated with analgesic properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if those are the terpenes that are
evaporating first, you may not get that
[SPEAKER_00]: same pain relief from your cannabis flour
on day 30 as compared to day one after
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to try to understand
this from a scientific perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: About what is the rate of loss of these
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been some prior research done
on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Asholi, of course, was ahead of the
game and published a paper in the 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: describing a 45% loss of terpene content
in cannabis flour over a one-month storage
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty quick loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost half of your terpenes are gone over
one month.
[SPEAKER_00]: One month after purchase, pretty much of
your package product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also recently published a paper that
showed a similar result.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of the terpene content was lost after
four weeks of storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this rate of degradation does kind of
depend on a couple of factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental factors, including
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene profile, like I said,
if it's dominated by monoterpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're more susceptible to a faster
reduction in terpene content and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient's cadence of use of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fundamental reduction in terpene
content from cannabis flour comes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that terpenes are volatile and they
evaporate from the flour and they'll fill
[SPEAKER_00]: the headspace of the packaging that the
flour is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when a patient goes to use that flour,
they open up the container and the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes that are in the headspace are
lost in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how often the patient is using flour,
opening and closing that container will
[SPEAKER_00]: also affect the rate of degradation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would imagine the method of storage
would change that too, versus if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: it in a plastic bag versus a glass jar or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the permeability of these terpenes
through different media may affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like glass, you wouldn't expect
terpenes to penetrate that medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas certain plastics, they may be able
to penetrate over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I would agree with that
assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned temperature as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that one of the old school ways
of storing your cannabis was to throw it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a good strategy or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it depends on the
application that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about grower operators
looking to obtain a product such as live
[SPEAKER_00]: resin, which would mimic the phytochemical
composition of flour at the time of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, they do freeze that product
immediately after harvest to preserve that
[SPEAKER_00]: native terpene content at the time of
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that temperature is a critical
parameter in terpene evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hotter the temperature, the faster the
terpenes will evaporate and be lost from
[SPEAKER_00]: canvas flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, let's talk a bit about the
research that you've done and that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be sharing at CanMed 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about some novel technology that
you have developed to preserve and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: even reintroduce terpenes into flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're very excited at Goodness Growth
about our novel patent pending terp safe
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the origin of this product was when we
talked to cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that, you know, their biggest
fear is losing terpene content after
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can cultivate the most beautiful
cannabis flower with amazing aromas and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after harvest, they're susceptible to
terpene loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there are things you can do
with drying and curing that kind of reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a slower, lower dry will
preserve terpenes versus a hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: quick dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that can only get you so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's in the final package product,
kind of like what we talked about before,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes will evaporate from the flower
and be lost in the environment over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that in mind, we developed the
terp safe technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main principle behind it is if
your patients are or excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: if your listeners are familiar with the
maybe I'll take a step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main principle behind the terp safe
technology is the addition of external or
[SPEAKER_00]: exogenous terpenes to the packaging
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel that this is a meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel that this is one of the first
meaningful improvements to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging in some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the principle is based on Le
Chatelier's principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your listeners remember from general
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes are in an equilibrium as far
as the vapor stage or the solid stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the solid, solid stage terpenes are a
part of the cannabis flower and they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: equilibrium, evaporating and condensing
back on that cannabis flower over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the terp safe system, we're adding
additional vapor phase terpenes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: To drive terpenes back into that solid
phase of the cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a peer reviewed study, we showed
that we can maintain the native terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: content of cannabis flower for up to six
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are continuing to research this
technology and we hope to make additional
[SPEAKER_00]: claims in the future about longer storage
durations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only does this maintain the product
quality as far as the flavor and aroma of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, cannabis flower longer,
it should also provide a more reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy from dose to dose for cannabis
patients as we are providing a more
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable terpene profile and content
independent upon many factors that can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause variability in those two parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I understand correctly, then the
package itself is containing terpenes that
[SPEAKER_01]: aid in sort of keeping the terpenes in the
solid stage so that they stay on the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have to have the same terpene
profile in the package to match what the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower has?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it depends on what application
you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the basic applications for this
technology is to obtain a terpene extract
[SPEAKER_00]: that mimics the profile of your cannabis
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will preserve that terpene
profile longer as compared to a sample
[SPEAKER_00]: without terpsafe or control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another application that we're looking at
developing is tuning the terpene profile
[SPEAKER_00]: to achieve specific concentrations of
various terpenes for targeted disease
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would coincide with additional
research around terpene pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're really excited about that aspect
from a medicinal or that application from
[SPEAKER_00]: a medicinal aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that case, could you take sort of a
flower that's where a lot of the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: content has been evaporated off and then
sort of put it into this packaging and
[SPEAKER_01]: reintroduce some terpenes into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the experiments we
report in the peer reviewed paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rejuvenate cannabis flower that was
relatively depleted of terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the flower had about point one
percent terpene, so almost nonexistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, flower available for for
consumption has about one to three percent
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're an order of magnitude
below that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using terpsafe, we reinvigorated or
rejuvenated that terpene content upwards
[SPEAKER_00]: of one percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're achieving a terpene content
suitable for pulmonary delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now is there sort of a limit to the
amount of terpenes that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: reintroduce into a flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is there just so much that it will
that it will will take on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tune that value by the amount
of external terpenes added to the terpsafe
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found a linear relationship between
the amount of external terpenes introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: and the resulting terpene content of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would provide grower processors
with a application to obtain cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flower with a specific terpene content
based upon market and patient needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now what is the what is the size of
this packaging?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this more for, you know, wholesale
large batches or is this even down to like
[SPEAKER_01]: the individual packaging that a consumer
would would take home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have launched terpsafe nationally
through licensing our patent TV bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get that and we can get into that in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, the terpsafe system can be
used at any scale, packaging size,
[SPEAKER_00]: independent on on flower amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for our initial launch, we have an all
in one system where the terpsafe component
[SPEAKER_00]: is integrated directly into the cap of the
cannabis packaging jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the initial system is for three
point five grams of cannabis flower or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, a pretty common amount in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But future iterations will be independent
upon size simply for larger batches for a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower processor who wants to preserve
terpene content prior to packaging that
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just add a couple of these
terpsafe components to a larger amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get that same preservation that a
patient would experience in their three
[SPEAKER_00]: point five gram container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now how many different terpenes are
you able to to use in this system?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we mentioned that there are over
200.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many different ones are you able to
reintroduce or preserve?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found in our initial study that the
system was effective independent upon
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the rate of preservation or infusion
may vary based upon terpene utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that the mono terpenes are more
volatile, so they offer a higher infusion
[SPEAKER_00]: rate as compared to sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in principle, any terpene can be
utilized in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes terpenes derived from
botanical non-cannabis sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes extracted from cannabis plants
can be reintroduced to get that strain
[SPEAKER_00]: specific terpene profile preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even synthetic terpenes can be
utilized if the appropriate safety
[SPEAKER_00]: considerations are adhered to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's really that's really
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before, I know we're kind of wrapping up
here, but I did want to touch on just the
[SPEAKER_01]: difficulty of actually measuring terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that something that's come up in
conversations that I've had with others
[SPEAKER_01]: who are kind of in the analytical space or
the testing space.
[SPEAKER_01]: How difficult is it to test for terpene
specifically within the cannabis matrix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that one of the reasons why maybe not a
lot of labs are testing for it and why
[SPEAKER_01]: when we go to the dispensary, we don't
always see terpene content on packaging?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as with any botanically derived
samples, there's going to be an inherent
[SPEAKER_00]: heterogeneity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be variability across
cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even from the same location on
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned earlier in the talk,
there are numerous sources that can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: variability in terpene profile and terpene
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these include cultivation and grow
practices, how you're curing and drying
[SPEAKER_00]: your flower, genetic and numerous other
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of this, there is an inherent
heterogeneity of the sample that can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely cause difficulties providing an
accurate and precise terpene content when
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is that terpene analysis is
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a grow processor wants to do it
in-house, the equipment is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Headspace GC-MS is not cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need someone with some sort of
experience or skill to operate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, I found as we do
terpene analysis in-house that has
[SPEAKER_00]: supported some of this research we
discussed today, there's over 200 terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been identified in cannabis
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're analyzing for terpene
content, you're not going to quantitate
[SPEAKER_00]: all 200 of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be a lot of
potentially interfering compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're quite similar as far as many of
them are isomers of one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is that terpene analysis takes
a lot of time to interpret the data to get
[SPEAKER_00]: an accurate and precise result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a third party testing lab that has
to pay an analyst to do this, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a labor component that is
representative in what the charge for that
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a grower processor really has to weigh
if they want to spend that amount of money
[SPEAKER_00]: to determine terpene content, even though
most new patients are not familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: what a terpene even is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there any added value there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the USP cannabis expert panel
recommends the quantitation of five
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes for all cannabis flower products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think the industry has caught
up to that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, five is probably too minimal,
20 or more, maybe a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with further patient education and
maturity of the industry, hopefully we can
[SPEAKER_00]: improve this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may result in improved outcomes
for patients if they have more information
[SPEAKER_00]: to make their decisions on what cannabis
product to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a great point you make about
sort of the heterogeneity of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, that if you take one bud from
one section of the plant and compare it to
[SPEAKER_01]: another, they could have different
concentrations of these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you layer in the other
variables of time, how long has it been
[SPEAKER_01]: since that sample was analyzed until it
gets to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And could the chemo type of change between
then and now?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does make sense that your solution
here is going to create a much more
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent product so that people can get
some more reliable results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ben, you describe one of our main
applications for TerpSave, which is a more
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable terpene profile and terpene
content across the entire batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we envision batch to batch
reproducibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, different harvests,
if plants are grown in the winter versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer, may have different terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're exposed to different amount of
light, they'll have different terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these are factors that we can
reduce their impact on the variability of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profile of cannabis flower using
the TerpSave technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So winding down here, I did want to give
you an opportunity to share any additional
[SPEAKER_01]: information that you think the listeners
might be interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a website, social media
accounts, or some of the studies that you
[SPEAKER_01]: may have mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll jot down the notes and be sure to put
them in the show description so people can
[SPEAKER_01]: learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I appreciate that, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our peer-reviewed paper talking about
the science proof of concept and
[SPEAKER_00]: validation studies of TerpSave was
published in the Journal of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find our paper there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our website is terpsafe.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is T-E-R-P-S-A-F-E dot com.
