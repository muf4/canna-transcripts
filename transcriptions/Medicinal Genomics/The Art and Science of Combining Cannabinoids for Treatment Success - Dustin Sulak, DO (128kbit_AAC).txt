[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ethan, for a great opening
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait a moment for the slides to come
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this talk, which I alluded to yesterday
in some ways, kind of came out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that I had and that Bonnie also
shared that she had and some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: clinicians that have been doing this for a
while, where we started our career mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: working, career in cannabis, I should say,
mostly just working with THC with our
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a few years along came
another option to work with CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we could combine that with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another option came along.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discovered the acidic cannabinoids had
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of added those in, and then CBG
came along, and now there's some THCV and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can imagine that for a lot of people
just coming into this field, it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming because there's a lot of
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them have overlapping
therapeutic effects, therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see a certain patient with some
symptoms, and you wonder, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the heck do I start?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I wanted to do with this talk
was just bring in some basics from the
[SPEAKER_00]: preclinical and clinical literature to
show you what happens when we combine
[SPEAKER_00]: these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all in this room are aware that
their combinations are often superior to
[SPEAKER_00]: their isolated usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we approach it and make sense of
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for the folks in the back,
yesterday I had a full screen down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not essential, but it's a little
easier to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the next 28 minutes, what we'll go
through is just a little reminder like
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday about how complex this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about the major chemotypes,
acidic versus decarboxylated, the role of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemovars, I'll just mention that,
and then the types of interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the right column, here we're
going to go through all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations, some very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm really going to emphasize is the
THC plus CBD one, because I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: us bring a limited understanding of what
happens when we combine these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to go into some of those
nuances and give a more complete picture
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yesterday I talked about this is a
multi-compound, multi-targeted medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: that interfaces with the ECS.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's incredible complexity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have this tendency to want to
be reductionistic and to really understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening at what receptors,
that might help in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think what's more helpful is to kind
of zoom out and look at pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition and trends and what we're
seeing with our patients and also in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are four main chemotypes of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotype one is THC dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotype two has a relative balance of
THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three is CBD dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four, CBG dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some THCV-rich varieties of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that we have any that are
truly THCV dominant with very trace levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of the others yet, but I'm sure that's
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what I want to use as a
framework for thinking about when a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient comes in to see me, where am I
going to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with typically one of
these major chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within each one, there's this
question about is it in the acidic or raw
[SPEAKER_00]: state or is it decarboxylated,
which can be very different in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within these chemotypes,
of course, there's different chemovars,
[SPEAKER_00]: the different varieties that can have very
different properties, very distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way I see that in a lot of cases,
most of the time, is like the
[SPEAKER_00]: old-fashioned radio where you have the big
tuning knob to kind of find the station
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the little tuning knob to do the
fine tuning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider the chemotypes like the big
tuning and the chemovars the finer tuning
[SPEAKER_00]: to really dial it in to maximize the
benefits or minimize the adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to talk a lot about the
chemovars here, even though some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are very special and there can be highly
selective responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also a hard thing to accomplish
because the naming is all over the place
[SPEAKER_00]: and the consistency from one batch or one
store to the next is problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to focus on the
chemotypes, especially if you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: started here and even if you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the two main types of
interactions that we might be thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about here are the pharmacokinetic
interactions, which are interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: having to do with absorption, metabolism,
excretion, distribution, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacodynamics having to do with their
actual physiologic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, well, I'll apologize in advance it
looks like the formatting got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did correct it this morning,
but some of the images here are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a clear background instead of a white
one and I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of a PK interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a really interesting rodent study
where they compared blood levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids administered in a
full-spectrum extract with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities of those cannabinoids but
administered alone and they were given
[SPEAKER_00]: orally to mice in a single dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This full-spectrum extract, as you can see
here, it had a little bit of just about
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was around half decarboxylated or
somewhere in that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was CBD, CBDA, THC, THCA,
and CBDVA, CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they tested those six isolated
cannabinoids in the same quantity against
[SPEAKER_00]: the full extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found here, here's an
example with CBD and this is kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the light-colored line here we have the
purified CBD and in the dark we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same quantity of CBD in the context of the
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see there's much better absorption
with the purified CBD and the typical
[SPEAKER_00]: reason for that is that fat-soluble
compounds, when they're taken orally at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time, they compete with each
other for some absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this with fat-soluble vitamins and
other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they didn't expect was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have CBDA getting absorbed much
better in the context of the full extract
[SPEAKER_00]: than it did in the isolated form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 14 times higher area under the
curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the heck was going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did CBDA get absorbed so much better?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the diligent researchers, this was
Jonathan Arnold's group out of Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: they ended up figuring out that this had
to do with an efflux pump in the
[SPEAKER_00]: intestinal border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to orient you, I'll show it on
this slide here, we have the lumen of the
[SPEAKER_00]: intestine would be here and here's the
blood supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the cannabinoids get absorbed,
some of them are kicked back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: lumen through this efflux pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the researchers discovered was
that low amounts of CBG or THC would
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibit that BRCP efflux pump,
prevent the CBDA from getting kicked back
[SPEAKER_00]: out, and therefore increase the absorption
of CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this was in rodents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if this is exactly the case
in humans, but we do see very high levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBDA bioavailability when taken orally
in humans, so there's a high likelihood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, what would be the take home from
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be that if you're using CBDA,
it would probably be helpful to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little THC or a little CBG with it to
match and maximize the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's an example of a PK
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move on to the main topic here,
which is THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll start with kind of where we're
all coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a study of 177 patients with cancer
pain who were on opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were treated either with nebiximals,
the THC-CBD combination, or the same dose
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC, or the same basically spray method
of THC alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were allowed to titrate up to
however many sprays was effective without
[SPEAKER_00]: adverse effects, and then looked at the
levels of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out that the people who were
receiving the THC-CBD combo, they ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: using somewhat more sprays, not a lot,
but a little bit more sprays per day on
[SPEAKER_00]: average, and that's likely because it was
somewhat better tolerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you look at the results here,
so this first one is a 10% or greater
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in pain, and there's really no
difference in the proportion of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that achieve that between THC or
combination THC-CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is more clinically relevant,
30% reduction in pain or greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see quite a big difference
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 40% more of the people in the
THC-CBD group achieved that compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: THC alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the adverse effects in both groups
were similar because they were allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: titrate in the way that they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea here is that THC was
causing some side effects that limited the
[SPEAKER_00]: dose, and CBD was probably mitigating that
while adding some of its own benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what we tend to think
about with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add it to THC, you're gonna mitigate the
adverse effects, you're gonna enhance the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, it makes perfect sense,
let's put them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of times that's the
case, and it's certainly the case with the
[SPEAKER_00]: severe adverse effects this is showing
toxic psychosis threshold in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of THC taken orally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from a paper from Ethan in
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at just pure THC,
around 18 milligrams, that could cause
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic psychosis in some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's a temporary experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's combined with CBD,
you need a much higher dose to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: that severe adverse side effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a summary summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first slide I'm gonna keep coming back
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacodynamic interaction is that CBD is
a negative allosteric modulator at CB1,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can dampen the adverse effects,
especially the more severe ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's a study in fibromyalgia
patients who were vaporizing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: either type 1, type 2, or type 3,
or a placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were looking at their subjective
pain results after vaporization,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also at their blood levels of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was that CBD
inhalation increased the THC plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, but diminished the
analgesic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: These authors suggested this was a
synergistic pharmacokinetic interaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning the presence of the CBD slowed
down the metabolism of THC, allowing for
[SPEAKER_00]: there to be higher levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an antagonistic pharmacodynamic
interaction, those higher levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: did not result in better pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually resulted in less pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there were also reductions in
spontaneous pain in this study that
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated with the subjective rating of
drug high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that to help the pain in these
fibromyalgia patients, it seemed like
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching this psychoactive,
this THC effect is what was really helping
[SPEAKER_00]: them the most, and CBD diminishes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, beyond dampening and
adverse effects, can adding CBD to THC
[SPEAKER_00]: dampen the therapeutic effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in some cases, the answer is
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this pharmacokinetic
interaction where CBD could be increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: THC levels by slowing its metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's another study, and I apologize
again for the slides, THC versus a ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: of one to three THC CBD vaporized in
adults and in adolescents looking at their
[SPEAKER_00]: subjective experience after doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would correspond to about a
quarter of a typical joint, the dose of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, that they were getting eight
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was that the
combination of THC and CBD at this one to
[SPEAKER_00]: three ratio was no less psychoactive than
the equivalent dose of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD augmented THC levels again,
so it's that pharmacokinetic interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: slowing the breakdown of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But despite higher plasma levels of THC
and that combination treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stronger effects were not observed,
likely again due to that pharmacodynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the group that received the combination
had higher levels of THC but did not have
[SPEAKER_00]: more psychoactive effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's a study that was a
double-blind randomized controlled trial
[SPEAKER_00]: with 26 healthy cannabis users that were
vaporizing either THC combination,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC CBD or CBD or placebo, again,
and looking at their driving performance
[SPEAKER_00]: in the simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was that the group
that had THC dominant only, no CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were, this is their standard
deviation of lane position, basically how
[SPEAKER_00]: much are they swerving back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that deviation was 2.33 centimeters on
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination of THC and CBD actually
had a stronger deviation, and the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant vapor didn't change it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is the cutoff here,
2.4 centimeters is considered typical of a
[SPEAKER_00]: .05% blood alcohol concentration and is
thought to indicate clinically relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: driving impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, the same dose of THC
administered with CBD was more impairing,
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly more impairing than THC alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, and that was just at
the 40 to 100 minutes test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no change later on at 240 to 300
in any group.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drivers who consumed THC were
generally more aware that their driving
[SPEAKER_00]: was impaired, but the group that received
both had less anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also rated the drug effect as lower,
and they had higher ratings of confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive than THC alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these findings challenge the myth that
CBD can ameliorate the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: What seems to be happening here is that
CBD mitigated the THC-induced anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it tends to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe a little THC-induced anxiety is
a good thing if you're about to get behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so beyond decreasing the adverse
effects and decreasing the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, could the combination of THC and
CBD decrease the awareness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment or decrease the anxiety related
to impairment and therefore increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this study suggests that that's
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably not in everyone,
but there might be some settings in some
[SPEAKER_00]: patients where that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a strange study because it
involved a very high-doseable THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: taken orally in a brownie along with a
whole cocktail of other CYP drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to spend a lot of time on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the brownie either had 20 milligrams
of THC or 20 milligrams of THC and 640
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a 1 to 32 ratio of THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty strong brownies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people who received the
combination with this high-dose of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: were more impaired, and they rated the
experience as less pleasant than the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who received the 20 milligrams of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of you are probably surprised
by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking, well, if I overdose on
THC but I'm taking it with this massive
[SPEAKER_00]: dose of CBD, isn't that going to dampen
down the activity at the CB1 receptor and
[SPEAKER_00]: protect me from feeling too stoned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case, which was an unusual
study, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's hard to see on these line
graphs here is that the plasma levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and of 11-hydroxy-THC were much higher
in the group that had the brownie with the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD in it compared to the THC brownie
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's significant pharmacokinetic
synergism happening here, increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of THC and 11-hydroxy, which are
both psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, is there a
pharmacokinetic potential to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment at high doses when CBD and THC
are taken together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's an interesting study on some
young people with epilepsy treated in the
[SPEAKER_00]: UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a variety of treatments that
they could start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the CBD broad spectrum,
the CBD isolate, and the CBD, we could
[SPEAKER_00]: call it full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the study, they called it broad
spectrum plus THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those were the options for treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you can see this and follow
it along, only four of the 35 patients
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up starting off with this broad
spectrum plus THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much everyone started with either
CBD isolate or CBD broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it didn't work, they would move
on to a different treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where they ended up down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to summarize these results on
the next slide, in total of the 17 who
[SPEAKER_00]: tried THC, 16 responded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 13 of them tried CBD dominant,
no THC first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of everyone that responded,
responded to the THC treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them were also taking very high
doses of CBD at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in some it was and some it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But kind of a waste of time for many of
them starting with this CBD isolate and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD broad spectrum with zero THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I bring that up because in this
situation, what I'm suggesting is that low
[SPEAKER_00]: dose THC in many cases can add benefit to
high dose THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get a partial response with
high dose CBD, switching over to a full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum extract might be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I've got for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll summarize it again later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is, I hope that I've broadened
your mind a little bit about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: potentials for THC and CBD to interact
with each other, pharmacodynamically and
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacokinetically when taken via
inhalation and when taken orally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pharmacologically distinct from
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of beneficial properties,
anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective,
[SPEAKER_00]: hepatoprotective, anti-emetic,
very strong anti-emetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't think about that
with THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many other targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And THCA is different than THC,
especially because it doesn't act upon the
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least not as a partial agonist like THC
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do these two go together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have similar metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though this hasn't been shown
that I'm aware of in humans, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: likely going to be pharmacokinetic agonism
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take THCA with THC, it's likely to
slow the breakdown and could potentiate
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC pharmacokinetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also one study in rodents that
showed that THCA was acting as a CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: positive allosteric modulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is exciting because if this is
the case, a positive allosteric modulator
[SPEAKER_00]: at CB1 has great therapeutic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take THC as a CB1 agonist,
we are globally affecting our
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, which can be a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think affecting our endocannabinoid
system with greater precision,
[SPEAKER_00]: the precision involved with our
endocannabinoid synthesis, would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: in many cases, even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine if we could use something like
THCA to selectively enhance CB1 signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's happening, when and where it's
happening in the body based on the wisdom
[SPEAKER_00]: and precision of our own endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a lot of pharmaceutical
exploration looking for a good positive
[SPEAKER_00]: allosteric modulator for this reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cannabis tea is a great delivery
method for THCA, especially because the
[SPEAKER_00]: solubility of THCA is much greater in
water, especially if you're not adding
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like cream to the water,
you're going to have, at most,
[SPEAKER_00]: a one to five ratio of THC to THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a lot more THCA when you make
cannabis tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's switch gears to CBD plus CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: While THC and THCA are quite different,
CBD and CBDA are very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have many similar targets in the
body, but one of the main differences is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the CB1 receptor, so all that I
showed you about CBD interacting with THC
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacode dynamically dampening those
effects through negative allosteric
[SPEAKER_00]: modulation, this is not likely to happen
with CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA is also more bioavailable,
but CBD has greater ability to cross the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, what are the take homes from this?
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is also much more, excuse me,
CBDA is also much more potent than CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in many animal models,
like 10x the potency of CBD in a rodent
[SPEAKER_00]: model of Dravet syndrome, even though it
barely crosses the blood-brain barrier,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100x the potency of CBD in a model of
hyperalgesia, and 10,000 times the potency
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD in a rodent model of nausea
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, CBDA can be more bioavailable and more
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: These rodent studies don't rely on oral
absorption, they're intraperitoneal
[SPEAKER_00]: injection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, it really makes some sense to
combine CBDA with THC, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: people that do well with THC, and that
don't want the potential of dampening the
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic effects of the THC,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're avoiding that negative allosteric
modulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, CBDA and THC go really well together,
as demonstrated in this model of
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammatory pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the tiniest doses, I'm not gonna
get into it, that was my lecture last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, but if you see this study,
you wouldn't believe how low the doses
[SPEAKER_00]: were that were effective when combining
CBDA and THC for inflammatory pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, moving on to CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG has many mechanisms of action,
but one of them that I think is worth
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing up in this lecture is its
activity at the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This serotonin receptor is thought to be
the target of CBD and CBDA in its
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-anxiety and anti-nausea effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG has been shown to be a neutral
antagonist at this receptor, and could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially oppose some of the effects of
CBD, at least in one animal study,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was shown to oppose the anti-emetic
effects of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be unpredictable when
combined with other serotonin or tinergic
[SPEAKER_00]: agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a lot of this, but it's a
caution, maybe I've seen a couple cases
[SPEAKER_00]: now where CBG seems to have altered the
effects of CBD, but it's something just to
[SPEAKER_00]: watch for if you're using them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in most cases, they go really well
together, and remember, this is just one
[SPEAKER_00]: of their targets, one of many.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, CBG is also a PPAR-gamma
agonist with stronger affinity than THC or
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, and in VG, this was shown in animals,
where CBG could enhance, or the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG on this receptor were enhanced by CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think combining these two,
there's some potential for antagonism,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some potential for synergism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving on to THCV, this is a CB1
antagonist at low doses, a CB1 agonist at
[SPEAKER_00]: higher doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably most well known for
producing weight loss and decreasing body
[SPEAKER_00]: fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has anticonvulsant properties,
and it lacks the adverse effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: inverse agonists like remonabant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remonabant is a CB1 block, or the
anti-munchy drug that was marketed in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe and almost here in the U.S.,
but it makes people really upset and
[SPEAKER_00]: suicidal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a good idea to block CB1 in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCV can gently block CB1 and get some of
those same metabolic benefits without
[SPEAKER_00]: causing those types of adverse effects,
actually, it can be experienced as quite
[SPEAKER_00]: uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's usually, well, even when
administered as an isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a study that looked at a
very low dose of THCV in humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: five milligrams taken orally twice daily
for 13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It decreased fasting glucose, it increased
adiponectin, it improved beta cell
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were mild to moderate adverse
effects, but when the THCV was combined,
[SPEAKER_00]: combined with CBD, those metabolic
benefits vanished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when it was combined with a low dose
of CBD, they tested it both against five
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of CBD and 100 milligrams of
CBD, and those metabolic benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: vanished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very interesting that CBD may attenuate
or remove some of the benefits of THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's review all of this and then we'll
do a quick case.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and CBG may enhance the absorption of
CBD via the intestinal efflux pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and THC have pharmacokinetic agonism
and pharmacodynamic antagonism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that antagonism is good because
it's blocking the side effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it might not be good because
it's blocking the therapeutic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are complex cognitive and
subjective effects, including more
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence driving in that one study.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and CBD are similar and likely have
pharmacokinetic agonism and different
[SPEAKER_00]: potency and brain penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA and THC are distinct in their
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They likely synergize pharmacokinetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA may be a positive allosteric
modulator at CB1, which could enhance
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid function and enhance the
activity of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA and THC may have some synergistic
effects together in inflammatory pain with
[SPEAKER_00]: ultra-low oral doses and in general seems
to be a good combination for my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG can act synergistically with CBD via
PPAR gamma, may block some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: serotonergic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBG cannot replace THC or CBD,
but it adds distinct effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that when you're thinking what
should I do, switch or add, I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes the combination of all of them
can be useful, but we wouldn't start
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD can block the metabolic benefits of
THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my recommendations when you're
approaching a patient and you're thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: where do I start, work with full spectrum
chemo type categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think to yourself, am I going to start
with one, two, three, or four?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I coming out of the gates with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Try one at a time, explore dose response
effects, and then add or switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have kind of a starting dose,
you have a dose that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: titrate up to if there's no adverse
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see how they do within
that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Bonnie says, you're kind of ruling it
in or ruling it out, is this chemo type
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then depending on how far you get,
you can switch to something else or you
[SPEAKER_00]: can layer something else on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think that the combination of THC
and CBD, this type two, is a great place
[SPEAKER_00]: to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very effective, but if you're relying
on it to produce decreased psychoactivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: that may not be the outcome that you see
in everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly going to be that way in
some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Include at least a little THCA with your
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, don't fully decarb your THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to work better if you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The possible exception to that is in
people that need THC but are ultra
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive to it and you want to have a
more precise low dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Include at least a little CBDA with your
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work similarly and the CBDA is much
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Include at least a little THC or CBG with
your CBDA to enhance its absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Observe closely when you're adding CBDA or
CBG to CBD, you might not get what you
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And avoid CBD with THCV if you're looking
for the metabolic benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some general recommendations,
things to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give a quick case in the next
last minute here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So autism spectrum disorder, age five,
came in with nighttime awakenings,
[SPEAKER_00]: intermittent aggression and hand biting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started him on a balanced ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products that we work with that I get
the great pleasure of working with,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've designed and Healer makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our one to one, but it's
actually a one to one to one to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's half decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: One drop is one milligram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he started off with five drops in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little more than one milligram of
each of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I chose a formula called Healer
Pain at Night, which was a THC to THCA one
[SPEAKER_00]: to one formula for bedtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I chose that was really
because I wanted to incrementally adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: in half milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of full milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I came back one month later,
global improvement in all areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medicine has been a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in absolute awe of how it has changed
his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's even willing to try more foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had titrated up to 15 drops of balance
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost four milligrams of THC in that
dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten drops in the afternoon, two and a half
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain was four drops before bed,
so two milligrams before bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But four months later he had started
public school and his symptoms worsened.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had titrated up on the balance
formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were still exploring the dose
response curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went up on the balance and the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symptoms improved some, but he was still
pushing his peers, attempting to bite
[SPEAKER_00]: others, slapping himself in the face,
waking up at three or four in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was still making developmental
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we changed the nighttime formula to our
more sedating THC dominant Healer Night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started adding our CBG formula
during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started sleeping through the night,
squeezing or giving a little pinch instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of being more aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was stable at 25 and 20 drops of
balance in the morning and the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, so that's around almost six
milligrams of THC in the morning and five,
[SPEAKER_00]: not in the night, but in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG 10 milligrams twice daily,
night six milligrams before bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the efficacy was maintained for the
following six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that shows you a case where
here's what I decided to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balance during the day, THC dominant at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symptoms returned, I titrated up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get the results we were looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We layered in CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my next choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got the symptoms under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is all I have for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
