[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you all know, I work with a lot of
children with epilepsy and autism and is
[SPEAKER_00]: often the case with cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see all these significant improvements,
but yet these improvements are difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to measure objectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you may ask me, well, if a child's
doing well and the parents are happy and
[SPEAKER_00]: the school is happy, why do we need
objective measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of it goes to what Dr.
Meckler was just talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the ongoing skepticism within the
medical community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are still somewhat resistant to
patients using cannabis, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: children, still considered very
controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so, but many others do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing, too, is wouldn't it
be nice if somebody was spending $1,000 a
[SPEAKER_00]: month and seeing great benefits in their
child if that was covered by insurance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know, and I definitely see
this, that insurance companies are not
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in paying for this,
but I think we're saving the insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: companies a huge amount of money because
these kids have much lower health care
[SPEAKER_00]: utilization needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely see it in my pediatric
epilepsy practice where these children are
[SPEAKER_00]: not ending up in the ICU every other month
with status.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be nice if their insurance
companies would pay for some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: medications for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about my research in
using pharmacometabolomics and measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: salivary biomarkers to measure the impact
of medical cannabis in children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we all know about autism
spectrum disorder as being this
[SPEAKER_00]: heterogeneous condition with increasing
prevalence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now the CDC says one in 36 children.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 241% higher than what was reported
24 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's clear-cut evidence of inflammation
in both the gut and brain, and currently
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only two FDA-approved medications,
both antipsychotics, which have very
[SPEAKER_00]: serious short- and long-term side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an 11-year-old patient in my
practice who gained 40 pounds in about
[SPEAKER_00]: three months on an antipsychotic,
and so it didn't help his aggression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just made him bigger and stronger,
and that's not really desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're looking at really what are
the issues with autism, we talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: three core symptoms that are listed here
at the bottom, and no pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_00]: address these, so communication
difficulty, and I say in some because some
[SPEAKER_00]: people with autism communicate just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impaired reciprocal social interaction and
restricted repetitive and stereotype
[SPEAKER_00]: behaviors of pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know boys are more affected than girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know some of these patients have
very significant above-average
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence, but some have intellectual
disabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's numerous clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday I talked about this in the
medical practicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one particular review looked at 13
studies and what they found.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard for me to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four observational studies that showed
that 70 to 93% of participants had
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very high number, especially in
this refractory condition that somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: really doesn't have very many options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two retrospective reviews showed 61%
improvement rates and behaviors,
[SPEAKER_00]: 67% improvements in those core symptoms
which pharmaceuticals do not treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three studies show they're able to
decrease dosing or discontinue other
[SPEAKER_00]: medications, and all studies demonstrated
very acceptable safety and tolerability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have a slide on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about it I think yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears that children with autism have
an endocannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two studies, one from Israel and
one from Stanford University showing that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have lower levels of anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so remember what anandamide is
involved with is pretty much everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need in terms of regulating
emotional behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also endocannabinoids are involved in
immune function and we know that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of connection in terms of treating
this underlying likely endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: imbalances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've treated hundreds and hundreds of
children already who have autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have comorbidity with
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what the parents report,
and this is fairly routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not every patient, but many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less anxiety, and by the way, anxiety is a
number one condition that parents come in
[SPEAKER_00]: for with these kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just are so overly anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you I've actually met with
patients outside my building because they
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't come in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or go up the elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less aggression towards others and self,
better sleep, less rigidity, improve
[SPEAKER_00]: socialization, speech, communication,
better focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some patients do have some improvement in
the repetitive behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is that you can see
patients improve in certain areas and not
[SPEAKER_00]: in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm finding difficult to treat in
some of these kids are some kind of OCD
[SPEAKER_00]: hoarding behaviors, which are really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had to kind of really try other
things with those patients to figure it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the current approach is trial and
error, and don't let anybody tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start a patient on either a
combination CBD THC or a CBD dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The studies, mostly from Israel,
show that CBD dominant will treat about
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of your patients, and then you can
start tailoring it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone's aggressive or has severe
insomnia or severe anxiety, I'm always
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in using CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using some THC in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, the point being here is that
it's a really difficult process to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out these kids are all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's trial and error at best,
and it's based on parental feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is incredibly labor intensive for the
clinician and for the parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure parents keep notes because one
day can vary from the other, and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to just look over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many days were better and how many
days weren't better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's just a lot of variability
in the response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big question is, who might benefit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we pre-select who might benefit and
save people time and energy and resources?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, can we pre-select cannabinoids and
products, and how do we assess the outcome
[SPEAKER_00]: objectively?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this brings me to the research I'm
doing with a company called Canformatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of our papers are open source,
so there's three of them online.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just Google my name and put autism
research, you'll find the papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this technology uses
pharmacometabolomics, which is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: the systematic identification and
quantification of metabolites in an
[SPEAKER_00]: organism or biologic sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collect metabolites, which are
compounds that make up what we call the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just these compounds that
reflect chemical pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allow you to see what is happening in
the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks at phenotype versus genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do the DNA studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But DNA, remember, just gives you
predictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the gene isn't turned on, it's not
being expressed, it may not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: help you in determining how you should
treat a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're looking at the
metabolites, the metabolome, it tells you
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in that human right at the
moment that you're collecting that
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just the way that the samples
are collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do pharmacometabolomic or
metabolome testing really on any biofluid,
[SPEAKER_00]: any tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultured cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we do is we collect the
samples and we send it in for nuclear MRS
[SPEAKER_00]: or mass spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you look at your peaks and you
kind of scale your raw data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have reports that you can
generate, including heat maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you can put out pathway maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show you examples of
those as we go through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was the first paper we put
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was looking at the metabolites
that we collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go through how we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what we're looking at is
metabolites that reflect the pathways that
[SPEAKER_00]: are involved in inflammation,
bioenergetics, amino acid metabolism,
[SPEAKER_00]: neuronal activity, and the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to see, and really ultimately just
to make it simple, before cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we collect a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: After their dose, we collect a sample and
we see what changed, what moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it correlate with behavior?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had 15 children with autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are children who were all on stable
doses of medical cannabis customized
[SPEAKER_00]: through my care at least for one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we weren't changing anything so that
we could leave them on those stable doses
[SPEAKER_00]: for at least three months prior to the
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two saliva samples were collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't a swab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually had to spit into a tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it before they got their medical
cannabis dose in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anywhere from an hour and a half
to two hours after they got their medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis dose in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so about mid-morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, this was during COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started before COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got a little bit different during
COVID where we just had to be like on the
[SPEAKER_00]: phone with the family while they were
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did behavior surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we taught the parents how to do the
behavior surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did the survey at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the first saliva collection and the
second saliva collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a sample of nine children
typically developing no evidence of any
[SPEAKER_00]: neurologic issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: No medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just grabbed a saliva sample in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they established our physiologic range
which you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to show you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was kind of how we set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know what's in that physiologic
range?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the patients one through nine
who are neurotypically developing TD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's their average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we figured out standard
deviations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we decided for our study was that
greater than or less than four standard
[SPEAKER_00]: deviations away from the mean was
considered out of the range and
[SPEAKER_00]: significant and was actually correlated
with symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here, this is just
before cannabis and after cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just our hypothesis of what it
would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the characteristics of the
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to show you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started with age six because under six
is kind of hard to collect saliva.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed one ml of saliva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went up to age 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to minimize the effects of
puberty although we did see some effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of puberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see mostly boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how many doses a day that they
were taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one dose would be in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was three doses morning,
afternoon and evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just want to point out edibles and
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kids were all on tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was actually taking a gummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just we called it an edible if the
parents were putting it in food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see each child's cannabis
regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's nothing
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on their own response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working very hard with the family to try
to dial in using my rule it in or rule it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these kids it took two years
to find what worked for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember that during the time that
you're taking care of these patients new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to maybe introduce
something new after somebody's been on
[SPEAKER_00]: something for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's the behavior ratings before
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to cut to the chase red is severe
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighter colors are less severe and we
use three validated scales to assess this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parental ratings of symptoms before
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 11 of the children were severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: One child was moderate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two children were mild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually missed data on one of the
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that this improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleven children were considered much
improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two children had mixed response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So improved in some areas but not in
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two children actually had increased
difficulties at peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite possible that they were not
happy about having to give another saliva
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got again with the rigid behavior and
so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say everybody's allowed to have a
bad day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the behavior ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here is under this
improvement these are pretty high numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then no change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see on the end some actual
worsening for some of the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we detected 484 known metabolites
in the saliva.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 were identified as cannabis responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that we found that they moved
after the cannabis dose towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologic range in at least 8 to 15 of
the, in at least 8 of the participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: 31 of the metabolites were detected in all
the participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 21 exhibited statistically significant
shifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go just because time
wise I don't have that much time into how
[SPEAKER_00]: we calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are algorithms that are
explained in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just gave us a way to measure the
change and kind of sort out the z-scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here and I showed this yesterday I
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember now.
[SPEAKER_00]: N-acetyl aspartate which is one of the
most abundant neurochemicals in your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the second most abundant after
glutamate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found and there's already
research that exists that shows that
[SPEAKER_00]: N-acetyl aspartate which is involved in
neuronal function and density and can
[SPEAKER_00]: reflect neuronal dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular compound has already been
documented to be low in some individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: with autism or elevated in some
individuals with autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the elevation was associated more with
high functioning Asperger's type symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can see here, so these are
the patients along the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: A1, A2, A3, A5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just look at A2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So A2 had very high NAA prior to their
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see, after they took their
medical cannabis, is it is much lower and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's towards, this is the physiologic mean
here established by the typically
[SPEAKER_00]: developing groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here they're all kind of
tightly clustered around this average
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this gray line is the plus two or
minus two standard deviations away from
[SPEAKER_00]: the mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see though is that look at A3.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's basically no NAA measurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes up towards the mean when
it's high as you can see in the older
[SPEAKER_00]: kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all kind of had high NAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all came down towards the physiologic
mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some objective evidence of the
homeostatic nature of cannabinoids as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as shifting those compounds towards that
physiologic range that was established by
[SPEAKER_00]: the children who don't have autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really excited to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think that we would see such
great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I showed this yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't seen this, this is just
three of the older boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is plotted out, go on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your mean that goes down from the
arrow, the minus two to plus two in the
[SPEAKER_00]: green column.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the metabolites listed on
the left-hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see kind of how they're all
out of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after medical cannabis,
you see this is very crystal clear that
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening and what the parents are
reporting is we're seeing this incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: shift of these various metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember they reflect inflammation,
neuronal function.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're correcting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it seems to be a temporary correction
because if these kids are on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: around the clock or all the time,
why are they having this initial,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this was eight hours, at minimum of
eight hours without cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a temporary correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't ever want anybody to think
that, quote, we're curing patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think what we're doing is giving
them the natural nontoxic option to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: decent quality of life and to live in a
more physiologic balanced state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did was we decided to see
if machine learning could help us
[SPEAKER_00]: understand more about our findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a report that we published in
August 23.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a second report, which I'm not
including here, where we looked at just
[SPEAKER_00]: the lipid-based metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we took all this data and we
decided to see what machine learning could
[SPEAKER_00]: tell us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see three categories of children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had typically developing children
and their saliva metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had the category of children
before they took their cannabis and those
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the category of the same children
but the metabolites after their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had lots of metabolites to
look at, as you can see in the corner down
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at the correlation of
these metabolites in these categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of children with just the three of the
main cannabinoids, the other cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that you saw listed on that chart,
including THCA, CBDA, and CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just didn't have enough data and there
weren't enough children on those
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids to be able to assess it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did was we created
numerical scales for the dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, and it was somewhat
arbitrary, but we had to create some type
[SPEAKER_00]: of scaling so that we could feed the data
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here is the dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each dosing range got a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each behavioral response got a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was what we gave along with all
the metabolite data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can't include every finding,
but I'm going to highlight kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most exciting findings here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I'm starting kind of
backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what's in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, we looked at differentially
expressed non-cannabinoid plant
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found seven phytochemicals,
including flavone, rutin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rutin is a type of quercetin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitexin, which is apigenin, nerigenin,
zeaxanthin, corosolic acid, and
[SPEAKER_00]: cytosterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all associated with shifting
the cannabis responsive biomarkers from
[SPEAKER_00]: large standard deviations away from the
mean towards that physiologic mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these compounds have some
evidence of being acetylcholinesterase
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitors, which are involved in memory,
learning, attention, motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Mechler mentioned
acetylcholinesterase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found, though, and if you
look here, what you can see is this gray
[SPEAKER_00]: bar is pre, so this is just, you can see
that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before medical cannabis, this is
corosolic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the kids sat with their
metabolites for corosol acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second bar is after cannabis,
and the third one is in the children who
[SPEAKER_00]: don't take cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would it be there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, remember, it's a phytochemical,
so it's maybe in salad or some other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material that the child was taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But notice that none of the others here
were found in the typically developing
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point being that these compounds
were associated with improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hypothesized that this contributes
to the idea of the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's not just the cannabinoids,
it's also these plant compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: because these were found to stand out in
the patterns that were discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here, this Venn diagram documents the
identification of the autism
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-responsive biomarkers that
distinguish categories of the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so machine learning found one
particular compound that stood out to be
[SPEAKER_00]: different between the diagnosis of autism
and the children without autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one that's landing right
here in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here is that before
medical cannabis, it's this very wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variability, this wide range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with medical cannabis,
it corrects somewhat closer to the
[SPEAKER_00]: typically developing, but it never
achieves that kind of tight range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it seems that this particular
compound called Lyso-PE18-1 can
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguish between autism and basically
make the diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping to do further research on
this, because currently, as I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we know, there is no test for autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hoping that just by collecting
saliva, we might be able to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: support of the diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, remember, it's a clinical diagnosis
where you answer questions, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, the machine learning
documented that there was no evidence of
[SPEAKER_00]: any negative impact of cannabis,
that no biomarkers moved away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologic range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this may be due to the fact that all
of these patients were on cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that we knew were helping them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was already personalized data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suspect that if you were to get a
baseline before somebody started medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and you started some type of
regimen and then you checked the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites again, you actually might,
especially if you saw unwanted behaviors
[SPEAKER_00]: or worsening sleep or something like that,
we might see a shift away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologic range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole idea here is to try to
understand these metabolites and use them
[SPEAKER_00]: as a tool to follow treatment and design
regimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the last finding that I'm
gonna share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it's the most exciting,
is we discovered a number of biomarkers
[SPEAKER_00]: that were impacted by the specific
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is truly the understanding of
the mechanisms of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we understand which receptors,
which pathways CBD might affect,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have the information of the
underlying chemical status of the human
[SPEAKER_00]: being we're treating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making an assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this data can tell you about the
baseline characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, I'm just gonna share a
quick story.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents live in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dark most of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like not nice weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the doctor there, I had asked her to
check their vitamin D level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, well, we don't check those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just give everybody vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wouldn't you wanna know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everybody's shaking their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kinda know where you're starting and
where you're ending up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of how we practice
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So needless to say, we don't go to her
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But point being that I wanna know the
baseline chemistry and I wanna know what
[SPEAKER_00]: these cannabinoids are affecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very happy with the fact that when a
parent tells me the child is doing well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about the kids that I'm
struggling to treat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not everybody responds the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to understand their chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so THC we found was associated with 11
different cannabis responsive biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD was associated with seven cannabis
responsive biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really interesting, there was no
overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody who we've heard over and over
the past two days, THC plays a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important role.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people who are sensitive to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, if you are only using CBD
isolate, you are missing out on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these pathways and may not be achieving
that full treatment that the patient might
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG was associated with 15 cannabis
responsive biomarkers, more than THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three biomarkers overlapped between THC
and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG and only one overlap between CBD and
CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is there's been two
reports in the literature reporting that
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG may have a reside pharmacologically
between THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was Dr. Russo who mentioned
yesterday that CBG has overlapping effects
[SPEAKER_00]: with both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a lower dose, but it's not
impairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that gives you a nice tool to be
able to use in these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely see benefits with CBG in
these kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're treating kids with autism,
do not ignore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could start with CBD and THC,
but definitely try CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a fair amount of improvement in
speech, verbal abilities, and focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here, my research partners who
are brilliant say this is simplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's anything simple
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we combined the machine learning data
plus the information we gathered to create
[SPEAKER_00]: this metabolic pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And THC is in the green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it's strongly linked to
endocannabinoid metabolic pathways,
[SPEAKER_00]: including interacting with anandamide and
2AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG, which is in the mauve color,
was associated with 2AG arachidonic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: and ethanolamine, which is a phospholipid.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and CBG were also associated with a
variance of ethanolamine, which are also
[SPEAKER_00]: phospholipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those in the green with the
red border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD is in blue and was really
associated with numerous lipid-based
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways that are involved in influencing
oxidative stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up in the corner here, what you see,
it says ASD and depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is we found some
overlap in the scientific literature of
[SPEAKER_00]: these various compounds that changed quite
a bit in response to cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found some differences that were
also involved in depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how can we use these biomarkers so
we can use them, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: for diagnosis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this individual have the condition?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be predictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this patient benefit from medical
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you get back and you do a saliva
test before you treat and everything is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the optimal range?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a person that you necessarily need
to treat?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still always offer treatment if
there were issues, but at least it gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you that baseline status to have
expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predosing, which I'm going to show you a
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about dosing and cannabinoid profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should we pick first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Response, how well is the individual
responding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, what's the response over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it maintaining?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you that puberty really rocks
this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become much, for many of them,
they become much more aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more sleep issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be perfectly dialed in on their
cannabis and then they hit like 13 and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sudden it all falls apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always call kids moving targets in
the cannabis world because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly changing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here I want to just show you one last
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a perfect minute and 40 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the unhappy child that comes
into my office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is their heat map.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, red is symptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark blue is physiologically and the
light blue is optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this child really does not have
anything in the optimal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that red there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, you can look at this and
then when you repeat the test,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just compare the patient
individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we have a database, and here I have
another patient who has a very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: profile that's already being treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, I think they're happy over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that these, you get
correction shifting towards that
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologic range.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives us a chance to kind of dial in
treatment and not have to be so trial and
[SPEAKER_00]: error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not have to look for every cue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it gives us a chance to follow
these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to do more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This technology can be applied to,
we're looking at doing some research with
[SPEAKER_00]: some people in New York for dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to work with some people in
Canada to look at this for epilepsy as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ethan and I have talked about
using this to see if there's any metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in patients with CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a fair amount of application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this at least is, by the way,
you can send a kit to somebody's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can collect saliva and send it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's non-invasive and very easy and also
low cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
