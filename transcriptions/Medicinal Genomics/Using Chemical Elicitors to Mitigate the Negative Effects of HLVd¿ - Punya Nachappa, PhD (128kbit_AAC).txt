[SPEAKER_01]: Using potential chemical elicitors to kind
of, I guess, mitigate some of the negative
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of HLVD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please tell us more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chemical elicitors or synthetic
elicitors, also called plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators, as the name suggests,
it's a chemical that mimics plant
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's essentially giving the plants a
little boost to get their defenses going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not, you know, I didn't come
up with this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been using it in plant pathology and
in entomology research as a way to trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: plant defenses, give them a little boost
to get it activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also think of it as a way to
prime the plants and it can protect
[SPEAKER_00]: against diseases and pathogens because
naturally plant hormones or what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: phytohormones are doing this, but they're
doing it at a low level so that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the plant can devote all the
resources to the different functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to give it this boost so it can
get activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that I was interested in
this research is because cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: can be considered organic production
systems, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the repertoire of insecticides and
pesticides are so limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are only a handful of
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know their efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that these chemical
elicitors are actually registered for use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the reasons we were
interested in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our idea was to just boost the
plant's innate inherent immunity to better
[SPEAKER_00]: defend the viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was this prior to infection?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we didn't do it prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we infected the plant a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the plant going with the
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a week later, we sprayed these
elicitors and then sprayed every week for
[SPEAKER_00]: up to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then subsequently, I think at the
fourth or the fifth week, we took tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: and analyzed for HLVD levels using QPCS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let the plants go to flowering
and then did the cannabinoid analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we debated, should we do it spray
first, then infect or infect and then
[SPEAKER_00]: spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to do the former because we got
clones from infected plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were already infected,
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we figured that's probably more of
the natural situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are already infected.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what were the results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know this already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how it goes with research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never a perfect result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always more questions to be asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did two rounds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually getting ready to do a
third round.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results were mixed bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was, yes indeed,
a certain phytohormones or chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: elicitors reduced HLVD levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, they also increased the
biomass, the yield of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we were excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But go to look at the flower production
and cannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the major ones like CBD and THC was
actually reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you biomass, like almost 50% for
salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increased 50% compared to an infected
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're all infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the control was ethanol because that's
the solvent salicylic acid dissolved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In ethanol, the biomass per plant was 8.3
grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the salicylic acid spray,
it was like 15% or 15 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So almost double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these phytohormones also cause the
plants to cause cell division,
[SPEAKER_00]: delay senescence, and essentially giving
it better overall health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just picking salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all look pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other ones I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassinol, Brassinolide was 12.8 grams
compared to 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little less than 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pick salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, this is in micrograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC or THCA was 1,900 microgram per
gram in the control in ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in SA, it was 1,300 microgram per
gram, 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically 100% increase in biomass,
but a 30% decrease in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not so interesting because guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: After we did this, this was a two-year
study from 2022 and he graduated in fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fall, here comes a really nice study,
and I can talk about that, showing that in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact, higher levels, our goal was to cause
induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our aim of our study, because we were kind
of going blind, was we want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: these pathways in the plants, salicylic
acid or what have you, was turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went a little high on the dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a paper came out saying higher
dosage can reduce cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas the lower dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since that paper came out, now we've
got to fine-tune the rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so over-applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can reduce HLBD levels and biomass,
but does not have the same impact for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, which is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to fine-tune this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're redoing that experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already started and I should have
some new data for Canvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
Thank you.
