[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you everybody for joining us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry for the delay.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Jeff Chen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the director of the UCLA Cannabis
Research Initiative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really excited to be here and host Canimed
here at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually earned my medical degree and my
MBA both here at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm a Bruin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any Bruins in the audience?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got a bunch.
Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just a quick 30 second blurb about
what is the UCLA Cannabis Research
[SPEAKER_05]: Initiative.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started the program about a year ago
and it was through a generous gift from
[SPEAKER_05]: Terry and Jane Semel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our mission is to advance the
scientific understanding of the impacts of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis on body, brain, mind,
and society.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have 37 faculty members from
UCLA who've joined the initiative.
[SPEAKER_05]: It spans over 15 different departments and
six different schools here at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's an incredibly collaborative,
multidisciplinary effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today we're here to talk about
Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by 2050, it is estimated that one in
two seniors, when they pass, will suffer
[SPEAKER_05]: from some form of dementia.
[SPEAKER_05]: One in two.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Alzheimer's disease is the most common
form of dementia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we're here to talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to introduce our panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to my right here, we have Dr. Jamie
Cox.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the chief medical officer of Sundial
Growers, which is a cannabis producer in
[SPEAKER_05]: Alberta, Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Cox works with healthcare
organizations, universities, and industry
[SPEAKER_05]: partners to help them understand cannabis
as a viable medical treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has over two decades of senior
healthcare leadership roles, including his
[SPEAKER_05]: role as medical director of General
Motors.
[SPEAKER_05]: To my right, I also have Dr. Gary Smalls.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a professor of psychiatry at the UCLA
Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human
[SPEAKER_05]: Behavior.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's also the director of the UCLA
Longevity Center and the director of
[SPEAKER_05]: Geriatric Psychiatry.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's developed brain imaging technology
that can detect Alzheimer's years before
[SPEAKER_05]: symptoms start.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's also tested medications that can
delay the onset of Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's developed healthy aging lifestyle
and memory programs that are widely used
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scientific American Magazine named him the
world's top 50 innovators in science and
[SPEAKER_05]: technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's written the New York Times
bestselling book, The Memory Bible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, at the end of the table,
we have Dr. David Schubert.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is a professor and co-founder of the
neuroscience program at the Salk
[SPEAKER_05]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_05]: He established the first medicinal
chemistry lab at the Salk Institute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And his recent work has focused on
developing treatments for
[SPEAKER_05]: neurodegenerative disorders, including
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has developed synthetic derivatives of
natural plant compounds that have much
[SPEAKER_05]: improved properties over their natural
analogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's starting phase one human studies
for one of his drugs, J147, for
[SPEAKER_05]: Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's also been conducting drug screening
on various cannabinoid compounds to
[SPEAKER_05]: elucidate their neuroprotective properties
in Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please join me in a warm welcome for
our panelists today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think the first question to start
off with is maybe let's talk about the
[SPEAKER_05]: current state of evidence and state of
treatments for Alzheimer's in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: actually the progression of the disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: What treatments are available right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the side effects that we're
looking at?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I can start with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have several medicines that are called
symptomatic treatments, which means they
[SPEAKER_09]: help temporarily with the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't cure the disease.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't stop its progression.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've been around for several
decades.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're already directly marketed to
consumers.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've probably seen ads about them on
television.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we use them routinely.
[SPEAKER_09]: When patients have mild, moderate,
or severe Alzheimer's or other forms of
[SPEAKER_09]: dementia.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot of drug development and
other treatment development in trying to
[SPEAKER_09]: come up with what's often termed a disease
modifying treatment.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would mean that this treatment
would actually get into the brain and have
[SPEAKER_09]: an impact on either stopping the disease
or slowing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: One way to think about symptomatic
treatments is symptomatic versus disease
[SPEAKER_09]: modifying.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you had pneumonia, you would take
aspirin as a symptomatic treatment.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you'd have to take an antibiotic as a
disease modifying treatment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, more than 99% of the
disease modifying treatments have failed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or actually, all of them have failed thus
far.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're all looking for better approaches
to try to deal with this devastating
[SPEAKER_09]: illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd like to comment on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, yesterday it was well
demonstrated at the CME session,
[SPEAKER_02]: the neuroprotective benefits of the
various cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for us not to start looking at that
seriously, I believe, is a gross
[SPEAKER_02]: disservice to potentially half y'all in
the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one in two of us are going to get
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's up to us to start making a
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the old saying, keep doing what
you've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to keep getting what you've
got.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for us to make a change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm full on to the looking at the
cannabinoids in the proper perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like Dr. Small said, 99.9% failure
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very good, I wouldn't say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's try doing something slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe on that note, you mentioned
disease modifying agents.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the currently used
disease modifying agents?
[SPEAKER_05]: How effective are they?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the potential downsides?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, for Alzheimer's disease,
there are no disease modifying agents that
[SPEAKER_09]: are being used.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are several that are being studied
and tested.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's quite a few in development
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of them have focused on trying to
clear out the amyloid plaques that build
[SPEAKER_09]: up in the brain.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aloise Alzheimer defined the disease in
1906.
[SPEAKER_09]: When he did a brain autopsy study on a
middle aged woman who had the clinical
[SPEAKER_09]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he revealed to the medical community
for the first time abnormal protein
[SPEAKER_09]: deposits called neurofibrillary tangles
and amyloid plaques that collect in the
[SPEAKER_09]: centers of the brain that control thinking
and memory.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of the drug development has been
to try to clear out those plaques.
[SPEAKER_09]: That hasn't worked.
[SPEAKER_09]: At this point, they're trying to use those
treatments earlier in the course of the
[SPEAKER_09]: disease.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they'll look for families where there's
a genetic mutation and treat people who
[SPEAKER_09]: they know are going to get the disease as
a result of the mutation to try to prevent
[SPEAKER_09]: the disease.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I think that's progress.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of the research we're doing is
trying to target people before they have
[SPEAKER_09]: dementia.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a very slow, insidious,
gradually progressive condition that our
[SPEAKER_09]: studies and other studies have shown that
these abnormal protein deposits actually
[SPEAKER_09]: collect in the brain decades before people
have symptoms.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm a big fan of trying to protect a
healthy brain rather than trying to repair
[SPEAKER_09]: damage once it's extensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dr. Schubert, what are some of the
mechanisms through which cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_05]: might be able to have therapeutic
potential for some of the actual disease
[SPEAKER_05]: progression in Alzheimer's?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a tough question,
but I'd just sort of like to go back a
[SPEAKER_08]: step because I'm a big fan of plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we do have synthetic drugs,
which we're trying to get in the clinic.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of these are pretty, well,
long, at least in the preclinical stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you look at the history of drug
development, the majority of the drugs in
[SPEAKER_08]: the clinic today are based on plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the chemical scaffolds are
basically those from chemicals that derive
[SPEAKER_08]: from plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the problem with Alzheimer's,
as we realized a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_08]: or so maybe 10 years ago, is that this
amyloid idea was a very good idea to begin
[SPEAKER_08]: with in where you accumulate the plaques
and the tangles and whatever the initial
[SPEAKER_08]: description.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that may not be the only thing that's
going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we took an approach, and we did some
library screening of the collection of
[SPEAKER_08]: plant extracts and found some compounds
that work quite well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we developed a series of assays which,
remember, you know, we're trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: determine what happens in the old brain,
what happens in the aging brain,
[SPEAKER_08]: and then we screen compounds and try to
find ones that work, and then modify those
[SPEAKER_08]: so that they could make a better
pharmaceutical appropriate drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the question is, in the cannabinoid
field, how you would go about doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the plant itself, as you've
heard this morning, has a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: attributes, and probably a lot of things
are going on in what, when you are exposed
[SPEAKER_08]: to this plant, that you really don't
understand as far as the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_08]: potential.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think if you want to talk about
specific targets, I think that may be
[SPEAKER_08]: something of a mistake, because I don't
think you know what the target should be
[SPEAKER_08]: for Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have a couple ideas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, the cannabinoid receptors are
widely studied, but there's obviously some
[SPEAKER_08]: problems looking at directly at those,
so the idea has been to sort of take apart
[SPEAKER_08]: the plant and look at their 500 or so
unique chemicals in the plant and screen
[SPEAKER_08]: those in assays, which we have used to
identify potential therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what we're going to do,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I think it's probably not a
good idea to try to preselect a target.
[SPEAKER_08]: For this particular disease, because
you're looking at genetic-based targets
[SPEAKER_08]: and looking at preselected targets,
that sort of implies you know more about
[SPEAKER_08]: the disease and what you really do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So particularly with a lot of these
neurodegenerative diseases, this
[SPEAKER_08]: preselected target idea is probably not
good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we like to do sort of screening assays
without knowing the target and trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: find drugs that work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And can you clarify, when you're talking
about target, are you referring to a
[SPEAKER_05]: target drug to study or are you referring
to a target receptor in the body that you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to design a drug around?
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually when you're talking about drugs,
you're talking about a molecular target.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that means one molecule the drug
interacts with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what have you discovered as to the
properties of any cannabis-derived
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds that you've done in your lab
that might be relevant to
[SPEAKER_05]: neurodegenerative diseases?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what's unique about our lab,
I think, is the screening assays we use to
[SPEAKER_08]: pick up these activities.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're based on, as I said,
they're basing on aging things that happen
[SPEAKER_08]: in older brains.
[SPEAKER_08]: So age is the biggest risk factor for
Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people have known that for the last
100 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the drug discovery world has not
really paid much attention to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that's a big mistake.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you look at the cannabinoids,
in the context of what we've learned from
[SPEAKER_08]: our own work, I think there are a number
of pathways which are affected.
[SPEAKER_08]: Inflammation is a major component of most
neurodegenerative diseases.
[SPEAKER_08]: Systemic information contributes to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something which is sort of hidden
in the literature, but it's appreciated in
[SPEAKER_08]: the aging field, is this mTOR pathway,
which is an anti-aging pathway.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we found that our drugs affect this
very much like these anti-aging compounds,
[SPEAKER_08]: these so-called geroprotectors.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the cannabinoids actually influence
this pathway in a pretty profound way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that could be a target pathway,
but there's no really serious studies in
[SPEAKER_08]: the way of neurodegeneration in this
pathway, this target particularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned inflammation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned the mTOR pathway.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was also some work that your lab had
done, I believe, with THC and amyloid
[SPEAKER_05]: buildup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you speak briefly on that?
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of our drugs which should start
clinical trial approval next week,
[SPEAKER_08]: actually, it works in part by activating
one of those CB1 pathway.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this is indirect activation of
this pathway.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we know that these drugs clear out this
amyloid, which accumulates inside neurons
[SPEAKER_08]: in very early stages of Alzheimer's
disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've looked at like 10
non-psychoactive components of the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they also do very much the same thing,
CBD, CBG, CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one potential explanation of this,
these are anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we think that there's a structural,
we've been looking at the chemistry of
[SPEAKER_08]: these molecules, because we do medicinal
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're trying to figure out if there's
some structural motif which probably
[SPEAKER_08]: identifies a different type of receptor in
the brain tissue that can be engaged by
[SPEAKER_08]: these molecules.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're clearly not working
exclusively through the CB1, CB2,
[SPEAKER_08]: because we have one of our screening
assays use a cell, a nerve cell line that
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't have these receptors.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's something else going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've been talking a lot about the
underlying mechanisms that cause
[SPEAKER_05]: Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just touched on some of the underlying
mechanisms through which cannabinoids may
[SPEAKER_05]: have some therapeutic potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's shift gears a little bit,
maybe talked about, and you touched on
[SPEAKER_05]: this very briefly, Dr. Smalls,
is the symptoms of Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think anecdotally, there are folks
who are using cannabis to manage the
[SPEAKER_05]: symptoms of Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And is there any grounding in science for
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does the literature say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe let's start with talking about what
are some of those symptoms of Alzheimer's
[SPEAKER_05]: and how do we treat some of those symptoms
right now?
[SPEAKER_09]: So early on, when Alzheimer's strikes,
people generally develop memory issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they also can experience mood changes
and behavioral changes, social withdrawal,
[SPEAKER_09]: anxiety, depression, amongst other,
even years before the diagnosis is made.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there can be quite diverse mental
symptoms that present, although short-term
[SPEAKER_09]: memory seems to be the biggest complaint.
[SPEAKER_09]: As the condition progresses, there's
worsening of the memory problems.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's confusion.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are language difficulties.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's problems, of course, with paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are personality changes.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are visual spatial problems.
[SPEAKER_09]: So pretty much all areas of cognitive
functioning are affected.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you get further and further into
the disease, there is more and more
[SPEAKER_09]: emergence of behavioral symptoms,
aggression, psychotic symptoms,
[SPEAKER_09]: paranoia.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it can be quite difficult for
caregivers to manage that.
[SPEAKER_09]: The treatments are generally the
symptomatic medicines that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_09]: before, medicines like Denepazil,
Rivastigmine, and Mementane that are used
[SPEAKER_09]: to help with these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also try to counsel families on
dealing with the difficult behaviors along
[SPEAKER_09]: the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another approach that we've championed and
others have gotten behind this is to try
[SPEAKER_09]: to help people with their everyday
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot of compelling research
showing that genetics don't account for
[SPEAKER_09]: all the risk factors for developing
dementia.
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly, age is the greatest single risk
factor that was just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_09]: But people who are physically inactive,
people who don't get adequate sleep,
[SPEAKER_09]: individuals who are obese in midlife,
people who don't eat a healthy diet,
[SPEAKER_09]: who are stressed out chronically,
these are all risk factors for developing
[SPEAKER_09]: cognitive decline.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we try to help people with that as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to add another reality-based
issue that a lot of the senior population
[SPEAKER_02]: have, especially those afflicted with
early onset Alzheimer's, is the
[SPEAKER_02]: polypharmacy that we see berift in the
older population.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my prior roles was a medical
director at a large extended care
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the number of off-label drugs that are
used in the older population is really
[SPEAKER_02]: overtly concerning to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already dealing with a brain
disease, as Dr. Small has elucidated,
[SPEAKER_02]: with the inflammation which leads to the
Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add on top of that atypical
antipsychotics, benzodiazepines,
[SPEAKER_02]: neuroleptic medications, and then try to
function knowing that you've also got this
[SPEAKER_02]: coexisting condition that's creeping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Beers report is really
underutilized in the senior population,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we had a clearer focus on the
pharmaceuticals that are being used in
[SPEAKER_02]: this population and started weaning these
ineffective medications off, it would give
[SPEAKER_02]: us a much greater opportunity to actually
impact people's lives, which is what we as
[SPEAKER_02]: physicians are responsible to do,
improve quality of life, and do no harm.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can just expand on that a bit more.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another common problem is people take
over-the-counter medicines for sleep,
[SPEAKER_09]: or they take antihistamines that have an
anticholinergic effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that's important because one of the
neurotransmitter systems that gets into
[SPEAKER_09]: trouble in Alzheimer's is the cholinergic
system.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that will, and in fact several of the
drugs that have been developed and used
[SPEAKER_09]: for Alzheimer's are cholinergic drugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I mentioned, some of the behavioral
problems that emerge later in the disease,
[SPEAKER_09]: which generally lead caregivers to get
their family members into nursing homes
[SPEAKER_09]: and institutionalized facilities,
we don't have great treatments for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have these antipsychotics.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are narcotic drugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are black box warnings.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are problems with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes you use antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of research going on
right now looking for medicines that might
[SPEAKER_09]: calm people down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now there have been some studies using
marijuana products to treat that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the results are a bit mixed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes they cause side effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes they seem to calm patients down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what are some of the, you mentioned
black box warnings for some of these
[SPEAKER_05]: medicines and kind of describe what that
is and what are some of the risks
[SPEAKER_05]: associated with these medicines used.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are antipsychotics, typical and
atypical antipsychotics that can increase
[SPEAKER_09]: the risk of a stroke or increase the risk
of diabetes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's been a lot of concern about
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So doctors try to, even though they can be
quite effective when patients are
[SPEAKER_09]: psychotic and aggressive, we're concerned
about the side effects from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other issue with that is the use
of atypical antipsychotics in this
[SPEAKER_02]: population is not meant to be chronic use
of the pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's aggressive behavior or
psychotic behavior, it's supposed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: used at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's supposed to be weaned off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I've seen about 60% of some
senior populations in extended care
[SPEAKER_02]: they're on atypical antipsychotics until
they're done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually there's no drug right now
that's been approved to treat the
[SPEAKER_09]: psychosis associated with dementia.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are several compounds that are in
development that might succeed,
[SPEAKER_09]: but we have nothing right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in terms of, you mentioned some of
these clinical trials of cannabis or THC
[SPEAKER_05]: and that sometimes they're associated with
side effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the biggest concerns and
risks for the use of cannabis or cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: products in Alzheimer's patients?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if patients get overly sedated,
they can fall and hurt themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know that with dementia,
people often have unsteady gait,
[SPEAKER_09]: so that could be compounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: They will become more withdrawn,
which is a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: A big issue I see is people, widowed
individuals living alone at home,
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're completely isolated,
so they can't deal with their daily
[SPEAKER_09]: activities.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not always safe in the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can wander off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they're using cannabis,
it could make those symptoms even worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's why the need for study is
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be embarking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fortunate enough in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am from Canada, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are fortunate enough in some
provinces to have a policy on use of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids in extended care.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're actually going to be embarking on
a formalized trial, not using high THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: but rather a higher CBD, which has a more
satisfactory side effect profile in the
[SPEAKER_02]: elderly population to see if we can truly
impact the anxiety and aggression that can
[SPEAKER_02]: be seen in this population.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so maybe speaking to that,
because medical cannabis has been more
[SPEAKER_05]: widely used and regulated in Canada,
what is the current state?
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned there's certain extended
care facilities that have lenient cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: policies.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that landscape look like right
now for the use in extended care or memory
[SPEAKER_05]: care facilities in Canada?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really evolutionary, to be quite
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The policy in the province of Saskatchewan
was guidance policy on the use of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, cannabis is not used in
extended care facilities in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still considered to be a locked drug,
the same thing as a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has to go through significant
protocols to be even able to be used,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say on the floor by the nursing staff
to dispense it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're focusing on Saskatchewan
first, because they've already got an
[SPEAKER_02]: accepted policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the goal is certainly in no way,
shape, or form to create any sense of an
[SPEAKER_02]: individual being stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about trying to win and improve their
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ideal scenario would be to see some
people wake up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, from the polypharmacy,
it's barifed out there, folks,
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've been talking a bit about the
symptomatic management.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to almost bring the conversation
back to some of the underlying mechanisms
[SPEAKER_05]: that might target the disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dr. Schubert, one question I had for
you is you mentioned how traditionally you
[SPEAKER_05]: take natural compounds and then you
develop analogs, so things that look
[SPEAKER_05]: similar, but you modify them slightly to
improve various attributes of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what are your thoughts as to where you
want to go with your cannabinoid work?
[SPEAKER_05]: You've mentioned these various
phyto-cannabinoids you've been working
[SPEAKER_05]: with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I can first off of these should
define the problem, because the problem is
[SPEAKER_08]: we've initially, 10, 15 years ago,
started working with natural products and
[SPEAKER_08]: tried to use these in a therapeutic,
you know, context of helping with
[SPEAKER_08]: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, these types of
diseases.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the problem with natural products is
it's basically from a pharmaceutical point
[SPEAKER_08]: of view, they're dead end because nobody's
going to support a clinical trial for
[SPEAKER_08]: something and go down to Walmart or
someplace and buy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we work for many years and we have
natural products, which we think,
[SPEAKER_08]: and other people like, people like Greg
Cole here has been working on curcumin at
[SPEAKER_08]: UCLA for years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just extremely difficult to get a
natural product into a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people in the cannabinoid field are
going to, you know, there are ways of
[SPEAKER_08]: getting around that, but, you know,
the clinical trials for Alzheimer's are
[SPEAKER_08]: extremely expensive and difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so somebody has to make money on it
the way the government, the United States,
[SPEAKER_08]: or the world set up in order to get
something into the clinic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the only way we could get the compounds
that we really thought were helpful into
[SPEAKER_08]: the clinic was by making synthetic
patentable derivatives of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then even with that in the Alzheimer's
field, it's been very difficult to,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, get funding for the clinical
trials and for the preclinical
[SPEAKER_08]: development.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that may change.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more money in the Alzheimer's
field now than there was a couple of years
[SPEAKER_08]: ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but the rationale for doing the
clinical medicinal chemistry is to make
[SPEAKER_08]: the drug more potent and more
bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are problems with natural
products in the sense that there's some
[SPEAKER_08]: chemical issues that the medicinal
chemists don't like.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we felt in order to survive as a
lab and, you know, try to move things
[SPEAKER_08]: towards the clinic, we just had to do the
medicinal chemistry to get things moving.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there are going to be issues
in the cannabinoid field of the same
[SPEAKER_08]: problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you can organize it and learn from
what people in the past working on natural
[SPEAKER_08]: products have learned.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's going to be, I think,
a little bit difficult.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you mentioned curcumin.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we just published a study
using a bioavailable form of curcumin
[SPEAKER_09]: that's manufactured by a Japanese company.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we studied people not with dementia,
but people at risk for dementia.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they had what's often called mild
cognitive impairment or even just normal
[SPEAKER_09]: aging.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we studied them for 18 months.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we compared the compound to placebo.
[SPEAKER_09]: And curcumin is a component of turmeric.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's basically a spice that's been
around for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it reminds me a bit about of cannabis
because it ticks all the boxes in terms of
[SPEAKER_09]: effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's antioxidant, anti-amyloid,
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we had, even though it was a
relatively small study, it had a fairly
[SPEAKER_09]: robust effect on memory and attention.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're going to be following that up
with a larger study to confirm the
[SPEAKER_09]: results.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think this offers a model for
testing cannabis products that have the
[SPEAKER_09]: right balance of ingredients.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you don't have the mental effects that
might be problematic.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you have the effects on inflammation
and oxidation and even possibly amyloid
[SPEAKER_09]: buildup.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you test it in people not with
dementia, but people who are at risk for
[SPEAKER_09]: it earlier in the stage of their
neurodegeneration.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you can go back a little bit even
further than that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's this concept which has been
around for 100 years and recently been
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of revamped by the Aging Institute,
NIH.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Buck Institute up in Northern
California is the idea of something called
[SPEAKER_08]: geroprotectors.
[SPEAKER_08]: And geroprotectors are the idea is if you
can find compounds which maybe extend life
[SPEAKER_08]: in model organisms and extrapolate that to
humans.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you extend the lifespan a little
bit, you'll forestall the advent of these
[SPEAKER_08]: age-associated diseases like Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it turns out we've looked at a lot
of the pathways involved with curcumin and
[SPEAKER_08]: our drugs which are derivative of curcumin
and other sort of known geroprotectors.
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, caloric restriction is a,
you know, it's obvious what that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And two others are metformin which is an
anti-diabetic drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has other uses too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And rapamycin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it turns out that all these drugs
have, or these compounds in caloric
[SPEAKER_08]: restriction have the same molecular
pathways which lead in model organisms to
[SPEAKER_08]: life extension.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when I just, this weekend I was
looking at what's happening in the CBD THC
[SPEAKER_08]: field and it turns out these compounds are
affecting, they send the same pathways as
[SPEAKER_08]: curcumin and some of the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And our curcumin derivatives.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there's this opportunity for
the cannabinoid field is since these drugs
[SPEAKER_08]: are, most of the cannabinoids are
anti-inflammatory is sort of, even before
[SPEAKER_08]: you have like mild cognitive impairment or
whatever in the Alzheimer's world,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, there's some long-term
geroprotector.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this really hasn't been looked at
as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the cannabinoid field, but I think
this is a potential, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: use for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think eventually that may be
the case.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the challenges though in doing
human studies, if you start very early and
[SPEAKER_09]: very young people, you might be able to
have a signal on a biomarker, but to see a
[SPEAKER_09]: clinical signal is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it isn't until you get people with
what we call normal aging, which would be
[SPEAKER_09]: the precursor to MCI or mild cognitive
impairment, which would be the precursor
[SPEAKER_09]: to dementia, in normal aging, you are able
to see neuropsychological tests that are
[SPEAKER_09]: quite sensitive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can see changes when you test
compounds like curcumin.
[SPEAKER_09]: With metformin, there is a large study
right now looking at lots of aging
[SPEAKER_09]: targets.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: But let me also add another point.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you talk about going in earlier,
we and others have studied what the brain
[SPEAKER_09]: looks like late in life.
[SPEAKER_09]: In people who are heavy marijuana users
early in life.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not a pretty picture.
[SPEAKER_09]: It turns out that you have atrophy or
shrinkage of the medial temporal cortex,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is an important area of memory
consolidation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, when we talk about any kind
of medication or plant or supplement,
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever it is, it's really, you got to
take timing into consideration and dosage
[SPEAKER_09]: in the contents of the compound to
optimize the therapeutic effects and
[SPEAKER_09]: minimize any adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you brought up a great point about
potential confounding factors as to timing
[SPEAKER_05]: and onset, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of concern about the use of
cannabis with developing brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: One area that I had a question on is
there's been some work on the aged brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is in animal studies that on the aged
brain, and the impacts of THC on memory
[SPEAKER_05]: and even neurogenesis on the aged brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if any of you guys are
familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard very anecdotal commentary on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess we're in a unique position in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go a little bit tangent,
but I'll come back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is legalized in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the choice of whether to use cannabis
or not is now left to the individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: We as individuals in the space of having
the ability to do some research,
[SPEAKER_02]: to share our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anecdotal is a funny word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Russo yesterday showed a slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who weren't there, it was
fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was 1,400 people self-reporting how
they were doing on traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceuticals, which were clinically
approved, randomized, trialed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they weren't doing very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people were using cannabis to treat
their symptoms, and they found it superior
[SPEAKER_02]: to traditional pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to happen in Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for us to be able to look at it a
little bit differently, and look at,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Canada, we've got the reality,
like I said, it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's make sure that we have
information that we can provide to our
[SPEAKER_02]: aging population.
[SPEAKER_02]: In North America, we're all getting older.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not getting younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if we focus more on a holistic
approach, and actually identify an outcome
[SPEAKER_02]: based on how an individual is doing,
I think that may be a slightly different
[SPEAKER_02]: slant on the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: The horse is already out of the barn in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be able to take a long, multi-million
dollar research funded grant that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to take five years to demonstrate that
level of outcome, I don't think it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: To Dr. Schubert's point, it's very
expensive to do a lot of research in the
[SPEAKER_02]: lab, whereby only 5% of any research in
the lab is ever commercialized.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stays in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have to be nimble in this new
environment, and perhaps think a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just to reiterate, I think what Dr.
Cox is saying is that you have the
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity to almost reverse translate
findings.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, translation is where you go from
animal studies to human studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, we have an opportunity to reverse
translate findings, where we learn from
[SPEAKER_05]: the anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't take it for face value,
but based on that, we try to maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: engineer the animal studies or the
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know what right questions to ask to
actually test whether or not this is a
[SPEAKER_05]: real effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think it's important to really
demonstrate effective analytics of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're looking at thousands of people
with all variables not controlled,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like everyone in the room,
we're all different physiologically.
[SPEAKER_02]: The unique thing, and I've seen 3,000
patients for referral for cannabis use for
[SPEAKER_02]: primary care and specialist, is it's
interesting that everyone uses the same
[SPEAKER_02]: mantra when we're talking about treatment
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And gradually up titrate to effective
dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're looking at some of the
pharmaceuticals that are currently
[SPEAKER_02]: available, there's no ability to micro
titrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a capsule that's 300
milligrams, guess what you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get?
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the education gap that we have within
the physician community needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: narrowed, but we have an opportunity as
clinicians to do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with our remaining time, I'd like to
open it up for questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to shed a little light on this
from a physician standpoint in northern
[SPEAKER_10]: California, where we're using residential
care facilities for the elderly as a place
[SPEAKER_10]: for cannabis use in dementia care.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are more than one regularly using
cannabis on a two, three-time daily basis.
[SPEAKER_10]: We usually start at about 10 milligrams of
THC and 10 milligrams of CBD per dose.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go down sometimes, but usually
that's a starting dose.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll knock elderly demented patients down
for a couple days, and then they get up
[SPEAKER_10]: and behave much differently with a marked
reduction in their agitated behaviors.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can use the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation
Index as a scale to watch these changes,
[SPEAKER_10]: and they're doing quite well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Families are reporting some improvement in
cognition.
[SPEAKER_10]: Overall, the patients are happier,
the families are happier, and the staff is
[SPEAKER_10]: much happier.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, this is going on at this time.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are not IRB-approved studies.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are people in institutions whose
families want cannabis used, and under
[SPEAKER_10]: California law, we're able to do this for
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I would hope to put some light on this
as far as what we are already doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the doses have to go up very high
in order to cover the needs for these
[SPEAKER_10]: agitated patients, up to 30 milligrams of
THC and CBD per dose in order to control
[SPEAKER_10]: some of these very, very agitated
behaviors.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not only helping the agitated
behaviors, it's helping the pain,
[SPEAKER_10]: the insomnia, and many other aspects of
these elderly patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, could I just clarify that?
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you give them a dose of 10 milligrams
THC plus 10 milligrams CBD one time?
[SPEAKER_10]: Per dose, correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you have a sustained effect after
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: When do you re-dose them?
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually, they get a dose first thing in
the morning, again, sundowning at about 3
[SPEAKER_10]: p.m.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's a daily dose you use?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not a divided dose.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a per dose.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we may go, it's two or three times
daily in this patient population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and one of the elements of that just
to add on that, because of the duration
[SPEAKER_02]: that it takes for the cannabinoids to get
on board when you take it orally,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the bioavailability is significantly
impaired as well, as we move forward with
[SPEAKER_02]: different delivery mechanisms,
you know, we talk about the mucosal oral
[SPEAKER_02]: absorption, but there's other routes as
well, be it nasal sprays, for the more
[SPEAKER_02]: quicker onset of action, it's going to
give us an ability to titrate throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: aggressive behavior in a slightly
different way as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is true, and we are able to use oral
doses as a PRN order as well in this
[SPEAKER_10]: patient population for agitation and
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just in the interest of time,
I know there's about six people standing
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, I just remind us, we'll keep the
questions to questions, and keep them
[SPEAKER_05]: brief, because we only have 10 minutes,
and there's six questions we have to get
[SPEAKER_05]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for everything that you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you familiar with Dr. Chow at
University of Florida's work on Hyalolox?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's using THC, curcumin, and melatonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a treatment for Alzheimer's,
and I agree with Dr. Jeff, my mom with
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's uses cannabis as well as
another friend, same dose roughly,
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 CBD, seven THC, three times a day,
and helps remarkably.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not familiar with that word.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there are some animal rodent studies
in transgenic mice on combination of CBD
[SPEAKER_08]: and THC, and also with, I think,
THC and CBD alone, and there's some
[SPEAKER_08]: variation in the results, and so I can't,
I won't say anything specific,
[SPEAKER_08]: but in general, there seems to be an
improvement.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tends to agree with what we've found in
simpler systems, actually, and there is a
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty high-end paper in, I believe,
Nature Medicine, a year or so ago,
[SPEAKER_08]: showing that THC, when put directly into
the brain, has a positive effect on memory
[SPEAKER_08]: in older animals, so there is mounting
scientific evidence that these compounds
[SPEAKER_08]: actually have an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's a great documentary called
Prescribed Grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might be familiar with it,
about this population in Israel.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think what you've got to distinguish
is, are these things working, do you need
[SPEAKER_08]: the psychoactive component or not?
[SPEAKER_08]: And my feeling is, in the way we've looked
at it, you really don't for the things
[SPEAKER_08]: that we look at, and so I think the
emphasis should be maybe on some other
[SPEAKER_08]: compounds, the CBD, plus maybe other
compounds in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do more research.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna, and again, we got eight
minutes, we got four more questions to go
[SPEAKER_05]: through, so please keep your questions to
questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was just curious if any of you
guys, especially at UCLA, or in general,
[SPEAKER_07]: know of collaboration with Dr. Bredesen's
work on his kind of root cause approach to
[SPEAKER_07]: Alzheimer's prevention and treatment,
and using the anticanabinoid or
[SPEAKER_07]: phyto-canabinoids in collaboration with
him at all?
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't been collaborating with him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, more of a comment, too,
from Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a cannabinoid physician, and
specifically, I do see a lot of patients
[SPEAKER_06]: in long-term care setting, and just to
your point, we are seeing some real
[SPEAKER_06]: efficacy with reducing responsive
behaviors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally, the dosing we're seeing is one
part THC, four parts CBD for most of the
[SPEAKER_06]: oils we're using, and it's really
interesting, because in Ontario,
[SPEAKER_06]: again, we can do these, we have these
anecdotal evidence, but antipsychotics
[SPEAKER_06]: without a diagnosis is a reportable
outcome for the government when they do
[SPEAKER_06]: inspections of long-term care.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're really utilizing it to reduce our
antipsychotics in that setting,
[SPEAKER_06]: A, because the government's mandating it,
and B, we're having success doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sunnybrook, there's a study going on there
using Nabalone, and that'll be the first
[SPEAKER_06]: randomized control trial study,
and the evidence shows that they had some
[SPEAKER_06]: efficacy with Nabalone, reducing
responsive behaviors with dementia.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a new one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's published, but that
data was presented at a conference in
[SPEAKER_06]: Chicago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going back to Dr. Smalley.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you made a comment about the
shrinkage that can occur with prolonged
[SPEAKER_01]: use of cannabis, specifically in
adolescents.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, are there isolated studies
where we know that that's occurring based
[SPEAKER_01]: on cannabis usage as opposed to maybe also
alcohol playing a role in that?
[SPEAKER_09]: So did I see you at Woodstock?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to... No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you bring up a point.
[SPEAKER_09]: There could be some related behaviors that
could have contributed to that,
[SPEAKER_09]: and those studies didn't show shrinkage in
adolescents.
[SPEAKER_09]: It showed shrinkage when those adolescents
were older.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there could be confounding variables,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've come across.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we try to control for them in the
studies, but it's never 100%.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you're doing a prospective
randomized controlled trial, it's often
[SPEAKER_09]: very difficult to tease out those
confounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to even catch an effect like that in
any sort of clinical trial... I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_05]: To catch an effect like that in any sort
of clinical trial, the follow-up would
[SPEAKER_05]: have to be quite long.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the way it's done... Yeah,
it would have to be quite long.
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that study was done, they
recruited people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you been a heavy marijuana user in
the past?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how they did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the issue with that is what are they
using?
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 2%?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 15%?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 20%?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it contaminated?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have secondary pesticides?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem with a lot of the
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: The studies that came out of the US,
no disrespect intended.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to work here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the studies aren't legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say, okay, people are using this.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they don't know what they're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can you have a clinical outcome
based on what you don't even know what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any studies on the horizon that
you guys know of that will get more
[SPEAKER_01]: specific?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, first of all, I wouldn't say that
the studies are not legit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say it's a different kind of
study.
[SPEAKER_09]: How compelling the evidence is depends on
the design.
[SPEAKER_09]: So usually when these studies are
published in peer-reviewed referee
[SPEAKER_09]: journals, the referees look at all those
details to try so that how they're
[SPEAKER_09]: interpreted is it's done in a fair manner.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would say that a randomized
controlled trial, usually if it's done
[SPEAKER_09]: well, gives you more compelling evidence
in terms of cause and effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's probably more for Dr. Schubert
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I represent Dr. Raphael Mishulam and that
first introspection intro presentation
[SPEAKER_03]: that he went through was talking about how
we've been able to stabilize the acids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you get closer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I represent Dr. Raphael Mishulam's
company and what we've been able to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with Raphael is stabilize the acids and
then create the synthetic derivatives of
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were mentioning that that's
certainly a path that you've been taking
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'd like to hear voices around that
versus the actual natural plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm familiar with his work but I didn't
quite understand the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is you're obviously going
through the synthetic option, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: something that we're pursuing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean this is the, for us it's very
difficult to do anything but that because
[SPEAKER_08]: we don't have the facilities or the means
to do any clinical trials and considering
[SPEAKER_08]: how difficult it is to do, to work with
natural products and get any leverage as
[SPEAKER_08]: far as interest in it, it's in some sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean Alzheimer's is a particularly
difficult field so that's what we're
[SPEAKER_08]: doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The goal is to try to find a natural,
some components in the marijuana plant
[SPEAKER_08]: that are effective and we have to test
these animal models and if they look good
[SPEAKER_08]: then we can modify them chemically to be
able to make them into better compounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the metabolism of the
cannabinoids is tricky.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean they break down quite readily.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: So from the chemistry point of view,
there are ways to improve these compounds
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's what we have done and that's
where we're focusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you been working with the actual
acids as such or just the molecules of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just, we've actually just starting
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just applied for an NIH grant,
tried to work on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've done some work with stuff we can
buy, chemicals, cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can purchase but we're just starting
the work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Dustin Sulek.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an osteopathic physician.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been practicing cannabinoid medicine
in Maine for the last nine years and one
[SPEAKER_04]: thing that we often see in cannabinoid
medicine is a failure of clinical trials
[SPEAKER_04]: to be well informed by those of us on the
front lines with clinical experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really glad that you brought up
this topic of kind of reverse translation
[SPEAKER_04]: and my question to the panelists is how
can you inform yourselves on what's
[SPEAKER_04]: happening in the world of cannabinoid
medicine on the front lines so that you
[SPEAKER_04]: get better efficacy and results in your
trials and develop medicines that are more
[SPEAKER_04]: likely to help people.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, in my practice I find like
Dr. Hergenrather that THC is extremely
[SPEAKER_04]: important and effective at sparing
antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and other
[SPEAKER_04]: beers list medicines and that there's
typically a therapeutic window where
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a dose that reduces agitation and
a higher dose that produces intoxication.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the only way you can get around that
and the problem is you got to do it in
[SPEAKER_08]: people.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can go through all the toxicology
studies, the dose response studies and try
[SPEAKER_08]: initially animals to get some idea of how
much blood concentration you need in order
[SPEAKER_08]: to get a therapeutic effect and then you
have to find a safe dose and then work,
[SPEAKER_08]: go tenfold lower that started with,
you know, with human CFA metabolize the
[SPEAKER_08]: drug the same way as in animals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now you're sort of doing this
backwards.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is going from humans to
animals.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the question of how that's going
to work out in the long term.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are out of time but I wanted to add
one thing to that is that we actually have
[SPEAKER_05]: a roadmap just like how the development of
curcumin is almost a roadmap for
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially how we pursue cannabinoids as
natural products.
[SPEAKER_05]: The FDA recent approval of Epidiolex,
that was based off of overwhelming
[SPEAKER_05]: anecdotal data that precipitated drug
development and interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a way to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a roadmap and it's how can we
learn through prospective observational
[SPEAKER_05]: studies through surveys and to help us
design the clinical trials and understand
[SPEAKER_05]: the questions we need to be asking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately we're out of time but I
just wanted to wrap up everything that was
[SPEAKER_05]: spoken about here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us a round of applause for our
panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day data is mixed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's inconclusive.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of work that needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Animals aren't humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last thing I'd like to add is that
the use of cannabinoids for Alzheimer's
[SPEAKER_05]: disease for both disease modification as
well as symptom management.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of our priority areas here at
the UCLA Cannabis Research Initiative.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy lunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: One more round of applause for our
panelists.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
