[SPEAKER_00]: Last year I spoke on autism, and this year
I really wanted to address epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has really been the majority of my
career, and an incredibly important topic
[SPEAKER_00]: for me personally, not just
professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to dedicate, really,
the talk to, see, I get emotional,
[SPEAKER_00]: but patient of mine, Cindy Mae Meehan,
who we lost in March last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: to epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if I broke up on that,
but she's a beautiful girl who I took care
[SPEAKER_00]: of since infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the great pleasure of knowing she
passed at age 13 due to her seizures,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it really highlights the importance of
really improving what we do for patients
[SPEAKER_00]: with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She taught me a great deal, personally and
professionally, as did her mother,
[SPEAKER_00]: Susan Meehan, and I'm sure some of you
probably know her.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth noting Dustin Sulek,
who's speaking tomorrow, also took care of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cindy Mae, and was just very warm and very
involved with the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we do what we do,
is to really help patients and to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: such a devastating consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a new therapy comes up,
and this is something that we've had to
[SPEAKER_00]: approach in both autism and epilepsy,
is we've had a lot of new therapies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not always clear up front what do
we do, what's the best approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's safest for the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of my approach to this,
and this really began to arise more in
[SPEAKER_00]: autism than epilepsy when I first started
out, but first we have to learn as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: we can about the treatment, and we have to
learn as much as we can about the patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: because from those two, we're ultimately
gonna balance risk-benefit, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really what we need to do so, so we can
provide proper informed consent to the
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some practical things that have helped
me in doing this, when we have therapies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are considered unproven, one is to
make one change at a time, because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to assess both for efficacy as well as
side effect, you always want to start low
[SPEAKER_00]: and go slow when you introduce a new
therapy, it's important to define what
[SPEAKER_00]: your goals are up front, so we know at
what point do we take away this therapy,
[SPEAKER_00]: at what point should we start to take away
some of the old therapies that you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: on, and so what's gonna be considered
success, and that's sometimes hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: define, and that also requires very
careful assessment of treatment response,
[SPEAKER_00]: and close follow-up, and we need to know
too that the therapy itself is consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: over its time course, because we don't
want to assume something is ineffective
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because the consistency is an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my practice, when cannabis was
approved for medicinal use, I was in Rhode
[SPEAKER_00]: Island at the time, and in terms of
knowing the patient, I first started with
[SPEAKER_00]: the most medically refractory patients,
because I figured if we had limited
[SPEAKER_00]: resources at that time, that's who we
needed to really focus on first.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make sure that we're doing it the right
way, we had, now in a small state,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was actually fairly easy,
we only had two licensed dispensaries at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, so I met with them, we tried to
figure out what are we gonna use for
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy, actually when they first opened,
epilepsy wasn't high on the radar,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we made sure that we got the strains we
needed, and we figured out what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna use in each patient, and how we're
gonna make sure it's consistent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as we introduced CBD, in this case we
started with ACDC strains, it was about,
[SPEAKER_00]: at that time about a 20 to one CBD to THC
ratio, we kind of held their other
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-seizure medications stable,
so we did one change at a time,
[SPEAKER_00]: we asked patients to keep very close
seizure journals, so we did seizure counts
[SPEAKER_00]: for four weeks leading up to the therapy
with all med stable, and continued those
[SPEAKER_00]: very close seizure counts after starting
therapy, and I did 24 hour EEGs before and
[SPEAKER_00]: after each patient, and also assessed
their anti-seizure medication levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that's what I chose to do in my own
practice, but at that time I had less data
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell me it was effective, and I wanted
to really be sure that I wasn't leading
[SPEAKER_00]: patients down a path way of something
ineffective, I'd seen many ineffective
[SPEAKER_00]: therapies along the way for various
things, and we wanted to be sure this was
[SPEAKER_00]: really working, and those were the things
that we did to help ensure that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna roll through, I have about a two
hour talk here, so I'm just gonna roll
[SPEAKER_00]: through it very quickly, but I wanna give
you some of my challenges in the office,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so having it approved by the state is
not even half the battle, and the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: summary of all of this is gonna be that
the scheduling is a major major problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: the clinical realm, in my opinion it
endangers both patients and caregivers in
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways, and so scheduling remains
a problem even though we have state
[SPEAKER_00]: approval, and I'm gonna give you examples
as to why, and so this is a typical
[SPEAKER_00]: patient I'd see, somebody who has Dravet
syndrome is a patient with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: seizure types, very refractory to our
existing therapies, and at risk,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are patients who are at risk of
dying from epilepsy, and so having gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through this many therapies, none of which
were working, we're causing side effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the mother asked me that
question, I've heard about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this something you can prescribe,
and I have to explain that well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really prescribe it exactly,
I can advise consideration, or I can have
[SPEAKER_00]: a first amendment right to a discussion on
the topic, but at this stage I still can't
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe it, I have a DA license which
would prohibit me from doing so,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in Massachusetts we have our own
specific requirements, each state has
[SPEAKER_00]: their own Massachusetts for pediatrics
patients, you need two certified
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians, you have to state,
you have to test that the patient has one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the medically required conditions,
and it's important to note that because I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't, because I can't technically
prescribe it, it really affects the way we
[SPEAKER_00]: practice, so first of all, how do I
document that, if a patient's telling me,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm helping advise a patient onto how
to start their dose, where to begin it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really document that without that
fear that I'm actually crossing that line
[SPEAKER_00]: from first amendment free speech into
prescription, of course that'll discourage
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians from being involved in this
area in the first place because the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't so clear, it's gonna limit our
ability to provide written instructions
[SPEAKER_00]: which we should do, but of course this
makes it complicated, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so how do we chart, how do we document
these things, in our notes, in our phone
[SPEAKER_00]: calls, in this patient she did start an
ACDC strain about a 20 to one ratio,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting about a quarter milligram per
pound per day, gradually increasing,
[SPEAKER_00]: did very well in improved alertness,
improved attention, no side effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures pretty dramatically improved,
so she has some breakthroughs during her
[SPEAKER_00]: menstrual cycle which is not uncommon,
but only one pediatric ICU admission for
[SPEAKER_00]: her in the last three years is phenomenal,
and again, potentially life saving,
[SPEAKER_00]: she was somebody who was very frequently
intubated, and often in the ICU,
[SPEAKER_00]: she continues to keep journals,
we continue to review her progress with
[SPEAKER_00]: teachers, with the parents,
neuropsychological assessments are very
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful, I think they should, it'd be
great ideally to do on every patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd be wonderful to see how the kids are
progressing with therapy, and we monitor,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, the consistency of the
treatment, we can independently test to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that what she's taking remains
consistent, and we monitor her
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-seizure medication levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other conditions, and I'll roll through
these really quickly, I won't present the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole history of reach for the sake of
time, again though, in Dravet syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very common that seizures remain
refractory, sometimes very prolonged,
[SPEAKER_00]: so in a patient who has seizures that are
20 minutes, 40 minutes, an hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: those become life threatening,
and those present a risk of harm,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if not life threatening, even a risk
of harm to the brain, a permanent risk,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so how can we treat that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this patient was actually giving,
and I have to credit Dr. Sulak for
[SPEAKER_00]: starting a few of these patients and
helping instruct on this, but this patient
[SPEAKER_00]: was using THC, she was using about a half
milligram per pound of the buccal mucosa
[SPEAKER_00]: for prolonged seizures, and worked
tremendously well for her, she noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: that before, she was using rectal valium,
which caused her to be sedated for the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire day, and wasn't working that well
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using THC through the buccal mucosa,
meaning the cheek, seizures were breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly, the patient was back to
herself in about an hour or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge difference, and now that's a little,
that always raises some caution for a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinician, because prolonged seizures are
such a potentially dangerous issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: so how do I do that in a way that's safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we would treat with
benzodiazepine after about five minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: into a seizure, so initially when the
first few patients came with this
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, or this question to me,
what we opted to do was actually treat
[SPEAKER_00]: them a little bit sooner, just because,
around a two to three minute mark,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wanted to still allow time to
see if the seizure broke, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: still had the option of using
benzodiazepine if need be, and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: most of my patients will do, they now have
two tools in the toolbox, they can use the
[SPEAKER_00]: buccal THC, or they can go back to diastat
or nasal midazolam, more standard
[SPEAKER_00]: therapies that they've used for many
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inpatient, this is a daily issue I face,
this came up last night, I got paged,
[SPEAKER_00]: emailed multiple people about a patient
who's inpatient now, this is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing topic, this will happen though,
if you treat patients as an outpatient,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for something like seizures,
eventually they're gonna get admitted,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't have hospital systems in
place presently to address this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, another example of a patient,
she had tried everything, nothing worked,
[SPEAKER_00]: only thing that worked was she was
actually on THC daily for her seizure,
[SPEAKER_00]: she had tried a really high CBD product
initially, which was not effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: she also used THC as a rescue,
so she was using it both as daily
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance plus rescue, working very well
for her, but the problem is every time she
[SPEAKER_00]: had a fever or infection, she'd present
with a prolonged seizure, and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: needed admission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here you have a patient, the only
thing that's worked is a cannabis product,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you give it in the hospital?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't, can you stop it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's complicated, and the short answer
is that most hospitals have not worked out
[SPEAKER_00]: a system here where they could do this
legally, and the problem remains the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal government plays a major role for
hospitals, so the Centers for Medicare and
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicaid, their requirement is that if you
have your own medication, whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: happens to be, whether it's your home
medication or an herbal product,
[SPEAKER_00]: they demand that the patient give it to
the pharmacist who will then confirm what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, and then dispense it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that if the pharmacist
dispenses a Schedule I medication,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a violation of the Controlled
Substance Act, so you're stuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these federal requirements are
obviously at odds with each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: but keep in mind, hospitals receive huge
federal funding, not just from Medicare
[SPEAKER_00]: and Medicaid, but research funding goes on
and on, so they don't want to violate the
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlled Substance Act for those
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states have taken steps to correct
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Connecticut, Governor Daniel Malloy did
sign legislation to protect nurses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut and Maine also explicitly
provide immunity to the hospitals,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hospitals are more important in
funding, I mean, what's more important is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the funding sometimes than the
immunity, and it still doesn't fully
[SPEAKER_00]: address the funding question, and that's
why I say that we still have to work out
[SPEAKER_00]: the scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This remains a major issue for the
inpatient, and the Controlled Substance
[SPEAKER_00]: Act does state that when you have state
and federal law at odds with each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to take the more stringent of
those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a problem, and I'm not a
lawyer, don't want to be one, or a
[SPEAKER_00]: politician, but we have a lot of work to
do here, because these are the options we
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either stop the cannabis products,
in which case the patient may go into a
[SPEAKER_00]: prolonged seizure, potentially
life-threatening, you could have the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient self-administer, but then Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid tell us we
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't do that, we should actually
confirm what's being given first,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then dispense it, or you could have
the hospital pharmacists do that and
[SPEAKER_00]: dispense it, but then they're violating
Controlled Substance Act, or you could do
[SPEAKER_00]: a Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy,
in which case it does create a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a problem, because you're not
documenting then what's actually being
[SPEAKER_00]: given.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be an issue if there are side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones I'll go a little faster,
but second opinion, second opinions come
[SPEAKER_00]: up a lot, and I see quite a few patients
with second opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets back to why we have to know the
patient very well, and also, so that's one
[SPEAKER_00]: critical thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is that the physician does
need to remain very involved in the care
[SPEAKER_00]: of all these patients, and this patient
highlights that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a 10-year-old boy, had been
diagnosed at another center with seizures,
[SPEAKER_00]: came to me on six different anti-seizure
meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mom on her own had started CBD,
but the seizures were actually escalating
[SPEAKER_00]: upon doing so, and she was wondering,
is the CBD making the seizures worse?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to figure that out, what we did is we
admitted him for video EEG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out the seizures that he was on
six medications for, and that the mom that
[SPEAKER_00]: started CBD for, actually were not
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were what we call psychogenic
non-epileptic seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many as 40, depending on the studies
you look at, as high as 40% of patients
[SPEAKER_00]: with epilepsy will have psychogenic
non-epileptic seizures, but of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: meds weren't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not what they worked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did have epilepsy, though, so many
patients had both.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not exclusive entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it explained why the treatment wasn't
working, and this highlights the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of the physician remaining
deeply involved with the care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient, and also why we have to have open
discussions about treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: School remains a major issue, so many of
my patients have to, this is an example of
[SPEAKER_00]: a patient who is taking a strain called
auto number two, was having afternoon
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures, so it was wearing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I used a higher morning dose,
she was a little more sedated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to find that balance,
so three times a day was perfect for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is the school nurse can't
administer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The schools, again, they receive Title I
funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most schools have zero tolerance policies
for any drugs on campus, and of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: nurse fears their own liability in
administering this sort of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have parents who drive to the school,
have to take the kid off the school
[SPEAKER_00]: grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My day's busy enough, my wife and I both
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't imagine how you do this,
but it's not easy, but this is what has to
[SPEAKER_00]: be done sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternatively, you could just raise the
morning dose, but then you might risk
[SPEAKER_00]: sedation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a few schools that have,
a few states that have moved towards
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting kids in school, and protecting
the schools themselves, and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: allow the legal guardian to administer the
treatment, and the students won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: punished for having them, or receiving
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some movement towards
improving this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Travel, of course, remains an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: A patient of mine, this came up last week,
so all these things I'm mentioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: like every one of these within the week
I've managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This patient came up just last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to make a wish trip to a state where
cannabis is not legal, medical cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, she called the TSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: TSA said, you're fine leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna do anything in
Massachusetts, but the problem is when you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to where you're arriving, we can't
guarantee what the TSA will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it leaves the mom with a couple
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you bring it in the luggage and risk
dealing with the TSA in the state you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you FedEx it to your arrival
destination?
[SPEAKER_00]: That raises other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hold it for the duration of the
vacation and risk seizures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you cancel your make-a-wish trip that
we just, we're looking forward to?
[SPEAKER_00]: All these bad options, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell you, I mean, I have little
side discussions with patients about what
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they can do, but many of those are
off the record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't mention those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I talk about the,
you know, politics directly affects what I
[SPEAKER_00]: do day in and day out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects how we document, how we
counsel, what we do in the hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: setting, what I do in school, what we do
for travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scheduling right now from my patients,
and I see a subset, I see mostly kids with
[SPEAKER_00]: autism and epilepsy, but it puts my
patients at harm, the current scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also puts physicians, nurses,
pharmacists, and the hospitals at fear of
[SPEAKER_00]: legal jeopardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even mention research,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it limits the physician's
willingness to see and treat patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is a major reason why so few
physicians are involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hinders our inpatient care,
prevents documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, primum non nocere is like the
overriding principle, first do no harm,
[SPEAKER_00]: that many physicians operate under.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to be careful that we don't
harm patients for fear of all the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to administer treatments
that don't work or are harmful,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also want to make sure that we're
not harming patients because we're overly
[SPEAKER_00]: cautious about our own liability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the uplifting part of this,
this is Susan, I'm going to cry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize, but this is Susan Meehan with
Governor Malloy, and she worked so hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: get legalization in Connecticut and was
successful, and that happened in October,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they named the law after my patient
Cindy May.
Thank you.
