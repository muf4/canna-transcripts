[SPEAKER_00]: but there are still great ticket packages
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to see you in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the details again at
canmedevents.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Israel Gaspren.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel is a visionary entrepreneur,
engineering scientist, and the founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Zentrella, a company dedicated to
transforming cannabis research through
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced neurotechnology and AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under Israel's leadership, Zentrella
developed the Psychoactive Effect Level
[SPEAKER_00]: metric, an innovative EEG-based measure
capable of objectively assessing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products' psychoactive potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: By combining wearable EEG technology with
AI-driven EEG analysis, the PEL metric
[SPEAKER_00]: provides cannabis producers, researchers,
and regulators with a non-invasive and
[SPEAKER_00]: cost-effective way to quantify product
effects and maintain quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 25, Israel will share results
from over 10,000 EEG scans of consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: using a wide range of cannabis products in
his oral presentation titled, Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Effects Research Driven by EEG Technology
and Machine Learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss how
Zentrella's wearable EEG technology got
[SPEAKER_00]: its start measuring drowsiness in truck
drivers, the unreliability of consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback surveys with regards to cannabis
product effects, how the PEL metric was
[SPEAKER_00]: created to measure the unique psychoactive
effects of cannabis, how EEG data can be
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to objectively measure the quality
and effectiveness of cannabis products
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond simple cannabinoid percentages,
research findings that show THC percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: and PEL percentage are not directly
correlated, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Israel, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, the Dent Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: With more than 300,000 patient visits per
year, the Dent Neurologic Institute ranks
[SPEAKER_00]: among the largest neuroscience centers in
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its 24 subspecialty clinics often treat
the most challenging neurologic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, including, but not limited to,
migraine, chronic pain, ALS, MS,
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's, dementia, and neuro-oncology.
[SPEAKER_00]: With their mission of advancing
neuroscience, the Dent Institute
[SPEAKER_00]: established a cannabis clinic in 2016 to
aid in the treatment of these chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions seen throughout the Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn more at DentInstitute.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Israel Gasparin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to tell you more about our
technologies and to rely on sharing all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this information with your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm excited to talk with you today
about this wearable EEG technology that
[SPEAKER_00]: your team has developed to measure the
effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the user's brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with what inspired you to
develop this technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I was thinking about this the
other day and the main inspiration to
[SPEAKER_01]: build this technology was in 2016 when the
Canadian government was in the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: legalizing recreational cannabis
consumption and the lack of a test to
[SPEAKER_01]: objectively determine if a person is
cannabis impaired or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, we were building this
technology to detect drowsiness while
[SPEAKER_01]: driving and we wanted to help truck
companies to keep their drivers alert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were telling us about this
upcoming legalization of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption for non-medical purposes and
that they didn't have a way of detecting
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis impairment and that the current
way, which is analyzing and detecting
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration levels of THC in saliva,
urine, blood or breath, there didn't exist
[SPEAKER_01]: a test to analyze the brain of drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were like, okay, that's the aha
moment when we decided to pivot from
[SPEAKER_01]: detecting drowsiness while driving to
detecting cannabis impairment while
[SPEAKER_01]: driving and in that way help multiple
markets to better determine if a person is
[SPEAKER_01]: or not impaired because that's the biggest
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know very well that THC remains in
body fluids for many hours, days or weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: post impairment or experiencing its
effects and that leads to inaccurate
[SPEAKER_01]: determinations about being impaired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the main reason that inspired
us to build this technology and once we
[SPEAKER_01]: built it, we realized that the need for
this type of brain wave analysis was even
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger and beyond the safety and
enforcement applications and that other
[SPEAKER_01]: application was for research to better
understand the effects and the quality and
[SPEAKER_01]: the efficacy of all of these innovative
products and, you know, breeds and strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that the market is developing and that's
how all this started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so really to start, it was to try to
determine how impaired a driver was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the Ontario Brain Institute and
the Ontario Center of Innovation to
[SPEAKER_01]: Ontario government organizations only
funded us to, to, to develop this
[SPEAKER_01]: technology and that's how we were able to
build it because I hope you will
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate it and your audience will
appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2016, nobody really, well, not many
were familiarized and, and believers of
[SPEAKER_01]: the potential of artificial intelligence,
specifically when it's applied in brain
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the government was the one that
believed in this, you know, potential
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy opportunity to, you know,
complement the current investigation
[SPEAKER_01]: process of cannabis impaired driving
determination and they were the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: funded us to, to build this technology,
build it to a commercially level kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: a, yeah, a level of commercial viability
and then conducting independent trials to
[SPEAKER_01]: prove that AI can do this type of brain
wave analysis at a way faster and more
[SPEAKER_01]: cost effective way and accurate than a
neurologist or neuroscientist doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: individually or manually, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's how all this started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an AI component as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, the, the main differentiator
and the uniqueness of our approach,
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way, because EEG technology is not
really new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been used for more than 100 years,
but in the medical space, neurologists,
[SPEAKER_01]: neuroscientists, EEG technicians,
certified EEG technicians have been using
[SPEAKER_01]: it for more than 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, and in fact, we came to
this conclusion and realized that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the main reason why EEG technology has
been inaccessible to several global
[SPEAKER_01]: non-medical markets, because when you
require a neurologist and neuroscientist
[SPEAKER_01]: and EEG technology is built for medical
applications, it becomes very expensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: very complicated to use, very slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes it not commercially viable
for all of these type of markets that are
[SPEAKER_01]: also conducting some type of human
research, not necessarily clinical or
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic, but it's more about
understanding what is the state of being
[SPEAKER_01]: of individuals to make better decisions in
terms of safety, you know, the law
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement, product testing, product
quality testing, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a great technology for that
application, especially because,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you said, the concentrations in the
blood or saliva, they can last for much
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than people are actually affected
and we've had folks on the podcast talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about those challenges before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great advancement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about it, it's the exact
same problem that we have when it's about
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring the quality of cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, finally, I think the industry has
kind of gained more awareness about the
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic that represents judging and
determining the quality of a product just
[SPEAKER_01]: by the THC metric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very well known that, you know,
that doesn't necessarily determine the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and efficacy of a product to
create an intended psychoactive effect or
[SPEAKER_01]: other type of effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only about THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's overall, if you think about it,
it's a complete change of paradigm in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of measuring product quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we will always continue
measuring the quality of ingredients and
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately determining the concentration
levels of those ingredients in products
[SPEAKER_01]: and plants, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another big, big thing is determining
its quality to deliver the intended
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's our vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why we exist is that
analyzing the brain in a fast cost-defense
[SPEAKER_01]: objective and scientific way is the
approach to really determining a new way
[SPEAKER_01]: what consumers are experiencing and
measuring it in a reliable and scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's accepted by all the stakeholders
because I think that's the other big
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge that we have seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many solutions, but I think
coming up with a solution that all the
[SPEAKER_01]: main stakeholders of the industry will
accept, I think that that's the actual,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, event that needs to happen
someday in order to become a new standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we are kind of attempting
to do long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the industry really needs sort of
an objective way to evaluate the effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make the comparison all the time to
alcohol, but where cannabis is really
[SPEAKER_00]: different from alcohol is that you know,
is the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you drink alcohol, I mean,
maybe you feel a little bit different when
[SPEAKER_00]: you drink tequila versus beer,
but for all intents and purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not what is differentiating your
products, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more about the flavor or things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with cannabis, the experience can
be very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having an objective way to maybe
measure that or show an effect is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, in fact, I think that is
it's an undefined, unexplored space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we talk about cannabis effects,
but there are probably hundreds of effects
[SPEAKER_01]: that are created by cannabis and different
cannabinoids, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, just
differentiating them alone, it's something
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have never, ever done,
you know, in the entire history of
[SPEAKER_01]: humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that now, I think that the
implementation of EEG technology with
[SPEAKER_01]: machine learning and science, et cetera,
is giving us the opportunity for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time to come up with universal and
scientific and measurable definitions of
[SPEAKER_01]: what a cannabis effect mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's one of the most
exciting opportunities to me to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what is the potential of this
technology for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to get back to the point of
subjectivity here, which is the big matter
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have been dealing with is that
because of this huge variability,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this huge array of effects that
cannabis creates, it's very subjective and
[SPEAKER_01]: uneasy to provide different types of
feedback, which is what has been happening
[SPEAKER_01]: with consumers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I might take two milligrams of THC and I
could start feeling the body high and
[SPEAKER_01]: random and uncontrollable thoughts,
which is the head high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another person might feel strongly relaxed
just with two milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might score in the drug effect
questionnaire, a high level of,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, a strong cannabis effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are completely different
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the unreliability of just
simply using or getting the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback if it's not a standardized and
objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that scenario and with your
technology, are you able to see different
[SPEAKER_00]: areas of the brain lighting up on those
different people who are experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think maybe it's important to provide
a little bit of context to your audience
[SPEAKER_01]: about the approach that is used with
machine learning and artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligence compared to the current
traditional approach that has been used
[SPEAKER_01]: for more than 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current approach is all based on
neuroscientists and neurologists doing
[SPEAKER_01]: very deep and clinical analysis of how
different regions of the brain are
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulated by substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are tens of papers explaining
how cannabis and other drugs and other
[SPEAKER_01]: things impact your brain functionality and
the specific regions of the brain,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this analysis hasn't been standardized
because of the complexity of just simply
[SPEAKER_01]: detecting specific changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a complicated combination of
patterns or changes happening in multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: regions of the brain, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: AI and machine learning is based on having
large, large data sets of information that
[SPEAKER_01]: you reliably know what they mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to build this technology,
we had to conduct large scientific human
[SPEAKER_01]: trials approved, of course, by independent
ethnic research boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was how we used the funds that we
raised to build these large data sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were conducting manually and
carefully under controlled scenarios human
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were observing and controlling how
study subjects were in taking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used multiple approaches to
reliably characterize the type of mental,
[SPEAKER_01]: cognitive, or emotional state that they
were experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And associate that to which of those are
related to or uniquely created by cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and which ones are just added.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the things that are altered by
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, emotions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emotions, maybe cannabis might make you
feel more happy, happier, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That state is universal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But getting back to the point,
yes, we have built these huge databases
[SPEAKER_01]: that now are enabling us not only to
generate the PEL metric, the PEL or
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactive effect level metric,
is specifically designed to detect this
[SPEAKER_01]: mental state that is making you experience
unique cannabis psychoactive effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the body high, the head high,
and these famously called deontor effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, the AI that we are building is
also helping us to develop other metrics
[SPEAKER_01]: that measure, for example, what is the
relaxation state of study subjects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on that now, also quantify how
cannabis or specific cannabis or specific
[SPEAKER_01]: products or specific amounts of a product
will impact that relaxation state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it help you to relax or feel sleepy
or actually stimulate you to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to be mentally active and
socialize and do this kind of stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically the equivalent of the
indica and sativa thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is another meter that exists in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So AI for EEG analysis is measuring
multiple types of cannabis effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so are all those different effects,
are they all sort of combined into that
[SPEAKER_00]: PEL metric?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we are building different
metrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one specific reason, Benjamin,
for example, the relaxation or energy or
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are mental states, universal mental
states that are not necessarily and only
[SPEAKER_01]: impacted by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are also impacted by L-thionine and
melatonin and herbs, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: caffeine, energy drinks, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we strategically build these other
metrics as stand-alones and independents
[SPEAKER_01]: because now we are also helping not only
the cannabis CPG market, but other
[SPEAKER_01]: wellness and health CPG markets that,
by the way, have the exact same problem
[SPEAKER_01]: that the cannabis CPG market has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their products are marketed by clinically
proven L-thionine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how did you prove that the way you
mix a certain amount of L-thionine with
[SPEAKER_01]: other active ingredients or non-active
ingredients and use a specific drug
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery method and the format,
et cetera, the way that it will be
[SPEAKER_01]: consumed, how did you prove that that is
the most effective way of delivering an
[SPEAKER_01]: intended effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: And these other metrics are not only
helping cannabis for relaxation,
[SPEAKER_01]: energy or the sleep effects, are helping
all these other wellness and health CPG
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that PEL, that is a specific effect for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping you would share a bit about
the kind of the findings that you found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what were the different products that
you were testing and comparing to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other and sort of what stood out or what
was surprising to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very much looking forward to
presenting these work in detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at CanMed 2025 in beautiful Puerto
Rico.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is just a huge database of product
effects that we have been accumulating,
[SPEAKER_01]: Benjamin, from different product formats,
consumption methods and consumption
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts and different types of consumers
that have consumed those types of
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have been doing studies with,
for example, with Pax Labs, we conducted a
[SPEAKER_01]: partnership with them in order to study
the psychoactive effect levels of live
[SPEAKER_01]: rossing oils that are vaporized versus
distillate THC pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the biggest takeaways of that
is that thanks to our metric, we were able
[SPEAKER_01]: to show the quality and the famously
called underbrush effect that creates
[SPEAKER_01]: having a live rossing product,
which for those who don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a combination of you extract all the
ingredients and properties, more than
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients, all the properties that are
in a plant when you squeeze it and get all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the terpenes and several minor
cannabinoids, THC and all of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of chemicals in that plant versus
just isolating THC through distillation
[SPEAKER_01]: and coming up with that an oil just with
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this is suggesting is that live
rossing, or at least the way this company
[SPEAKER_01]: built it, is creating a stronger
psychoactive effects than just distillate
[SPEAKER_01]: THC alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, both products suggest that
they have between 92 to 96% of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the actual quality of the experience
is significantly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is very important to them because
then now brands like Pax are now are also
[SPEAKER_01]: using this type of data to educate
consumers and highlight why a live rossing
[SPEAKER_01]: product is a high quality product,
a premium and more expensive product than
[SPEAKER_01]: the distillate THC alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is one, but we have been doing a
lot of research with strains like joints
[SPEAKER_01]: that have flowers that have 15 or less
percent of THC versus 30% of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been doing research with beverages
that have two or 2.5 milligrams of THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: quantify how that psychoactive effect
level changes based on consuming 2.5,
[SPEAKER_01]: drinking 2.5 of THC, five milligrams or 10
milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have also been doing research about
what about changing the consumption
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern of a drink because you can have a
beverage in 10 minutes and that will be a
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The onset time and the potency of the
experience will change than if you are
[SPEAKER_01]: just sipping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A 10 milligram THC beverage, you are
sipping it over an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: How that changes the psychoactive
experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that will continue
helping a lot with consumer education and
[SPEAKER_01]: helping them to make informed and
responsible consumption decisions so they
[SPEAKER_01]: can maximize the pleasant experience of
cannabis and minimize the unpleasant
[SPEAKER_01]: effects, which is they are real and it's
the elephant in the room that many don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to talk about it, but the reality is
that also managing and minimizing the
[SPEAKER_01]: negative effects like paranoia and
anxiety, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: is critical and right now, to the best of
my knowledge, nobody is really helping
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers to do that and I think that is
potentially the holy grail to just invite
[SPEAKER_01]: many curious people to try cannabis,
have a great experience and then adopt it
[SPEAKER_01]: as a as another alternative than alcohol
or other substances or products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that sort of that paranoia,
anxiety, that negative effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a metric that you can actually
measure?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is exactly right, Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was so interesting
because when we started to build this
[SPEAKER_01]: technology and start conducting research,
we didn't really know many things about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I vividly remember when some very
frequent and daily cannabis consumers used
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell me, you know what, you know,
I can I can, you know, smoke a joint,
[SPEAKER_01]: but and I can do as many puffs as I want
or you you need for the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a point where I just don't
continue getting higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: It flattens and it doesn't change
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we found out with our EEG
technology and also at that time,
[SPEAKER_01]: administration of psychological tests
proven to characterize your mood,
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest takeaway was that,
yes, at a certain point, study subjects
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't feel more higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with our EEG scans and the PEL
psychoactive effect level metric,
[SPEAKER_01]: we showed and obtained objective evidence
that the PEL, the psychoactive effect
[SPEAKER_01]: level they were experiencing was the same
whether you were having, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: around six to nine puffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the exact number or 11 to
20 something puffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same psychoactive effect level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it was changing was their mood
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first group was experiencing serene
and positive effects like feeling more
[SPEAKER_01]: serene, whereas the other group was
feeling anxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think in an ideal world,
which I think it will happen sooner or
[SPEAKER_01]: later, I think that the strains will be
solved with this information that will
[SPEAKER_01]: indicate how many puffs you should intake
according to the properties of that strain
[SPEAKER_01]: and potentially according to the profile
of consumers in order to maximize those
[SPEAKER_01]: pleasing effects and minimize anxiety and
paranoia and all of those unpleasant
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the PEL actually measuring if
not sort of mood and that sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how impaired a person is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the PEL metric?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically measured measuring specific
and unique brain wave alterations
[SPEAKER_01]: associated to the specific psychoactive
effects of cannabis or THC or these other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis related to these psychoactive
effects like feeling the body high,
[SPEAKER_01]: the random uncontrollable thoughts and the
head high, all of these effects that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they are therapeutic to
the best of my knowledge, but they create
[SPEAKER_01]: this like nothing else to the best of my
knowledge creates that type of a specific
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the PEL metric generate,
you know, measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other metrics that we have now measure
other type of effects like whether you are
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling more energized or more relaxed or
sleepy, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I see that is that the device
behind you back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our own wearable device.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason behind, because somebody
asked me, why the heck did you build your
[SPEAKER_01]: own device if there are so many in the
market?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, for the specific
reason that there is nothing that really
[SPEAKER_01]: works for this type of research that we
are conducting for non-therapeutic and
[SPEAKER_01]: non-medical applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just about mood effects and cannabis
effects, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to do it, you need to make it
very cost effective and very
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to be measuring the head,
like the head of the study subjects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from here measure X number of,
you know, centimeters or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 10-20 system, we converted all of
that into basic standardized, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: indicators to apply the device so quickly
and easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone, and anyone I mean, food
scientists, product developers,
[SPEAKER_01]: my team and I, who I'm not a
neuroscientist either, are able to use
[SPEAKER_01]: this technology and collect EEG data for
this type of scientific research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, researchers, they could
develop their own sort of their own trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is exactly right, Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We created some, let me call it a
standardized master EEG research protocol
[SPEAKER_01]: that has been approved by Health Canada
and have been approved multiple times by
[SPEAKER_01]: different independent ethnic research
boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beauty of our standardized
research protocol is that it enables our
[SPEAKER_01]: partners, because we don't only do
research in our lab, we are implementing
[SPEAKER_01]: this technology in other labs and research
hospitals, is that they can customize,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can, typically what we do is EEG
recordings before the intervention or
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption of a product, and then after
the consumption of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the after consumption recordings are
completely customizable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do many EEG scans or recordings
right at the beginning, the first 30
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes, if your objective is to capture
the onset time as accurately as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that as resolution,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The more samples, the higher the
resolution to see how that evolves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also you can do it, you know,
you can just record the EEG of study
[SPEAKER_01]: subjects and map that product experience
for up to 30 minutes or 45 minutes or one
[SPEAKER_01]: hour or three hours or up to five hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Et cetera, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you know, customize that
according to the needs of the needs and
[SPEAKER_01]: objectives of the company or research
organization that is conducting research
[SPEAKER_01]: in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I have to imagine this being,
you know, AI and machine learning,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more data that folks are generating,
it's just going to feed into the system
[SPEAKER_00]: and just improve it, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just a snowball because the
more data we collect, the more AI will
[SPEAKER_01]: continue learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we will get to a point
where the PEL metric will not only measure
[SPEAKER_01]: the high and how strong is that effect,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will also tell us what type of high you
are experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you experiencing the body high or the
head high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or hallucinations, I don't know,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it will get to that level of
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even better, I think that it will get
to a point where we will be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: personalize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine that at a certain point,
and I want to be one of the first ones to
[SPEAKER_01]: say it because I really think it will
happen, is that these devices will become,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, gadgets for consumers where you
will be able to wear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will read your brainwaves and will know
who you are, what type of brain you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on that, you will tell this app,
hey, you know, I want to relax today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you are this type of brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the type of products that you
should consume and this is how you should
[SPEAKER_01]: consume them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that would be one of the
latest stages of adoption of wearable
devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with technology and AI for
these types of consumer packaged goods
[SPEAKER_01]: markets, like personalized recommendations
of products used to accomplish an
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I can definitely see a
future with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wear my Apple watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I track my recovery and all that to inform
if I should work out or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely seems like that's a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally, Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we believe in this 10 years ago
and that's why we continue doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: because somebody needs to do it and we
want to be one of the first in doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just really think that nobody has
built the databases that are required to
[SPEAKER_01]: unlock the potential of artificial
intelligence to help us make this type of
[SPEAKER_01]: brain analysis to understand cognitive,
emotional, or mental states of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that this is just the
beginning of many other applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: This technology, as I was sharing with
you, was built for safety and
[SPEAKER_01]: reinforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just realized 10 years ago or eight
years ago that cops were not going to use
[SPEAKER_01]: this technology right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, because it's a little bit of
removing a little bit of their power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not longer you giving your
expert opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still subjective, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now, you know, an objective
assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was very controversial at
that time to prove that you could have THC
[SPEAKER_01]: in saliva and in our EEG show that your
brainwaves are not altered anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our peer reviewed publications show
that this evidence could eliminate up to
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% of inaccurate accusations of being
impaired or not being impaired just
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the amount of THC in saliva or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that these neurotechnology,
not only centralis, maybe others,
[SPEAKER_01]: will be adopted by several other
non-medical markets that continue
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on subjective assessments of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a very very, very exciting time
for everyone who is in these spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you talk about impairment,
too, would it work for alcohol to
[SPEAKER_00]: correlate someone's blood alcohol content
to how affected they actually are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I think that right now our
perception of impairment is a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if limited in the world,
but maybe it's not fully aware of what
[SPEAKER_01]: impairment is.
[SPEAKER_01]: What impairment means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you could be driving and
you are impaired because you are in shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are hyper stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are extremely tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are extremely pissed because something
happened to you and you are driving so
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressively.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you may be drunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be high with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be high with so many other
substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's why I was mentioning
building these databases directly
[SPEAKER_01]: associated to all of these states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what it will unlock the law
enforcement use of this type of technology
[SPEAKER_01]: to better, you know, to improve safety on
our roads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's not we haven't
forgotten about that market, but we just
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that is just the tip of the
iceberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a longer term application.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that just for pure, you know,
cannabis effect research for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: educational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help brands, you know, prove,
you know, product quality and
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiate their products is just an on
tap market that is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we have been doing in the
last three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're talking about like sort of
personalizing it and having, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of your own for sort of your personal
use, like I can imagine, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were wearing something,
it's probably a different device,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're getting ready to write a an
email to someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of triggers like you might be a
little too upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to keep on it before you
write that email.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brokers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't invest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you are super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be more, you know, objective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like measuring that type of emotions will
enable many other markets to make better,
[SPEAKER_01]: more accurate, more informed decisions
about some many other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so wrapping up here, so you mentioned
that you're coming to Can Med 25 in Puerto
[SPEAKER_00]: Rico this June, and we're very excited to
have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to be presenting this this
data and sharing this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious, what folks are you
interested in connecting with there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe this is a good time to
kind of put out there who you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to connect with so that they can come down
and meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very much looking forward to,
you know, connecting with other
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers and product developers and and
food scientists and and high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those, you know, licensed producers
that are building truly innovative and
[SPEAKER_01]: high quality products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very much looking forward to meeting
with them and presenting our work,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I really think that one of the
biggest challenges that the entire the
[SPEAKER_01]: global cannabis market is facing is
saturation and undifferentiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and right now, the consumer is not
aware of that, and they don't believe in
[SPEAKER_01]: words.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we have been doing in
Massachusetts, which I will be presenting,
[SPEAKER_01]: is about the way we are helping all of
these companies to differentiate their
[SPEAKER_01]: high quality products, regardless of their
cannabinoid properties, and leverage that
[SPEAKER_01]: to really transform the way they develop
products, they test them, and also they
[SPEAKER_01]: take them to market and educate retailers
and consumers to really differentiate
[SPEAKER_01]: their brands and their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think that that's the future
of Cannabis CPG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very much looking forward to
connecting with other companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: really appreciate this scientific approach
to innovate and differentiate their
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you will be in the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing before I let you go,
I want to give you an opportunity to share
[SPEAKER_00]: any additional resources that the
listeners or viewers might be interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in reading more about to learn more about
the technology and the things that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, websites, social media,
anything like that, please plug away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the best way to bring you up
to speed is to connect on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the platform I use to share news,
share some of the highest and most
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting results that you know,
as soon as we complete the studies,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Israel Gasparin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on LinkedIn with my
complete name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you know, our website, Centralla
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most importantly, if you look for peer
reviewed publications using the name of
[SPEAKER_01]: our artificial intelligence, the
Cognalizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cognalizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cognalizer because we have a breath
analyzer, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the cognitive analyzer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cognalizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find our peer reviewed
publications that, you know, prove and
[SPEAKER_01]: explain and elaborate the objectivity,
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and
[SPEAKER_01]: applications of this technology for
multiple types of human research or
[SPEAKER_01]: investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that could be a very good
introductory kind of content that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: gain to get more context and hopefully
when we meet at Canmet, we can have more
[SPEAKER_01]: insightful and interesting conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put links to all of those resources
in the show description so people can
[SPEAKER_00]: easily find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel, thanks again for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great talk and looking forward to
meeting you in person down in Puerto Rico
[SPEAKER_00]: in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds great, Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again for having me and having
this very exciting conversation and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking forward to meeting you in person
as well.
Thank you.
