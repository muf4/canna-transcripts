[SPEAKER_04]: About four years ago, I had the pleasure
of meeting Lucy with her daughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time, she was 89 years old and
had been diagnosed with advanced stage
[SPEAKER_04]: dementia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her dementia was so advanced that she was
incomprehensible with her speech.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was falling every day and was now
becoming a safety risk in her own home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the facility where she lived was
requesting that Lucy be moved into a
[SPEAKER_04]: memory care unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucy had a 40-year history of multiple
sclerosis and migraines and insomnia.
[SPEAKER_04]: She'd been using Dilaudid and gabapentin
along with Ambien.
[SPEAKER_04]: Louder?
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you missed a really good story.
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Lucy had a 40-year history of multiple
sclerosis, migraines, as well as insomnia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she'd been using Dilaudid,
gabapentin, and Ambien to manage her
[SPEAKER_04]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I met with her daughter who had
durable power of health care and Lucy,
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucy didn't even engage with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: She couldn't focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her speech was incomprehensible.
[SPEAKER_04]: We decided to focus on her pain and sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started Lucy on a one-to-one,
2.5-milligram THC and 2.5-milligram CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: capsule twice a day and 10 milligrams of a
one-to-one at night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within three months, we were successfully
able to get Lucy off her gabapentin,
[SPEAKER_04]: her Ambien, and her Dilaudid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she only needed to take her high blood
pressure medications.
[SPEAKER_04]: She became alert and oriented.
[SPEAKER_04]: She lost 25 pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: She stopped falling.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was sleeping through the night.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the first time in 40 years,
Lucy did not complain of pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: She had such a remarkable recovery that
her daughter was successful at getting her
[SPEAKER_04]: diagnosis of advanced-age dementia removed
from her medical record.
[SPEAKER_04]: About six months after taking cannabis,
the med tech came by one day and knocked
[SPEAKER_04]: on her door and said, Lucy, I have your
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Lucy said, I don't take marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her daughter who had durable power of
health care was able to make that decision
[SPEAKER_04]: for her but hadn't had that conversation
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that opened up the conversation and
Lucy realized that she did get her life
[SPEAKER_04]: back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so she started to become an advocate
at her facility, talking to other
[SPEAKER_04]: residents about the use of cannabis for
their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fast forward three years later,
Lucy was turning 92.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was originally from France.
[SPEAKER_04]: And her daughter wanted to surprise her
with a trip to France for the first time
[SPEAKER_04]: in 50 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Tanya called me and she said,
Eloise, how do I travel to France with
[SPEAKER_04]: mom's cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, you don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, well, we should probably take
her off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if her symptoms return, you may need
to consider pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And within a week, her symptoms started to
return and she was placed back on
[SPEAKER_04]: gabapentin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And within 10 days on gabapentin,
her speech became incomprehensible again
[SPEAKER_04]: and she started to have multiple falls.
[SPEAKER_04]: The daughter was clearly frustrated,
took her off gabapentin and sent me an
[SPEAKER_04]: email and said, I am going to just mail it
ahead of the time to the hotel and hope it
[SPEAKER_04]: makes it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, please don't tell me that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to know that you're smuggling
drugs into France.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she laughs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a week later, I got the email
that said, the eagle has landed.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Eloise Thiessen and I'm a board
certified adult geriatric nurse
[SPEAKER_04]: practitioner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a clinic in Walnut Creek with a
physician, Dr. David Ferreira,
[SPEAKER_04]: where we now treat patients who want to
use cannabis as a treatment modality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen close to 5,500 patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And within those 5,500 patients,
you'll see here what I'm going to present
[SPEAKER_04]: today is some of the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, the average age of my patient is
about 76.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're primarily female at 85%.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've never used cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see, they don't want to
smoke it and they don't want to get high
[SPEAKER_04]: and more recently, they asked me not to
gain weight or get the munchies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things that I recognized as
a clinician was that there's really no way
[SPEAKER_04]: for me to collect cannabis data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked and looked for an electronic
health record that would help me put
[SPEAKER_04]: patient information in there and start to
provide me with some feedback on my data.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this data that I collected here was
by me going through manually handwritten
[SPEAKER_04]: charts that patients had filled out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was fortunate enough to find a
company that is working on some data
[SPEAKER_04]: collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they came in and looked at about 220
of my chronic pain patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see that the numbers are much
different than my overall patient
[SPEAKER_04]: population.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have about 34% of females are coming to
me specifically for pain and about close
[SPEAKER_04]: to 50 of them are male.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see that 17% is blank because
what we realize is that it's not a
[SPEAKER_04]: mandatory field for them to identify their
gender.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is definitely something we learned
from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any way you could get my
PowerPoints a little bit bigger on here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need the notes after all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you mind, please?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I can't see.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually tell the joke when my picture
comes up because patients ask me if that's
[SPEAKER_04]: my daughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, cannabis doesn't help with
gray hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nor does it help with baldness.
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently, you can put it in your
athletic wear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other trends that we identified here
were whether or not patients had any
[SPEAKER_04]: previous experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my pain population of these 220
patients, we found about almost 35% had no
[SPEAKER_04]: previous experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't currently using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And about 48% had at least tried it at
some point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we have a blank area because we
realized that it's not a mandatory field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are some of the different pain
categories that they identified.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll see most patients are coming to
me are cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: My background prior to cannabis was
oncology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's natural for patients to come see
me for symptom relief related to cancer
[SPEAKER_04]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them identified it as chronic
pain or other symptoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other diseases that were causing pain like
Lyme disease or lupus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stenosis was also a big category.
[SPEAKER_04]: The different routes of administration,
although 62% weren't currently using it to
[SPEAKER_04]: treat their pain, the 37% that were using
it, most of them were using sublingual
[SPEAKER_04]: followed by topical and then ingestion and
inhalation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I do my data collection,
I do do a full review of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes patients will come to me for
chronic pain, but through that review of
[SPEAKER_04]: systems, I'll actually identify other ways
that cannabis may be helpful for them,
[SPEAKER_04]: like mood improvement, sleep, anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of them identified cardiovascular
issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a lot of patients who have high
blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that as we age, blood pressure
rates can go up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a lot of patients with atrial
fibrillation, other musculoskeletal
[SPEAKER_04]: issues, urinary issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I have a lot of females,
so typically that means they're having
[SPEAKER_04]: incontinence, respiratory issues like
coughing or shortness of breath.
[SPEAKER_04]: So chronic pain is definitely something
that we're all probably going to
[SPEAKER_04]: experience as we age, although the
statistics say that about one in four
[SPEAKER_04]: adults over the age of 65 will report
chronic pain by 2035.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now it's costing us about $560
billion per year in direct medical costs,
[SPEAKER_04]: lost productivity and disability.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also know it's one of the most common
conditions in older adults 65 and up,
[SPEAKER_04]: with 40% of them reporting chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more common in females and patients
over the age of 85.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when people have chronic pain,
they're also likely to suffer from
[SPEAKER_04]: depression, anxiety, insomnia,
isolation, and falls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's our current pharmacological
recommendations for geriatric patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our standard of care.
[SPEAKER_04]: We start them at acetaminophen or Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's usually for low to moderate
pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have quite a bit of evidence,
high quality of evidence to demonstrate
[SPEAKER_04]: that Tylenol or acetaminophen is safe and
effective for chronic pain, although we
[SPEAKER_04]: have to be very concerned about potential
liver toxicity in this population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we move into NSAIDs or your
ibuprofen, your anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, these two are available over the
counter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have quite a bit of evidence,
high amount of evidence to demonstrate
[SPEAKER_04]: that NSAIDs or anti-inflammatories can be
effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should only be using them for
short-term use, though, because the
[SPEAKER_04]: long-term effects, especially in anybody
over the age of 65, can be things like
[SPEAKER_04]: decreased kidney function, increased risk
of atrial fibrillation, and gastritis or
[SPEAKER_04]: gastrointestinal side effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell you how many patients I have
that are using Tylenol and ibuprofen just
[SPEAKER_04]: over the counter, without the direction of
a clinician or physician, because they
[SPEAKER_04]: think it's safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the acetaminophen or NSAIDs are
ineffective, we can go to tramadol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was doing my research,
I found this incredibly interesting,
[SPEAKER_04]: that the quality of evidence to support
using tramadol in geriatric patients has
[SPEAKER_04]: not been reported.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're happy to give this to our
patients, especially because we want to
[SPEAKER_04]: avoid opioids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my updated slides didn't get in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an error on the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an error on the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll notice we have tricyclic
antidepressants that can be used for
[SPEAKER_04]: neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have anticonvulsants, like the
gabapentin, which can be used for
[SPEAKER_04]: neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have low to moderate evidence in those
medications.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, they seem to be widely
prescribed when I'm meeting with patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Safety considerations in our
anticonvulsants should be peripheral
[SPEAKER_04]: edema, not neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, opioids, right,
which we're using for moderate to severe
[SPEAKER_04]: pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the quality of evidence is low.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have safety considerations,
you know, as tolerance, sedation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, death is the biggest safety
consideration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's cannabis, which is not
currently on our pharmacological standard
[SPEAKER_04]: of care for geriatric patients,
or any patient, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The quality of evidence is high,
not IGH.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have quite a bit of, you know,
we even know that the National Academy of
[SPEAKER_04]: Sciences recommends cannabis for chronic
pain, particularly neuropathic and
[SPEAKER_04]: spasticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: In safety considerations, dizziness,
sedation, potential hallucinations,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we all know, we heard this earlier,
this is dose dependent.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can control these side effects much
easier with cannabis than we can the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical options.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with opioids, we know that we're now
experiencing, we're seeing about 130
[SPEAKER_04]: deaths per day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I started to observe in my clinic
is that with the CDC guidelines were
[SPEAKER_04]: changed in 2016, they changed the practice
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what they noticed in the
literature from 2004 and 2009,
[SPEAKER_04]: not the literature, when they looked at
overdoses from 2004 to 2009, they saw that
[SPEAKER_04]: dosages prescribed at 48 and that MME is
morphine milli equivalent dosages,
[SPEAKER_04]: between 48 and 98 per day, was where they
saw the highest rate of overdoses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the CDC came in and said, let's lower
the morphine milli equivalent to 50
[SPEAKER_04]: milligrams a day, and not to exceed 90
unless documentation supports higher
[SPEAKER_04]: dosages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to give you an idea of a morphine
equivalent, that's about 5, 10 milligram
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrocodone a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's happened is that, clinicians,
physicians are coming in and starting to
[SPEAKER_04]: reduce these dosages based on the new CDC
guidelines, but they're not really
[SPEAKER_04]: offering their patients any alternative,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not a surprise that in states
where they have access, that patients are
[SPEAKER_04]: looking to cannabis as a potential
solution for their pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a clinician, where do you start?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a patient who's taking 50
milligrams of hydrocodone a day,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's that THC equivalent?
[SPEAKER_04]: What we did is we looked at the
literature.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that there's 5 milligrams of THC
can be about as effective as 30 milligrams
[SPEAKER_04]: of coding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went in to an equal analgesic chart
and crunched the numbers so that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: get an idea of some of the potential max
doses of THC that a patient may need to
[SPEAKER_04]: replace their opioids, depending on how
much they're on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not aware of any literature that
demonstrates CBD as an equal analgesic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So usually what I do in my practice is add
in CBD to help decrease some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: unwanted effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis use among seniors has
increased tenfold from 2007 to 2017.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll often go to other talks where I
hear people tell me that it's a myth that
[SPEAKER_04]: seniors are the fastest growing
demographic of cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of my patients are 75 and older.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never used it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never even smoked a joint in college
or high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they really are new to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're seeking relief from things
like anxiety, pain, insomnia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of barriers for them,
access, a lack of guidance and education,
[SPEAKER_04]: the stigma of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I currently have a patient I've been
treating for the last three years who was
[SPEAKER_04]: homebound as a result of her back pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since starting cannabis, she's now
able to travel again with her husband and
[SPEAKER_04]: get out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's back at the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: She got her life back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she comes and sees me every year for a
checkup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, Kathy, have you told your
adult children yet that you're using
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent my whole life telling them to say
no to drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, Kathy, they have to know you're
doing better, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't they asking you what's different?
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, what do you tell them?
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, I tell them I do alternative
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how deep the stigma is for her.
[SPEAKER_04]: The shame is for her.
[SPEAKER_04]: She won't even have these open
conversations with her adult children.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm from California.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen an increase in the price as
much as 50% for some of these products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I wanted to do was dive in deeper
to the data that I had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, because it's all handwritten,
I have to go in manually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I picked 50 female patients who came in
and they were suffering from chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also had reported anxiety,
depression, or sleep issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of those 50 patients, 33 of them were
cannabis-naive.
[SPEAKER_04]: The average number of prescriptions they
were on was about three.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we had one patient who was using as
many as eight, then about 10 patients were
[SPEAKER_04]: using five or more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of these 50 patients, we identified 11 of
them that had insomnia or sleep-related
[SPEAKER_04]: issues, either as a primary or secondary
diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had 36 patients who had a chronic
pain as a primary, secondary diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, again, remember, if somebody comes in
and sees me for a sleep issue,
[SPEAKER_04]: I may identify that their sleep is not,
they're not getting quality sleep because
[SPEAKER_04]: they're having pain issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the 36 patients, 16 of them had
osteoporosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 had neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me if I step back a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And about four patients had other
conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pain conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: 19 of these patients had anxiety or
depression as a primary or secondary
[SPEAKER_04]: diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other secondary diagnoses included
migraines, tremors, Parkinson's disease,
[SPEAKER_04]: Lyme's disease, and cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of those 50 patients, only six
patients reported no improvement with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 44 out of 50 felt that they got some
effects or relief with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five of them used a cannabis tincture and
one of them used a cannabis edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the patients who experienced
improvement, this is just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: a snapshot of the different types of
products they were using.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most were using a cannabis tincture.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of my senior patients prefer that
route of administration.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy for them to titrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a lot more control over their
dose and their experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three of them used a cannabis vaporizer
only.
[SPEAKER_04]: 13 of them had multiple routes of
administration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of us who have experienced pain
or helped people with pain know that
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes you need multiple methods to
help control the pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nine other had single routes of
administration or products like a topical,
[SPEAKER_04]: a tablet, or a capsule.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we asked them whether or not a
clinician provided treatment plan was
[SPEAKER_04]: effective for treating the primary or
secondary diagnosis, as I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: 44 out of 50 responded yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went ahead and looked to look at the
hours of sleep that patients reported
[SPEAKER_04]: prior to starting cannabis and on average
of 35 patients is about five and a half
[SPEAKER_04]: hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after starting cannabis, they're
reporting increased sleep of about 6.5
[SPEAKER_04]: hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, they weren't necessarily coming to
me for sleep, but we did notice overall
[SPEAKER_04]: that sleep improved.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've heard that multiple times
these last two days as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before pain, their pain score before
cannabis was 6.9 and 32 patients
[SPEAKER_04]: afterwards was 3.9.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really just want to highlight right
now and take an opportunity to highlight
[SPEAKER_04]: the role of the advanced practice nurse
and nurses in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard many conversations about
nurses in the last two days and I want you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys to know we're 3.9 million strong in
North America alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Numbers wise, we outnumber physicians five
to one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're missing an opportunity here in the
industry by not engaging nurses,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at the data that came out
of California for nurse practitioners,
[SPEAKER_04]: we actually have lower rates of
preventable hospitalizations,
[SPEAKER_04]: readmissions, emergency visits when
compared to physicians.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patients are more likely to receive
education and counseling from nurse
[SPEAKER_04]: practitioners than they are from their
physicians and we're less likely to
[SPEAKER_04]: prescribe opioids for pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the American Cannabis Nurses
Association and the incoming president of
[SPEAKER_04]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 1,300 members in 48 states and our
mission is to educate, collaborate and
[SPEAKER_04]: advocate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I encourage you all to know that we are
an ally and we're looking for strategic
[SPEAKER_04]: partnerships because it takes a lot of us
to get together and collaborate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I look at the research that I
have right now and the ways that I want to
[SPEAKER_04]: improve, here are some implications for
research that I would like to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we engage patients to maintain
follow-up appointments to help them
[SPEAKER_04]: eliminate pain medications and achieve
success?
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, the biggest barrier is cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to pay out of pocket for my
appointment and the cost of medicine and
[SPEAKER_04]: then any follow-up appointments.
[SPEAKER_04]: They struggle with the cost of the
medications, the fact that insurance
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't cover it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can get their gabapentin sometimes
for 50 cents for a month's supply,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we compete with that when a
tincture can be $70 before regulatory
[SPEAKER_04]: taxes that may last them a couple weeks?
[SPEAKER_04]: And can we measure success rates when
patients are working with clinicians
[SPEAKER_04]: directly versus going into a dispensary
first?
[SPEAKER_04]: What I found when I do speak with people
in the industry, particularly producers or
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries, they often tell me that
they're spending anywhere from 30 to 60
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes in a new senior patient who may be
coming to them about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, we have this opportunity here to
engage with clinicians, help reduce that
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of time that maybe some of the
staff is spending answering questions for
[SPEAKER_04]: their patients and get them on the right
track right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if we can find their medicine,
they have to take it daily, sometimes
[SPEAKER_04]: multiple times today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is where we want to be focusing on
is medicine for these patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a little bit of time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I have about eight minutes if
anybody has questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's a microphone in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if anybody has questions about the
data, our data scientist is here because I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't speak that language.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering when you're talking,
I wanted to expand a little bit further on
[SPEAKER_02]: engaging nurse practitioners and obviously
possibly educating nurse practitioners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Illinois is just coming on to be adult
use recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not really sure if there are any
networks that are all ready established in
[SPEAKER_02]: Illinois and if not, what or how would you
say to create this type of a network?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have the American Cannabis Nurses
Association.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have members in Illinois and
actually a couple of them are nurse
[SPEAKER_04]: practitioners.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by joining the organization,
you do get that network and that
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity to see what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's lots of educational opportunities
I can talk about offline with you so that
[SPEAKER_04]: you can start to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just got a quick one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Dr. Jillian Smith, a pain physician.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did you get the slide about the OME
cannabis conversion?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how did you come to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you're talking about the OMEs and
then the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: My charts?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we did is we looked at the,
we took the data from five milligrams of
[SPEAKER_04]: THC can be equal to 30 milligrams of
codeine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we went in and looked at a
standard equal analgesic chart with
[SPEAKER_04]: codeine and hydromorphone and oxycodone
and hydrocodone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did the math.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did you get that five to 30?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can give you the reference.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have it off the top of my head,
but yeah, it's, there's some literature
[SPEAKER_04]: out there on the five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what you're talking about,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was up there, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it was on my screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, what are you guys talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious if you could give some
clinical tips and pearls of how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: start the process with the older adult?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fortunate enough to have 45 minutes
with each new patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really I have them fill out a pretty
thorough health history beforehand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they come in, I want to know
their goals because I may look at their
[SPEAKER_04]: thing and think, oh, they're coming here
for pain, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're really coming here for sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, low and slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: The education helps them to feel less
anxious about it because they have a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I usually ask them that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your misconceptions or what are
your, what brought you to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you concerned about anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you hear that euphoria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I loved how Dr. Sulak addressed it
today because often I'll say to patients,
[SPEAKER_04]: would you like to feel better,
more relaxed, more communicative with your
[SPEAKER_04]: spouse?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and they're like, well,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, that's the euphoria from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they start to come around with
education and they get less scared about
[SPEAKER_04]: proceeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm a physician in Maryland and I work
with a nurse practitioner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm a big fan of nurse practitioners.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't everybody go crapping on doctors
in this room.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's collaborative.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not all cut from the same cloth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_07]: One comment and then a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: My comment is that I have a similar
practice cohort to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of elderly patients all fearful of
getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my main concern in them is
unsteadiness on their feet and falling.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm very cautious about dosing.
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is, why have I forgotten my
question?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw the talk this morning.
It's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The data doesn't support it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll check with you offline.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, bing, gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just so you know, they don't call it
dope for nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The average dose that most of my patients
are taking is about 2.5 to 10 milligrams
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty low.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I support the concerns about falling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Eloise.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is John Calvert.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had the privilege of being in the
cannabis industry going on nine years
[SPEAKER_06]: right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've also had the privilege for almost
two years and working with this wonderful
[SPEAKER_06]: lady up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're amazing, Eloise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And first, a statement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone that's in this room and
everyone's had the privilege of listening
[SPEAKER_06]: to Rafael and Sulak and all these
wonderful speakers here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The baseline is education.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the challenges that I have as my
business and our company is really getting
[SPEAKER_06]: the word out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Eloise is all about education.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's her middle name.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your initial also, Eloise.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's Anne.
[SPEAKER_04]: My middle name's Anne.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it takes dedication beyond anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're shaking your head.
[SPEAKER_06]: You damn well bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes education, but it takes a
commitment.
[SPEAKER_06]: You sign on for some sort of a seminar.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's over an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you sign on to take a webinar series
that lasts for hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes tremendous dedication.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Eloise, in your experience,
past experience, and going forward,
[SPEAKER_06]: could you list what you think are the top
three mechanisms, the ways, the wave in
[SPEAKER_06]: the magic wand, whatever it is,
what do you think the baseline in how to
[SPEAKER_06]: get the message out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like a huge question, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have sent it to me ahead of
time, too, so I could sound intelligent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think it's about collaboration and
coming together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope that I didn't come across like
we don't need physicians.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm very aware of that and
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need all of us together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it's the growers, the bud tenders,
the manufacturers, the clinicians,
[SPEAKER_04]: we are all here to help patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have to really continue to plant
those seeds, because not everybody's
[SPEAKER_04]: ready, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we come back and water it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we come back and water it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And eventually, the results are going to
speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people will naturally, like we're
seeing now, gravitate towards it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take it offline, because we have
nice people in line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of course, I think it's money well
spent.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about it offline, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'm managing this well.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about we go here?
Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for working with older
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: My question is about cannabis and how it
might help dementia.
[SPEAKER_08]: In our experience, cannabis really helps
dementia.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just a family caregiver turned
advocate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell us your experience working
with dementia?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the role that you have is really
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't say just.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because dementia is a very
challenging disease, as you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's another presentation I could do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really fortunate in California to work
with assisted living communities that will
[SPEAKER_04]: dispense cannabis under a written order by
the physician and myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to get a list of those people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have about three dozen patients right
now who are using cannabis for their
[SPEAKER_04]: agitation anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's dramatic, the results that we
see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a large dose or small dose?
[SPEAKER_04]: About two milligrams of THC for most.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few times a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, anywhere from one to four times
a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have 17 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: What route of administration is this based
on?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's oral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oral through the gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or tincture?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my experience, this is my disclaimer
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find that most oil-based tinctures
follow the pattern of ingestion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, through the gut.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
Thank you.
