[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for inviting me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to thank the coordinators of
this actually a very informative
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's been talk about all dementias
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'd like to do is maybe go through
a little bit more in dementia and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: it about and what's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then bring in on some of our studies
that we do at the Dent Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So disclosures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that's interesting is that
I have done research with Charlotte's Web
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at pharmacokinetics, but this
discussion is not about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest of it is work I do at the Dent
Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have about 100 ongoing studies right now
in the field of neurology and pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is our institute in Buffalo,
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a private institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence, we could do a lot of things at a
private institute that academic institutes
[SPEAKER_01]: are a little bit nervous about doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the largest in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see about 320,000 patients per year,
which is about 1,400 patients every day in
[SPEAKER_01]: the field of neurology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the cancer hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the chief of neuro-oncology for the
last 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an institute that I developed
about six, seven years ago in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically Budapest, Hungary,
with the idea that I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis research in Hungary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do it in America, so let's go to
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm of Hungarian descent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, it didn't work out
because the government is rather
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Europe has been a disappointment in
general when it comes to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: research, working out of countries like
Switzerland and Portugal, thinking that we
[SPEAKER_01]: could do research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it hasn't panned out as much as I
would like to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do research and other things there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the institute that I work at,
this is our numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number, actually, is 13,500 patients
who are on a medical cannabis program in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, we're in Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And New York State has rather rigid
precautions on how to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this data that we have on about 13,500,
as you can see, most patients have cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic pain, then cancer and
neuropathies, MS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, I'm going to also be talking
about dementia and what is dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had some discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a neurologist, my feeling is that
the first thing you have to see about
[SPEAKER_01]: dementia is reversible dementias.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have somebody with cognitive side
issues at any age.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to look for reversible dementias,
which are potentially treatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a list of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is called pseudo-depression of
dementia, when depression is a common
[SPEAKER_01]: finding in patients with cognitive
decline, especially stress-related
[SPEAKER_01]: disorders, hydrocephalus, alcohol,
space-occupying lesions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being a brain tumor specialist,
I'm very astute about these issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolic diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go down that list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the reversible dementias.
[SPEAKER_01]: After we rule that out, then we say,
well, what is dementia?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a global sudden onset of decline of
cognitive functions, resulting in impaired
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to perform daily activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: MCI, and there's about 6 million people in
the United States with dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 million have mild cognitive impairment,
which is some cognitive effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're still driving, going to work,
but they're coming up to you and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I have something not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we call those individuals MCI.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the majority of dementias,
80%, is due to Alzheimer's pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alois Alzheimer was actually a
psychiatrist, pathologist in Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wrote the first article on a
60-year-old called pre-senile dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: With pathologic conformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interesting history.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to bore you with the whole
thing, because I have to be on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But dementia is currently the seventh
leading cause of death in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2019, dementia cost about $1.3 trillion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Approximately 50% of those costs are
attributable to informal carers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people who are taking care of that with
supervision, it's really a devastating
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody here in the audience knows
somebody, has somebody who's going through
[SPEAKER_01]: dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is one of the most saddening things you
can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody in your age, my age,
also has the fear what's going to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So women are disproportionately affected
by dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only directly, but indirectly,
because being caretakers historically,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been a major issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about types of dementia,
what's interesting, not many people know
[SPEAKER_01]: this, that 60, 70% of dementia is actually
Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_01]: By pathology, by presentation,
by imaging, by neuropsychometric testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what one doesn't know, by the age of
75, even if you're normal, 35 to 40% of
[SPEAKER_01]: people have pathologic changes of senile
plaques, of neurofibrillary tangles in the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain, even though you may not have
manifestations of that disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's frontal temporal dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to call that PICS disease for the
older physicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lewy body, vascular dementia, and mixed
dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm also a neurologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of research in imaging of
neurological diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's Alzheimer's disease, where
classically, you'll have pridolob and
[SPEAKER_01]: temporolob decrease in fluoridoxyglucose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Alzheimer's really is medial,
temporal, hippocampal, and pridolobia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's speck scat, which is a poor
man's pet scat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Alzheimer's disease, now we have
amyloid pet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the amyloid accumulation on
these cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is normal, this is abnormal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we do have studies in vivo,
premortem, to look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the classic progressive
aphasia, similar to what a movie star has
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, suffering from aphasic
dementia, where you have left dominant
tendons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temporal lobe atrophy compared to the
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can see the atrophy in the
frontal lobe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's different variations of this
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is vascular disease, just to show
you what multi-infarct dementia,
[SPEAKER_01]: due to multiple strokes, could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sub-critical dementia, but still a
dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the strokes, which on FLAIR study
is quite bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the continuum of Alzheimer's disease,
pre-clinical, the pathology is present,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's no clinical symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 70, 80-year-olds, for whatever
reason, they pass away from motor vehicle
[SPEAKER_01]: accident, you'll see pathology consistent
with Alzheimer's disease that's
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-clinical.
[SPEAKER_01]: MCI due to Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are objective cognitive deficits,
no meaningful compromise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have mild, moderate,
and severe dementias.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're severe, even moderate,
then unfortunately there's not many things
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do except palliative care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, as you know, nursing homes
tend to have a tendency to overutilize
[SPEAKER_01]: very aggressive medications, which
increases the morbidity and mortality of
[SPEAKER_01]: these elderly patients by putting them on
major tranquilizers such as Seroquel,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is common practice in nursing home,
agitated Seroquel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them on Seroquel, sedate it,
aspiration pneumonia, they die.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit like a hospice care,
where they're terminal, felt to be
[SPEAKER_01]: terminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The average lifespan of an Alzheimer
patient is about four to eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: MCI mild dementia, 4.6, that's close to
the six million.
[SPEAKER_01]: MCI is about 12 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the real problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do practice medicine in Europe,
and they have the same numbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: same issues, where Alzheimer's disease is
becoming probably the most devastating
[SPEAKER_01]: disease in the next 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that reason, research has been
focused on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we're looking at,
amyloid beta and neurofibrillary tangles
[SPEAKER_01]: that you see here, distinct in certain
locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you could have that in normal people,
but it really is the frequency and the
[SPEAKER_01]: location, hippocampal, amygdala,
mesotemporal lobe, cingulate gyrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the most common places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently, amyloid beta and TAL,
I have biomarkers that you can check for
[SPEAKER_01]: in the CSF for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now treatments, I'm gonna just give this
one slide because people heard that Biogen
[SPEAKER_01]: came out with this drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people were quite upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cost about $40,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the benefits of the drug were really
marginal at best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the complication rate was about 35%.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had area edema, and they had also
micro hemorrhages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this drug was taken off by Biogen,
by the way, after criticism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now this drug has been approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of other drugs we are studying at
our institute for the treatment of a
[SPEAKER_01]: disease which up to now had no treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can cannabis be a potential
treatment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is a study we did several years
ago, just looking at patients from 75 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 103.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did about 141 patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gave them, under the New York State
Medical Marijuana Program, we gave them
[SPEAKER_01]: either the 20 to one or kemovar one,
two, or three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of the day,
we looked at this patient population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got a lot of media exposure all
around the world because they highlighted
[SPEAKER_01]: it as grandma, grandpa do well on pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some kind of catchy phrase.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 69% of patients reported symptomatic
relief, chronic pain, neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying anything new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Sulak really summarized it well about
the positive effects in regards to pain
[SPEAKER_01]: and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: 31 or 34% reported side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those side effects were really
minimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And few of those patients came off study
because of side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was a very positive looking at
this LD geriatric population, which by
[SPEAKER_01]: definition already has neurofibrillary
tangles, already has beta amyloid plaques
[SPEAKER_01]: pathologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's most important is this number
down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: 32% of patients really came off that now
my practice is purely medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do recreational marijuana even
though it's proved in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this 80 year old rheumatoid
arthritis who does not want to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody understands that
perception here in this group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So treatment option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why is cannabis so interesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anti-inflammatory, it's
neuroprotective, antioxidant, and pain
[SPEAKER_01]: relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking of going to the basic
biology or chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've had that talk already today several
times and yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: But postmortem studies also shown that
patients who suffer from Alzheimer's
[SPEAKER_01]: disease have low levels of anandamide,
which is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the endocannabinoid deficiency
syndrome is described by Ethan Russo and
[SPEAKER_01]: lecturers today is very interesting
because we never thought of Alzheimer's
[SPEAKER_01]: disease having low anandamide levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a deficiency syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do lecture that a lot of neurological
disorders are deficiency syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me give you an example of depression
and anxiety, deficiency in norepinephrine
[SPEAKER_01]: and serotonin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parkinson's disease is a deficiency in
dopamine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alzheimer's disease is a deficiency in
cetocholine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are deficiency syndrome that we
treat routinely and never thought that
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide may be an issue here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of the advantages of
cannabinoids terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do forget about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But terpenes are very important in many
ways because, for example, the most common
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene, mersene, is a very sedating drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wrote an article with Pacific
Research Institute about the use of purely
[SPEAKER_01]: mersene in drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we blame THC for people who drive five
miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reality is the study showed that
mersene is far more sedating statistically
[SPEAKER_01]: in drivers with effect at driving
simulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was recently published,
just on mersene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have to strongly consider
terpenes as an issue here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for patients with migraines who are
agitated, THC, CBD, obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: dose-dependent anxiety, psychosis,
I do agree that I do use THC in patients
[SPEAKER_01]: with schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dose-dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's a contraindication.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBD more often in psychosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insomnia, I would put mersene up there,
anorexia.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the side effects in dementia
patients is they gain weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my mind, that's good because patients
with chronic dementia lose weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aggression, depression, pain, memory,
and all these things, you see these
[SPEAKER_01]: advantages of different compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the article that's outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna go through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a retrospective study.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually saw 180-some patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we looked at different variations
of potential side effects as things that
[SPEAKER_01]: may help their quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, out of the 180-some
patients, we found 116 meeting the
[SPEAKER_01]: criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: 65% of patients reported symptomatic
improved pain and sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15% reported which resolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really didn't have a person come off
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reductions in traditional pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very important because a lot of
these patients came off drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have been major tranquilizers,
risperidol, Seroquel for agitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those patients had a slower rate of
decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not see any changes at five or six
months between the middle mental state
[SPEAKER_01]: examination, meaning mental test,
or Montreal test for memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not see any deterioration of the
cognition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Demographics, this is the demographics.
[SPEAKER_01]: 57% were female, 43% male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the report improvement,
as you can tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pain, sleep, quality of life issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Undoubtedly, the family members felt there
was significant improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reported address of X, increased appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then cognitive difficulty,
which was really vague.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really not cognitive difficulty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most patients did not come off study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So decreased appetite, report side
effects, fatigue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one asked, what did we use?
[SPEAKER_01]: We used chemovar type 1 in 44% of
patients, and chemovar type 2 in 37% of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the average dose is up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC 8.5, CBD 7.8 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think this is the most important
thing, especially in today's world,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in my world, which is
hospital-based evaluations, ER evaluations
[SPEAKER_01]: of fentanyl oversupply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we noticed that in reduction of
opiate, in the chronic migraine
[SPEAKER_01]: population, which we published,
50% had a significant, at least 50%
[SPEAKER_01]: complete reduction in opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trigeminal neurology, if you know what
that is, that's a very painful syndrome in
[SPEAKER_01]: the geriatric population.
[SPEAKER_01]: 43% came off their opioids, a 50%
decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: elderly was 32%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parkinson's was 48%.
[SPEAKER_01]: MS was 38%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Concussion, post-traumatic head injury,
38%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is a statistic in regard to
Caucasians was African American.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the total number, when added,
163 over 490.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody comes off that, but it's a
very enlightening number, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: today's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have over 120,000 patients a year dying
from fentanyl overdose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, whether the tinctures, capsules,
veins maintain a value, ratio 1 to 1 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 21, the patients report improvement
independent on the ratio, 39, in our
[SPEAKER_01]: study, anyhow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reported side effects of patients were
minimal with fatigue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Side effects largely subsided.
[SPEAKER_01]: No statistical significant incognitive
deterioration, which is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results on the death site show
that medical cannabis is well tolerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are concerns regarding the cognitive
impacts and use of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there's treatment option.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, I have no inadequate science
to say that medical marijuana or cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is effective in the progression of the
underlying disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beta amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles,
there's not enough studies to confirm
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As say, I published an article on
Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one out there on ALS also.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to quality of life,
unequivocally, it's been helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: While cannabis may offer symptomatic
relief and comorbidities of Alzheimer's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is not a substitute for evidence-based
medical treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I should qualify that, because one
could critique the evidence-based
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just before I got on stage, I got a call
about an Alzheimer patient who is having
[SPEAKER_01]: problems with the use of two of the drugs
that I use often for the treatment of
[SPEAKER_01]: Alzheimer's, which in this case,
was Aricept and Namenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are acetylcholine esterase
inhibitors to increase the acetylcholine
[SPEAKER_01]: in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just don't tolerate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure what the efficacy is,
but since the last 15 years, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: only drugs we were able to give the
Alzheimer patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we have these new monoclonal
antibodies, the world may change,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still, any patient presenting you with
moderate to severe dementia, it's just too
[SPEAKER_01]: late.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way to treat these individuals is
catch them early, probably in the MCI
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Confirm that by spinal taps, PET scanning,
preferably amyloid PET scanning,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also neuropsychometric testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's premature to conclude that cannabis
is a better treatment often for
[SPEAKER_01]: Alzheimer's disease compared to the
medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, in nursing homes,
if you want to help somebody along in
[SPEAKER_01]: their course of life, you put them on
heavy tranquilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because after you put them on heavy
tranquilizers, their morbidity and
[SPEAKER_01]: mortality will increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to real fast, I have chronic
traumatic injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also was asked by the NFL to give them a
talk about CTE and use of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a few years before they changed
the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caused by repeated severe concussions,
you know a lot of the media is focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these pro athletes have committed
suicide, offered their brain for
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluation by a well-known pathologist in
Boston, damaged debris cells, military
[SPEAKER_01]: personnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's called chronic traumatic
encephalopathies and advancing
[SPEAKER_01]: neurodegenerative disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is abundance of hyperphospholated tau
protein, which is similar to Alzheimer's
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, this is just a diagram of the
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are tauopathies, Alzheimer's,
corticobasal degeneration, frontal
[SPEAKER_01]: temporal dementia, PICS disease,
CTE, and PSB, which is also called
[SPEAKER_01]: Richardson's steel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is again, I didn't get into the
basics, but THC does reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: presynaptic release of glutamate,
which is excitatory, which happens after
[SPEAKER_01]: traumatic brain injury, reduce
post-traumatic calcified influx in the
[SPEAKER_01]: MDR, regulate signal pathways,
and CBD inhibits the breakdown of our
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid independent receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulate intracellular calcifying through
the mitochondria and anti-inflammatory and
[SPEAKER_01]: so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some theories why we should
be able to use THC, CBD, and the in
[SPEAKER_01]: patients with degenerative neurological
disease, not just Alzheimer's disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Parkinson's disease, ALS,
post-traumatic brain injury, and CTE.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neuroprotective cannabinoids, modulation
of intercranial calcium levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: radical oxygen species, modulation of
apoptosis, stabilizing mitochondrial
[SPEAKER_01]: membranes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go through all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this was discussed in the previous
meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a slide summarizing these
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one of the things I've done is as a
physician who lived in the world of
[SPEAKER_01]: academic medicine, being a professor for
many years in neurology and oncology,
[SPEAKER_01]: I took it upon myself in a world of,
because a problem we had that we have is
[SPEAKER_01]: not Dr. Russo, Dr. Sirloch, Dr. Goldstein,
that's not the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the gods of cannabis research and
science and treatment of human beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is our medical societies,
who are very conservative, and in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look at each medical society you
may belong in, the exception may be the
[SPEAKER_01]: nurses, who are really forward-thinking
individuals, and think out of the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, yeah, yeah, you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is, our societies are so
conservative that on their website they
[SPEAKER_01]: say, you know what, they should schedule
it, we agree with that, we think there's
[SPEAKER_01]: potential, but you shouldn't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always ends up, you should not be using
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because not enough science, not enough
randomized studies, even though we know
[SPEAKER_01]: about the politics and the history of
cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've done is, I've lobbied in
Washington, go down there every year,
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to Schumer, talk to Pelosi,
tell them that why do we need to have
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in our medical armamentarium to
treat human beings and suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's always a difficult job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You waste three days down in Washington,
you gotta get dressed up like an idiot
[SPEAKER_01]: with a green bow tie, because that's
neurology, green bow ties, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: why, and walk around in a pseudo tuxedo
talking to politicians who give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: nanosecond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is very important, because it's
really, we have to change medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: not here, not with us, but at the medical
societies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once they're on board,
and we all know why they're upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're upset because people in Colorado,
patients and children, changed the
[SPEAKER_01]: politics of cannabis by bypassing the
medical societies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went right to the politicians,
politicians saw a obvious benefit to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something, and all of a sudden,
the medical societies say, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: wait a minute, back off, not enough
randomized studies, and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a real problem, and that's why
when I got involved, I tried to legitimize
[SPEAKER_01]: the process, which was not always so
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned that I don't have any issues
in regard to my talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the only one I just put in at the
last moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a discussion with Dr. Russo,
and the question here is, does the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacokinetics of a new drug with
nanotechnology help in the absorption in
[SPEAKER_01]: C-max, T-max?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I plan to do is look at this new
crossover delivery system and see if it
[SPEAKER_01]: helps our patients in different
neurological disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, I'm going to look at
migraine for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd like to thank you,
and I'd also like to thank my team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm five minutes early, because I was 10
minutes late in the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for allowing me to come back here
today, I wanted to say that you were
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to play some song about gods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed that there's three gods here
that I know well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Russo is Zeus, the god of gods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie Goldstein is Athena, the god of
wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Serlak, Dustin, is Aphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has four kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not shake his hand, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: He has four beautiful children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for allowing me to be
here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
