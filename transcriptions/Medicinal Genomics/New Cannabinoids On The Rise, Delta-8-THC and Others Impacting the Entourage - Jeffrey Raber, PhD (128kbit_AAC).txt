[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certainly a cannabinoid fan,
probably more well known for my interest
[SPEAKER_01]: in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, fully, wholeheartedly
embracing the entourage and ensemble
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all of them are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: More of them together are probably more
efficacious than one by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today I'm going to talk a little bit
more about what we're seeing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid space, predominantly in the
hemp-derived cannabinoid space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we know, there are many different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly won't try and cover all of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's the major actors and some of
the more emerging ones, like Ethan was
[SPEAKER_01]: just highlighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the more common minor ones,
like he had mentioned, CBG, CBGA,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBN, and THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're starting to see in the
marketplace, which I will highlight as a
[SPEAKER_01]: highly unregulated marketplace,
I will definitely echo Ethan's
[SPEAKER_01]: frustrations and concerns with
legislators, lawmakers, and regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science moves at a much more rapid pace
than any of them seem to be able to do so,
[SPEAKER_01]: despite our yelling at them, screaming at
them, trying to converse with them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really adamantly talking to them just
time and time again about problems that we
[SPEAKER_01]: may see coming as science and technology
advances much more rapidly than the law
[SPEAKER_01]: and regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're seeing today are more of
these hemp-derived cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 2018 Farm Bill put the lovely word
derivative in the language.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it started to light up saying,
how might we derivatize some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules?
[SPEAKER_01]: What might this open or entail?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're seeing today are some of
the ones listed on the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to not have to pronounce every
single one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there certainly is a large plethora of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lettering and the numbering and
naming start to get rather dizzying even
[SPEAKER_01]: for a chemist such as myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can appreciate the lawmaker and
regulator position when they say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I failed math and science in high school
and didn't even take much of it in
[SPEAKER_01]: college.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what am I supposed to do about trying
to write legislation or regulation around
[SPEAKER_01]: these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to comfort them and say,
here's some copy-paste language.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sometimes goes over well, sometimes
does not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they hear from everyone in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, there are some folks
with very strong lobbying efforts,
[SPEAKER_01]: very large amounts of financial resources
that can keep getting the conversations
[SPEAKER_01]: time and time again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are saying, there's no problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please let things persist as is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the absence of regulation,
we have seen that in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there are purity problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are mislabeling problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are all sorts of issues that arise
that are not to the benefit of a consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: and especially not to the benefit of
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't continue to operate in a space
with no laws that are clear and no
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations that are really helping to
define how these products should be
[SPEAKER_01]: produced and managed and introduced to the
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a small problem here as a
chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an old numbering system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this shows the numbering systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just highlight the three and the
four, because the numbering system around
[SPEAKER_01]: the ring changes into what we see today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the more modern numbering
system based on some technical chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: positions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're familiar with what's up here as
shown as delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see around the ring structure
here, there are many isomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where you get delta 8 when you go
and move the double bond from 9 to 10 to 8
[SPEAKER_01]: to 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many other derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pretty much walk that double bond
all the way around the ring and see one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those is probably out there in some
fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are more thermodynamically
favorable to form or produce than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some might be much more easily
accessible than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain derivatives are probably more
plentiful because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the physical nature of
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are also seeing derivatization on the
phenolic OH by acetylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So forming acetates, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have that as another functional
point in the molecule that we can see
[SPEAKER_01]: derivatization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other aspects of some of these
compounds that are out here are aliphatic
[SPEAKER_01]: chain lengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just heard about THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when the chain length is shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also some other ones out there
in the marketplace now where the chain
[SPEAKER_01]: length is longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to try and describe a little
bit of each of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look around the ring up here,
you'll see the isomer such as delta 8,
[SPEAKER_01]: delta 10, delta 7, delta 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where it's the little funny
part, delta 3 or delta 4, which would be
[SPEAKER_01]: the 10A or 6A positions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number is where the double bond
starts just for the nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can make delta 8 THC from delta 9
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also make pretty much any of these
from CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hemp farmers overproduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot more hype and interest in
cultivating CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very easy to manufacture and isolate
CBD isolate in high purity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD is a solid that's very friendly
from a manufacturing standpoint to isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: with high purity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can recrystallize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get it to come out and filter it.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, delta 9 THC by itself, is a highly
viscous sticky oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have the ability to
recrystallize it or make it a high purity
[SPEAKER_01]: solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to distill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often there are a few other either
minor cannabinoids or other components
[SPEAKER_01]: that go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see typical THC purity in the
marketplace in the 90s, 85 to 90%,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes a little over 90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't see the same purity as you
can with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can get CBD at 99 plus percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely cost-effective as a
chemical synthon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that that's out there, the current
estimates that we're hearing are about 75%
[SPEAKER_01]: of the CBD in the marketplace is being
derivatized to delta 8 or even delta 9
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending upon how you try and control the
chemistry, you can get the cyclization to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen, and you can land at delta 9 or
delta 8 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So poor farmers had to get rid of their
compounds in some fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had overproduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see this rise in delta 8 THC types
of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's the molecules sometimes
that we should think could be demonized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think delta 9 obviously we know much
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 8 I think has wonderful
physiological properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's great potential for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit akin to a hybrid between
delta 9 THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slightly lower psychoactivity potentials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be very beneficial for some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some folks are saying it's their
medicine of choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we know a little bit more about
that one than some of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: derivatives from medicinal chemistry
studies or other types of pharmacophore
[SPEAKER_01]: perspectives that the pharmaceutical
industry has performed over many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite as studied as delta 9,
but I'm a little bit more of a fan of
[SPEAKER_01]: delta 8 than some of the other
derivatives, because we know a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more about it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question becomes what have I used to
make it, and what might be left with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the end purity of the product,
and are there any other cannabinoid or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid-like impurities, or are there
any of the reagents that were used in this
[SPEAKER_01]: type of transformation that might be
present as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was funny to kind of look back from
my perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: At UCLA in 2018 in CanMed, I presented
this exact slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the last slide in my slide set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: We penned a white paper on delta 8 THC in
2018 when we saw the farm bill language.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that this might be coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't quite expect it would be coming as
much as I've seen today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our concern then was what you see
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is going with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll call it a delta 8 product,
or someone will call it a delta 8 product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what else was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we saw in one sample in Oregon is
highlighted in orange, where you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: other things that are obviously
cannabinoid-like molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: A much better representation is the blue
line, where you have a little bit of CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll caution this is diode array
detection.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBN lights up a lot greater than the other
cannabinoids because of the wavelength
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're using when you do detection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a quantitative picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the unknowns are obviously much more
present in the orange sample than in the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is going with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was made in the manufacturing
process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Today in Oregon, the regulator has tried
to stop the introduction of delta 8 and
[SPEAKER_01]: other synthetic cannabinoids in their
regulated supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had found most delta 8 on their
marketplace was between 70% to 85%
[SPEAKER_01]: impurity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just begs the question,
what's the other 15% to 30%?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it an unknown cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it some other impurity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that could be highly
toxic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that may even be better
for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply because we don't know, we really
shouldn't permit those in the marketplace
[SPEAKER_01]: or in the product streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've tried to set up a system where we
might be able to introduce regulators
[SPEAKER_01]: approving a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's more of a sensible
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this molecule seems to be OK,
and we're OK with that being in the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace, then how has it been made?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we monitor that process and
know the impurities that go with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a major reason the FDA exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the absence of federal regulations
doing these types of things, which they do
[SPEAKER_01]: for pharmaceutical APIs all the time,
we're going to require state regulators to
[SPEAKER_01]: try and grapple with this problem or send
folks into the field to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Oregon has said, if you've got a new
dietary ingredient process, if you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: a molecule under grass status or
self-affirmed grass, then you might be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to say that process has been approved
in a federal sense, and that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable to introduce into the Oregon
regulated supply stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: They specifically carved out CBN as well
for some other reasons, but there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of CBN already in the marketplace,
and they think that that one might have
[SPEAKER_01]: been a little bit more acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a synthetic chemist, I don't know if
that's necessarily true, the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: methods to CBN, depending how you try and
get there, could actually create a large
[SPEAKER_01]: number of impurities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are kind of the two that I'm
maybe a little more worried about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some others I'm much more worried
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the HHC, the fully hydrogenated
version where there's no double bonds
[SPEAKER_01]: left, and CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these come from Delta-8 or Delta-9 and
hydrogenation.
[SPEAKER_01]: To perform hydrogenation, and quickly,
my background is a synthetic chemist,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm pretty well versed in these
manufacturing methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I performed hydrogenation methods myself
in graduate school.
[SPEAKER_01]: You require a catalyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's typically palladium or platinum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it can be some other exotic
metals that are used.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are really concerning as to what
levels of those are being left in the
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: No cannabis testing lab that I am aware of
is testing for trace palladium,
[SPEAKER_01]: platinum, or any catalytic reagents that
may be used in a hydrogenation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the FDA very tightly scrutinizes
hydrogenation methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very common last step in a lot of
APIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something that can be managed and is
watched, but you have to be very careful
[SPEAKER_01]: that your palladium catalyst is not stuck
to your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not leaching into your end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one here that I am aware of is
currently watching that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding the process and how we
get there, what of those reagents might be
[SPEAKER_01]: left in the product is really of great
concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the asterisks up there because
hydrogenation happens from the top or the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of the molecule, and you'll create
a chiral center here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have a right-hand, left-hand
type of problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely have different
physiological activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can have catastrophic types
of physiological activities, such as the
[SPEAKER_01]: case of thalidomide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding your enantiomers may be
very important as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you leave the double bond in delta 9
and delta 8, you don't have that racemate
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it starts walking around the ring,
you start to generate the problem as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have complex mixtures of
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to need much more advanced
analytical methodologies to discern what
[SPEAKER_01]: is this mixture over that mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them may have better medical
efficacy than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them may generate unwanted
toxicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really don't know, and I think it's
really more incumbent upon us to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's slow the train down a little bit and
start to understand, at least from a
[SPEAKER_01]: toxicological perspective, what are we
introducing into this grand human
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment today?
[SPEAKER_01]: The scientific train and manufacturing
abilities are greatly ahead of legislation
[SPEAKER_01]: and regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the structure of CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're probably far less concerned
about its physiological activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it doesn't cause potential
psychoactivities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's potentially OK from a
metabolic standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worry about HHC's metabolic abilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the metabolisms are allelic
oxidations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the double bond present to
facilitate oxidation and then eventual
[SPEAKER_01]: clearance from the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not aware of the metabolic fates of
HHC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they've been fully
studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it starts to make you question,
will this build up to toxic levels in the
[SPEAKER_01]: body?
[SPEAKER_01]: Might it become a problem if I chronically
use it over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly at larger and larger doses,
how much of an issue might it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're aware of complications with CBD and
liver potential toxicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're aware cannabinoids have to go
through the cytochrome to be metabolized
[SPEAKER_01]: and excreted.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens to ones that really may
potentially lock that system up or be very
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are still somewhat unknown
questions as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The acetates, I'm also not a significant
fan of.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some big problems with that in a
couple of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be acetylized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the industry and my toddlers,
keeping me up too late at night,
[SPEAKER_01]: got into me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's acetylate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Acetylized is not a word.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize for the error on the slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a simple chemical transformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to take the phenol,
boil it in acetic anhydride, and I can
[SPEAKER_01]: make an acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably even other acetates
that I might be able to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that starts to beg the question,
how many of those might be OK or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's akin to the manufacturing method of
taking morphine to heroin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that there are huge differences
in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now cross the blood-brain barrier in
various ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are great concerns about these
types of things being in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the bigger problem with this is we
now know phenolic acetates such as vitamin
[SPEAKER_01]: E acetate cause the cases of evali.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you heat these up to certain
temperatures, they'll degrade into a
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule called ketene, which is highly
reactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that caused significant lung abrasions
and problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these products inside of an inhalation
product could be catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a fan of allowing any of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they're not naturally
occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not found in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really don't make much sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're completely new molecular entities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably don't have great place inside of
our regulated supply stream right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have plenty of other good cannabinoids
to deal with that we're not tapping into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stick to the natural ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The aliphatic variants, the reason these
are starting to show up is because they
[SPEAKER_01]: improve their potency at CB1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they start to become much more
psychoactive and at least are touted as
[SPEAKER_01]: being 30 times stronger than THC itself
for THCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you get longer in the chain,
you can start to see that increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a length limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts to decrease as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is why you'll start to see six,
seven, and eight carbon lengths greater
[SPEAKER_01]: than the THC one that has five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing some of the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have some of these present at 0.1%
in hemp, it might take you $10,000 worth
[SPEAKER_01]: of raw material to produce a kilo of
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's before you go about doing the
manufacturing methods or isolations to go
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead and bring these products to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they're selling for $8,000,
$9,000, $10,000 a kilo, it doesn't make me
[SPEAKER_01]: think that they're being derived from
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not aware of any hemp cultivars that
are actually present with appreciable
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of these molecules either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while they may have been found in trace
amounts, we have not used them in larger
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not putting 80% of those in
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to venture into a realm
where these are not really understood or
[SPEAKER_01]: well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I believe these are probably
more than likely being synthetically
[SPEAKER_01]: derived and not being extracted from hemp,
although all the webpages will tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you see in the marketplace
today?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's frightening.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just start putting in THCH,
THCJD, THCO, just start looking up some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these websites, and you'll see some of
these products are throwing everything and
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in between to try and say,
my product's more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: My product's differentiated, and you can
buy them online.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no age gating systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hoping you have a credit card.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is fancy packaging, things that may
be attractive to children, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to blow back on the rest of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the poor licensed operators that have
been operating within the states,
[SPEAKER_01]: desperately trying to follow hundreds of
pages of regulations and complex laws,
[SPEAKER_01]: are being forced to combat folks that
don't pay the same taxes, don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: same regulations, don't have mandatory
scrutiny, can't lose their license,
[SPEAKER_01]: and don't even have to care what's on
their packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's exceptionally unfair.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not rewarding to those that have been
carving this difficult path for patients
[SPEAKER_01]: and other consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see products like this available at
what could be a gas station or a grocery
[SPEAKER_01]: store or anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned I have toddlers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have kids around me all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is of grave concern to me and to many
others like myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they available?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why can't we do something to stop it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we regulate it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a good shot at maybe a good
guess to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 9 THC, which we know is ranked as
number 6.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't compare directly KI values or
inhibitory constant values at CB1,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're not always done in the
same models.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not always done in all these
molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to take that, and with some
help from ChatGPT, who doesn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: science very well either, I just kept
trying to think it through, think it
[SPEAKER_01]: through, and think it through,
and came up with somewhat of a picture
[SPEAKER_01]: from a lot of anecdotal insights,
a lot of what folks will tell you or post
[SPEAKER_01]: online, and some of what we know from
general pharmacophoric structures,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of what we understand from actual
use within the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not etched in stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to start conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is what the regulators
may need to say, how do we start
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't say no to all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely want some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Naturally occurring ones, that seems OK,
unless they seem to be too potent or not
[SPEAKER_01]: actually being isolated from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The approved column is saying the
regulator should approve the process,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the molecule might be OK,
but how did you get there is of more
[SPEAKER_01]: concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think that there's a lot to
be had in a complex slide like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of questions that are arising.
[SPEAKER_01]: But lawmakers and regulators especially in
California today are trying to figure out,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do I grapple with this problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: What should I allow or not allow?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure the federal regulators and
lawmakers are thinking about it with
[SPEAKER_01]: rewriting the farm bill this year as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, again, is not etched in stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some question marks here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those are naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cannabinoid acids don't have
the potency problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you say all cannabinoid acids are
allowed, we'll start to make the acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they'll decarboxylate them at
home in inhalation devices, and you might
[SPEAKER_01]: have the same problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very sticky, wicked,
and challenging problem with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular and technical complexities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's one, I think, that is present
upon us today and one that we have to take
[SPEAKER_01]: upon ourselves to really work together and
say, how can we best regulate these to
[SPEAKER_01]: allow the molecules that are beneficial to
patients, good for consumers, but at the
[SPEAKER_01]: right purity and potencies, and labeled
properly so that we aren't harming anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: inadvertently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when they see they're tested,
they think they're tested for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just have to be conscious of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll take a question for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a wonderful talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I opening as a clinician.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know when the Avali thing happened,
it was like, we're not testing for the
[SPEAKER_04]: vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm curious, do you think there's
going to be any work this year with the
[SPEAKER_04]: farm bill since we're coming up on the
five-year anniversary?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what I'm seeing now is in the hemp
marketplace, THC at 5 to 10 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp drive THC, which in some ways as a
clinician, I appreciate because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: easily accessible for patients in states
that don't have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I see this talk and I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think there's any talks right
now about the hemp bill?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any insights around that and
changes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are a lot of folks talking
about the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's an effort towards aiming
to regulate THC amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the farm bill says 0.3 weight percent
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was meant for biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for manufactured products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I make a granola bar or a
brownie or a chocolate bar and I say it's
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.3 weight percent THC, I can have
potencies and products that are much
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger than what's allowed in the
regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a simple math game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just make the product bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, I've got 30 or 300
milligrams in one unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want anyone getting that at a gas
station.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was not the intent, I think,
of the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just didn't know what they were
writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the absence of regulations,
everybody points to 0.3 weight percent,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is why they think there's some legal
precedent to allow them to have those
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEA is like, we don't think that was
the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've kind of said, HHS has said,
hey, you guys need to regulate this or
[SPEAKER_01]: take some sort of look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think everyone's aware of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they hopefully will come out with a
total milligram allowance in hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that you can analytically test
for, something that you could monitor and
[SPEAKER_01]: label properly, and something that doesn't
hurt all the legal state operators on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 9 THC side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you won't know until the last second
when someone finally says, OK,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bill's going to pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: From one organic chemist to the other,
how do they make THCP and the other
[SPEAKER_03]: aliphatic chain-link derivatives?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's quite hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Michelin have done with the
livitolic acid, and you just stick it
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take a livitol, but it's a derivative
of a livitol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the longer chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just stick it to the geranyl
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so you just resorcinol start at the
end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a simple synthetic process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no derivatization of CBDs,
but fully synthetic.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always, thank you for answering my
many texts and emails and learning from
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is about what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean to put you on the spot,
but there were two cases that were
[SPEAKER_00]: published in literature in December 22 of
a 20-year-old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a 35-year-old that were both
in separate cases, but presented to the
[SPEAKER_00]: same hospital with psychosis, suicidal
ideation, and what they called refractory
[SPEAKER_00]: depression after using Delta-8 products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it was in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question to you is, do we have any idea
which compound in this mix might be
[SPEAKER_00]: causing those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it more than one compound?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's the Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with you in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's the Delta-8 itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it may be, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't rule that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't find analytical data on the
products that they've had.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't allow anyone to really
scrutinize that for every other minor
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid or impurity that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does beg the question, was it the
impurities or something else in those
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing processes that caused that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Much like Spice and K2, we know if you
lock up the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have huge problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the concern with THCP and
some of the other ones when they're so
[SPEAKER_01]: strongly binding, you can lock the system
up and have catastrophic issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are some of these synthetic impurities
causing the same problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cannabinoid-like, so they could do
so, but in the absence of great analytical
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I kind of doubt those were the
only two people to take that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're seeing probably out of a
population, there's never 100% perfection
[SPEAKER_01]: in some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does beg the question, it's most
likely not Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably one of the other synthetic
impurities on how they got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe time for one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are the cannabinoids hemp-derived and
marijuana-derived the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all cannabis to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a scientist, it's cannabis sativa L.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it hemp or marijuana for legal and
tax definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just horrific from a scientific
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably to everyone in this room,
hemp-derived is saying I came from a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar that was high in CBD and low in
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana would be one that has higher
than 0.3 weight percent THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may also have some CBD in other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a chemist, all the molecules are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be more advantageous to go from one
that is higher in one cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_01]: expressed in a large amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have 20% CBD, isolating that CBD
is much easier from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But legally, I'm trying to call it
hemp-derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can skirt the state laws and I can
just go out there and sell it online.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you take it from a chemist point
of view to a business point of view,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's an economic factor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge economic piece.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeffrey, could I get one more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be meeting in Sacramento with
some of the state legislators for- Have
[SPEAKER_02]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've actually been really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some very good conversations with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of them want to hear some of
them are just like, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others are like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a crap shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was going to ask was like,
what is your short and sweet for when I
[SPEAKER_02]: meet them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've usually got about like 15
minutes and I'll visit several offices,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I get to talk to the chair people,
the committees that are seeing those bills
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to listen to the diverse array of
industry, not just one industry group.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if they are coalesced around a topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protect those that have state licenses
because they've been working so hard to do
[SPEAKER_01]: so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is, should we allow hemp
ingredients into California's regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: supply stream?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they're being tested and
labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the rules apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think pushing everything into a
cannabinoid centers of excellence,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we might eventually call these
dispensaries, makes more sense because
[SPEAKER_01]: people should be more informed about
cannabinoid, cannabinoid therapies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I'm kind of going to
expect I'll have these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't find something at a smoke
shop or a gas station with someone that
[SPEAKER_01]: just said, go buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's supposed to be the strongest
thing out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think putting it in a dispensary makes
much, much more sense just from a
[SPEAKER_01]: sociological standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what they were looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
