[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you believe we are just about 30 days
away from CanMed 23?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are really excited about this event,
and we have a lot of great things planned,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you haven't gotten your ticket yet,
do so now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have limited capacity at the venue this
year, and you don't want to miss out.
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed 23 will take place over three days
starting Monday, May 15th, when we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: holding four immersive professional
development workshops, including our
[SPEAKER_00]: full-day medical practicum, a cultivation
workshop focused on plant pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: a capital markets workshop focused on
funding cannabinoid innovation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a newly designed lab compliance
testing workshop that's all about potency
[SPEAKER_00]: inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday the 16th and Wednesday the 17th
will feature oral presentations that were
[SPEAKER_00]: curated by the CanMed advisory board that
cover topics like hoplite and viroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: the medicinal value of minor cannabinoids
and flavonoids, Delta-8 THC, and much
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have two amazing beach dinners
planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: On May 15th, the dinner will include a
tribute to Professor Rafael Machulam,
[SPEAKER_00]: who sadly passed away last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meal will include remarks from
Professor Lamir Hanus, Deddy Meary,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Brendan McKernan, the medicinal
genomics CEO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attendees will have the opportunity to
commemorate Professor Machulam during the
[SPEAKER_00]: special program planned for the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Hanus will also be presenting at
the May 16th dinner as well on the topic
[SPEAKER_00]: of how cannabis became a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we have packed a lot of
excellent content into this three-day
[SPEAKER_00]: summit and I haven't even mentioned the
world-class accommodations and amenities
[SPEAKER_00]: that attendees can enjoy at the Marriott
Marco Island Beach Resort.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information is at CanMedEvents
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go there today and I hope to see you in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this episode is Dr. Bonnie
Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnie is one of the country's most
respected and experienced medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians, having treated thousands of
patients with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the owner and medical director of
Canna Centers Wellness and Education.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the clinical advisor to
Canformatics, and she is the author of the
[SPEAKER_00]: book titled, Cannabis is Medicine,
How Medical Cannabis and CBD Are Healing
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from Anxiety to Chronic Pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed23, Bonnie is leading the medical
practicum and also presenting about minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids during the main session.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this episode, we dive into one of
those cannabinoids, CBG, also known as
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discuss the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes CBG one of Bonnie's favorite
new cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes CBG a bridge cannabinoid
between THC and CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between CBGA and CBG?
[SPEAKER_00]: How CBG enhances the body's natural
endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: How CBG works in combination with other
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Conditions for which CBG is a good fit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Potential adverse reactions to CBG?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bonnie also provides a preview of the
CanMed Medical Practicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Bonnie, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, the Dent Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: With more than 300,000 patient visits per
year, the Dent Neurologic Institute ranks
[SPEAKER_00]: among the largest neuroscience centers in
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its 24 subspecialty clinics often treat
the most challenging neurologic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, including but not limited to
migraines, chronic pain, ALS, MS,
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's, dementia, and neuro-oncology.
[SPEAKER_00]: With their mission of advancing
neuroscience, they established a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: clinic in 2016 to aid in the treatment of
those conditions seen throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information, check out
DentInstitute.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnie Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for having me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited to talk to you and have
you back on the podcast for the third
[SPEAKER_00]: time, which makes you the leader in CanMed
Coffee Talk podcast appearances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you may also hold the title
for CanMed appearances too, but I'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: to research and get back to you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, you're presenting yet
again at CanMed 23 about minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to discuss just one of those
compounds with you that you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: covering on the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we chose cannabigerol or CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watched a YouTube video you made
about CBG in preparation for the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time when you recorded it,
you said it was one of your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first question is, why is CBG one of
your favorites?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it appears to do a lot of things
that THC does and a lot of things that CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: does, but maybe a little bit better,
kind of the bridge between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not intoxicating or impairing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears that lower doses can be taken
for when comparing to CBD, it does appear
[SPEAKER_02]: to address some of the main issues that
people turn to cannabis for, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-inflammatory, pain relief,
anti-anxiety, even some sleep benefits
[SPEAKER_02]: have been reported, antidepressant,
also anti-cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like it checks all the boxes and maybe
lower doses and that non-impairing part
[SPEAKER_02]: will make it more acceptable to people who
either don't like that or don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: have the impairing part, but also don't
have the ability to pay for very high
[SPEAKER_02]: doses of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say it's a bridge between THC and CBD
because it is a precursor for those
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's it's parent compound CBGA is kind
of known as the mother to all the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids in that it is the compound
that's found in the immature, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis flower that then based on the
genetics of the plant and the enzymes that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's exposed to does change to CBDA,
which then turns to CBD with heat and
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA, which then turns to THC with heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBGA hasn't really been studied very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it is highly understudied and
I bet that we will find out that there are
[SPEAKER_02]: some very interesting anti-inflammatory,
probably anti-cancer properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know yet fully, but at least CBG
is being studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I constantly look at the
literature and just this year in 2023,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's already a study published from
Israel on how CBG may be helpful for
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's another study that looked
at CBG on how the mechanism of action
[SPEAKER_02]: works for pain and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of interest in it,
which is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, when I was watching that YouTube
video, there were there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different research that you that you went
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll put a link in the show
description so people can check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with so much promise for a lot of
different things, for what conditions do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think CBG maybe has the most promise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you most interested in?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think in again, going back to what I
mentioned previously, I think for people
[SPEAKER_02]: who struggle with inflammation,
pain, mood like sleep, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: like anxiety or depression, CBG holds a
lot of promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethan Risto did a survey along with some
other researchers and they published their
[SPEAKER_02]: results and they found that CBG and again,
this is just a survey of people using CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the first reports out there on
what are people finding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was highly rated for anxiety,
pain, depression and sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know that it's a direct sleep
agent, but when you are having less
[SPEAKER_02]: anxiety and less pain, you likely will
fall asleep a little bit easier and maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: sleep better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was highly rated by people over like
70% of people said it was superior to
[SPEAKER_02]: their conventional medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty high number, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that shows a lot of promise for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, in the research they have
found, and this goes back a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: years, they found that CBG did have
anti-anxiety properties in mice,
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-depressant properties, also
anti-inflammatory, pain relieving
[SPEAKER_02]: properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not something that people are
making up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some evidence to support that in
the preclinical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that survey that you mentioned,
is that CBG being taken by itself or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: in combination with other cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in the survey, they tried to sort
that out and it was people taking plant
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG that they buy in the kind of hemp
market because CBG most CBG products that
[SPEAKER_02]: are on the market do not contain a
significant amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are coming from hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they are readily available on the
hemp market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've seen it as flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it as topical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another point is that for
topical, it has antibacterial effects and
[SPEAKER_02]: it also has like anti what we call
psoriatic effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So psoriasis is a well-known condition
where people get not only joint pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they get skin like these plaques and
scales on their skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can really be very difficult condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And CBG has been found to have these anti
psoriatic properties in that it decreases
[SPEAKER_02]: the buildup of those scales.
[SPEAKER_02]: It acts on the skin cells themselves and
it inhibits the proliferation of those
[SPEAKER_02]: scaly skin cells, which is really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I think this just goes to show
the applications of cannabinoids is very
[SPEAKER_02]: widespread, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And people always say, well, how is it
possible that these compounds can do so
[SPEAKER_02]: many things, but they have multiple
targets in the brain and body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what makes them so amazing is
that there and remember the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: model is this medicine addresses this
specific target, whereas cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_02]: what we call promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of go to a lot of targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of brings up one of my next
questions is how does CBG differ in its
[SPEAKER_00]: targets than other cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they working on the same receptors
and, you know, kind of the same mechanisms
[SPEAKER_00]: of action as the other cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some overlap with some of the
other actions of let's say THC and CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then there's also some like opposite
reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like CBD and CBG have opposite
reactions at a specific serotonin
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor, the 5-HT1A, where CBD binds to
it and CBG blocks it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so again, they both act at that
receptor, but differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG also like overlaps with CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of binding to what we call
PPAR receptors, also at these what we call
[SPEAKER_02]: trip channels to help with inflammation
and pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: One interesting thing about CBG is it so
far is the only cannabinoid that has been
[SPEAKER_02]: found to work at the alpha adrenergic
receptor, which is a receptor well known.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually pharmaceuticals that
target that receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, importance for me is that
when you address that receptor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're addressing pain, inflammation,
and even, you know, that's a target for
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the medications for ADHD or for
behavior issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have used CBG in some of my
patients with autism and some families.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you have to remember that we're
all very similar, but we're different in
[SPEAKER_02]: the way we respond to compounds that we
put in our body.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you know people who can take
particular medication and other people,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they take it, they flip out,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people think it's the best thing
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other people say, I can't take that at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took one dose and I'll never take it
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have such a wide, such a, what's the
word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I guess, varied way that we respond
to medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, when I try it in patients,
like just this morning, I got an email
[SPEAKER_02]: from a family said CBG made their child
way too hyper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may be a dosing issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in other families, they're reporting
my child's calm, has better focus,
[SPEAKER_02]: even speech is improving in some of the
children with autism who are nonverbal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always a compound I consider when
I'm treating, you know, children who have
[SPEAKER_02]: either behavior or other types of
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not try it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that it's safe and it's under
medical supervision and we start with very
[SPEAKER_02]: low doses so that we can control what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, there's a lot of oversight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the parents are watching,
I'm watching, and we're just trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure, of course, do no harm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so far, you know, I'd say about 60% of
kids that try CBG seem to have some
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and I'm glad you brought up ADHD
because I guess, full disclosure,
[SPEAKER_00]: my son has been diagnosed with ADHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we first got that, I mean,
of course, being in the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, I looked up like, oh,
can cannabis help?
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the things that I found was
like, no, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of funny that, you know,
cannabis seems to help with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was sort of one of the few things
that I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I was doing research and I
watched the video about CBG and you
[SPEAKER_00]: brought that up, I was surprised to see
that CBG might be helpful for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we don't have clinical trials
to say, yes, this is a definitive benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: for children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or gentlemen, we just don't have the
trials yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think that we are on the cusp of
having those trials, which would be very
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, in my practice, which is in
California, I'm allowed to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: parents to try different cannabinoids,
right, to see what might help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do it very methodically.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in my book, I talk about rule it
in or rule it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we start low dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: We titrate up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We focus on that one compound to see what
are the benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, too, that sometimes when
we're seeing a benefit, it may be because
[SPEAKER_02]: the child's also on CBD and maybe for them
that combination is working well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you add a compound and see enhanced
benefits, you don't know if it's that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular compound or the combination of
the two, if they're already on something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's a lot of trial and
error, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also, again, it takes time to sort it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you know, I always tell patients when
I first or families when I first meet them
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're going to be working together
quite some time because there is no it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not like we just pick something and,
oh, yeah, it works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we may get lucky and that happens,
but that's not the usual case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that stood out to me,
too, was this this idea of CBG kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancing the body's endocannabinoid
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could speak a bit
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a number of endocannabinoids,
including CBD and CBG block the breakdown
[SPEAKER_02]: of our endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So remember, our endocannabinoids are our
inner cannabis like compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our body releases them on demand in
response to a trigger, usually something
[SPEAKER_02]: that is stressing us, whether it be an
illness, you know, like my famous saying
[SPEAKER_02]: is a bear chasing you in the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just anything that might stress you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inflammation illness, some traumatic
insult, an infection of some sort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your body cranks out these
endocannabinoids in order to help maintain
[SPEAKER_02]: balance of the messages that the cells are
sending.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's you have to remember the system,
the endocannabinoid system is a
[SPEAKER_02]: physiologic regulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just helping you stay in balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that promotes
[SPEAKER_02]: the enhancement of endocannabinoids in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, sometimes there are some detriments,
but in general, especially in someone
[SPEAKER_02]: who's ill, that can be helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by enhancing your own natural
endocannabinoid system, by blocking the
[SPEAKER_02]: breakdown of these endocannabinoids,
that means they last longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, you know, the way that
some antidepressants work is by blocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps enhance the way how long
serotonin is hanging.
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these compounds do this and it's
very hard to measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to know if it's something
that happens immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an overtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you see is you may notice,
and I hear this a lot from adult patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think I need as much cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not having as much anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sleeping better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that tells me that maybe cannabis kind
of augmented their natural endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system, what we call upregulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're kind of at a nice sweet spot
where they're just a little more balanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole concept behind,
you know, the idea of boosting the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system is to get yourself
into better balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, correct me if I'm wrong,
but another way to sort of spurn your body
[SPEAKER_00]: into creating endocannabinoids,
a stressor is exercise, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little experiment that I've been
doing, and I want to get your opinion on
[SPEAKER_00]: this is after exercise, supplementing with
whether it be CBD, CBG, would that be an
[SPEAKER_00]: effective way to sort of, you know,
keep anandamide in the system and get sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of the benefits from, from sort of our
natural cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, theoretically, you could,
you could look at it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that physiologically that
that's exactly what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning like, oh, I took a dose and now I
have extra anandamide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't think that there's a
direct correlation there, but I do think,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, I think the literature
supports this whole idea of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids being anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant, neuroprotective, and that one
[SPEAKER_02]: dose is not going to do the trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually a regimen that somebody like
a wellness regimen, if you're not terribly
[SPEAKER_02]: ill, that includes cannabinoids,
of course, in addition to other healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: things that you should be doing to enhance
your endocannabinoid system, which like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a healthy diet, good sleep,
trying to really control your stress,
[SPEAKER_02]: which, you know, is like a cycle,
you know, you use cannabis to control
[SPEAKER_02]: stress and stress makes it so that maybe
you don't need, if your stress is down,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't need so much cannabis,
but there's a cycle there that can be very
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it's, I certainly don't
think that it's, if I had to choose to
[SPEAKER_02]: give cannabis after exercise or not,
I would say, sure, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it certainly could be helpful in
recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep up my regimen time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also mentioned so that there is
some overlap with CBG and other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and there there's certain
receptors or certain mechanisms that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: are unique to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering if you could speak to,
you know, some examples where CBG sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: enhances the effects of other cannabinoids
or, you know, situations where you think
[SPEAKER_00]: the combination is useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in looking at the study,
so there's a study in 2019 that showed
[SPEAKER_02]: that the combination of CBD and CBG
decreased neuroinflammation, this is an
[SPEAKER_02]: animal study, but they were looking at
neurodegenerative disorders with dementia,
[SPEAKER_02]: what we call Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it showed in this preclinical study
that CBD and CBG worked together and gave
[SPEAKER_02]: better results for anti neuroinflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, remember this goes back to
the concept of the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is when the combinations of
cannabinoids and terpenes appear to
[SPEAKER_02]: enhance the benefits, enhance the positive
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's another study, I know I can't
remember what year it came out recently,
[SPEAKER_02]: that showed that CBG in addition to THC
and or CBD was anti-cancer in a model of
[SPEAKER_02]: or in test tube study looking at certain
brain tumor cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in some of my cancer patients,
you know, who come to me with advanced
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer, very poor prognosis, I,
and I've been doing this now for a number
[SPEAKER_02]: of years, I add in CBG to the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, to me, no harm in doing so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't cause, again, the impairment
that anti-cancer doses of THC can
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was going to ask you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just mentioned one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, what other scenarios or
situations do you encounter where you
[SPEAKER_00]: think, you know, CBG is either the right
tool for the job or might be a good kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of companion or, you know, if you're
already started a regiment and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: things you're not getting the right
results, you're thinking, oh, CBG might be
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question, because I think
that if you're trying to treat anxiety,
[SPEAKER_02]: pain, inflammation, and you are not
getting great results with either THC or
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD, which of course are the most,
two most common cannabinoids being used
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, certainly the addition of CBG
is worth a try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, too, that when you combine
cannabinoids, sometimes you can get away
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lower dose of either or both and
get that enhanced effect from that
[SPEAKER_02]: entourage, because there are studies that
show that subtherapeutic doses,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning doses not expected to do anything
clinically, right, but when combined will
[SPEAKER_02]: work better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have had patients who say rather
than take, let's say, 300 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD for my anxiety, which people might
like look at that and say, wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a really high dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you look at the studies,
those are the doses that are being used in
[SPEAKER_02]: studies to get a true effect, right,
to be able to find a true effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, too, there's some placebo
effect if I'm taking CBD and it's supposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to decrease, let's say, my pain and
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have less pain and anxiety because
I'm actively doing something about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't poo-poo that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just say, you know, for a lot of people,
high, high doses just is not financially
[SPEAKER_02]: feasible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes that combination of two
compounds in what we consider
[SPEAKER_02]: subtherapeutic doses, but in that
combination will work better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, the things that I would
recommend CBG for, anxiety, pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: psoriasis, I use it in my patients with
autism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it in my patients with cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, I think the future,
like so this study that came out this year
[SPEAKER_02]: on multiple sclerosis, is that something
now we should be trying in our patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, that's an animal study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're taking a leap.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, because it's safe, if
somebody's struggling and conventional
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine is not helping them, or it is
only helping them to a point, I don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: any reason, especially under medical
supervision, not to try cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically CBG now that there's some
research to support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's a good point to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like CBG is very well tolerated
by patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are there adverse reactions that you
typically run into?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't really seen a lot of adverse
reactions, except for a few kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: specific ones related to the population of
children that I take care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in some kids with autism, it's just too
overstimulating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes behavior go off the charts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have seen that numerous times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I do warn the families,
we're going to get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be a dose thing, that lower doses
might be overstimulating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we try higher doses, which
sometimes can be more calming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's specifically related to that
population.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not heard of too many side effects
from adults taking CBG, except for a few
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have had some patients say that it is
somewhat alerting, meaning it feels a
[SPEAKER_02]: little up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would not want to take that right
before bedtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: You figure out how you respond to it,
and then don't use it at night if that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the effect you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, on the other hand, some people say
it helps with sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe it's helping with sleep
because it's more calming and decreasing
[SPEAKER_02]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, your response, let's say 10
people get a similar response,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're the outlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say, well, what's wrong with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have a different chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get to get somebody's underlying
chemistry report before I treat them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody does.
[SPEAKER_02]: When a doctor hands you an antidepressant
or an opioid, nobody knows how you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to respond if you've not taken that
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a little bit of a risk when
you take a new medication that you may be
[SPEAKER_02]: the person who doesn't respond very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other hand, you might be the
person who gets a great result.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think that in that report by Dr.
Russo, I think there were some reports of
[SPEAKER_02]: dry mouth or some reports of feeling high
or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it goes back to what was in the
product that they were taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not report on the exact products
that patients were using.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always a matter of, well,
what else is in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And also dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dosing is very, very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just take some and think it's
going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should know what you're doing when
you're dosing it out in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's a good point about the
different products, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, CBG, it's one of the lesser
known cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are there a fair amount of products
available out there for folks to to get?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the video that I put up on YouTube,
I do have a slide that shows some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it as flour if you wanted to
vaporize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it as a topical, as I've
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly I've seen it in tincture form,
which means, you know, an extract in a
[SPEAKER_02]: bottle where you have a little eye dropper
or syringe and you measure out your dose
[SPEAKER_02]: and squirt it under your tongue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't endorse any company,
so I can't point anybody in any direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly a quick Google search,
I'm sure you can find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, always, always,
always you would before purchasing
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, you want to make sure that you
get what's called the certificate of
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis and you see that what is truly in
that bottle before you make a purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the certificate of analysis isn't
available or not readily transparent,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is, you know, move on to the next
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did a podcast with a
laboratory professional who was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how some manufacturers will even
falsify their COAs and we had some good
[SPEAKER_00]: tips in there for, you know, being able to
spot the real ones and maybe the less
[SPEAKER_00]: scrupulous ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll put a link to that one in the show
description too, because I think that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing for people to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bonnie, before I let you go first,
thank you so much for talking about CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: with us and look forward to hearing about
the other cannabinoids in your talk at
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also wanted to bring up that you're
also going to be leading our medical
[SPEAKER_00]: practicum at CanMed 23, along with Dustin
Sulak, Kevin Spielman and Eloise Thiessen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering if you could give us a
kind of a quick preview of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: of like what people can expect at the
practicum and why do you believe it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: important to have events like this to
educate clinicians and lay persons about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, answer the last question first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the importance is that there for health
care professionals, there is no like full
[SPEAKER_02]: board training program.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no residency or internship.
[SPEAKER_02]: We now do have some schools are offering
master's degrees and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think hearing from clinicians who
are actually practicing this medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: this type of specialty and working with
these medicines and really learning the
[SPEAKER_02]: nuances of them is very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the feedback we've gotten in
the past is having a kind of mentor
[SPEAKER_02]: clinician educate is really helpful to
build on the foundation of what you might
[SPEAKER_02]: be reading in the literature or in a book,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the practicum, it's a full day of
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we start off with endocannabinoid
system physiology, the physiology of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids and the other phyto
constituents of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to note Dr. Kevin
Spellman, who's a brilliant botanist,
[SPEAKER_02]: herbalist, years and years and years of
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his lecture is amazing, opens your
eyes, especially coming from my
[SPEAKER_02]: background, which is as an MD in the
allopathic world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big change for me to understand
botanical medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having him on board really helps
bridge that gap for those of us who are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from the allopathic field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we also go through special
consideration, well, clinical applications
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis and special considerations for
geriatric patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a talk on the chronic pain
treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about pediatrics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have practical panels where
we're going to be giving case reports and
[SPEAKER_02]: how to help your patients pick medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it's just a day chock full of
information for really anybody who wants
[SPEAKER_02]: to advance their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's a fantastic event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the highlight of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the collaboration that I
think is really great, too, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys get a lot of great questions from the
clinicians who are in the audience who
[SPEAKER_00]: are, again, sharing some of their
experiences and to see you guys sort of go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth and share that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to be around like minded people
and it's great to hear about other
[SPEAKER_02]: people's experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always learn something from my
colleagues, from people in the audience,
[SPEAKER_02]: from the other speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just for me, it's you know,
I walk away from CanMed every year saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: wow, that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope other people find it to be great
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Bonnie, again, before I let you
go, I know I just already said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one more thing, if you would like to
plug website, social media, anything so
[SPEAKER_00]: folks can learn more about you or get in
touch with you, please share away.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so I have my YouTube channel,
which you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Bonnie Goldstein MD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, there's no E at the end of
Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I do have an Instagram Bonnie
Goldstein MD as well, where I do try to
[SPEAKER_02]: remember to post.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't post very often, but I try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other than that, I really not don't
have like, you know, Twitter and all that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am on LinkedIn in case anybody wants to
connect with me through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about your social media here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're plenty busy as is Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you again for taking the time to
talk with me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait to see you down in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it'd be really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look forward to seeing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed my conversation with
Dr. Bonnie Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the links in the show
description to learn more about the topics
[SPEAKER_00]: we discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks again to this episode sponsor,
the Dent Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next episode drops April 26th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two weeks from today.

[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will find that not only does
our lineup include some of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: names in the industry, but they are also
addressing some of the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: topics, such as hoplite and viroid and
other plant pathogens, the efficacy of
[SPEAKER_00]: minor cannabinoids and compounds,
Delta 8 THC, lab shopping, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to miss out on this
opportunity to learn from and network with
[SPEAKER_00]: the leading minds in the industry at a
world-class resort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an amazing event,
and I hope to see you there.
