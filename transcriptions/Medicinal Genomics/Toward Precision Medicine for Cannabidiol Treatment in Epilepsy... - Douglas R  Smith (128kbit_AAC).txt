[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start off with just some
mention and thanks to my collaborators on
[SPEAKER_00]: this project, people at Cortigen,
NET, Christine, who runs our clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: group, and some of our bioinformatics
folks who helped analyze the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as our collaborators on the data
I'm going to talk about today,
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Marsh and Oren Devinsky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jose Dupuy is a statistical geneticist at
Boston University, and she helped on some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the analysis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kevin, who initiated the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have two parts to this
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, investigation of genetic factors that
influence response to cannabidiol for
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually looking at the same
group of patients that you just heard
[SPEAKER_00]: about from Elizabeth and Oren in this
open-label trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the things that we may have
found, there are some response differences
[SPEAKER_00]: in CDKL5 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients with mutations in that gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some regulatory SNPs in another
gene that may be associated with better
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second part, I'm going to
talk about rare variation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid system genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we've found rare variants in the
cannabinoid receptor type 1 and
[SPEAKER_00]: diacylglycerol lipase, which are
associated with neurological phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early on, we got involved with folks
running this trial, Oren and Eric Marsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently, we brought on other
collaborators who are also participating
[SPEAKER_00]: in this trial, the open-label trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've been doing is
essentially analyzing the DNA of the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who are in the trial and looking
for factors that are involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'll tell you about today are the
results from the first 75 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cortigen, our main sort of thing is
neurological testing, testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: neurological disorders, epilepsy and
seizure disorders, neurodevelopmental
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders, autism, mitochondrial and
functional disorders, a whole series of
[SPEAKER_00]: different gene panels, comprehensive
panels with large numbers of genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually whole exome sequencing as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the panel we used for this study is
called EpiSeq Comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has 471 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It covers the major epilepsy-associated
genes, GABA pathway genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We included in the panel from very early
on the major endocannabinoid system genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the CB1, CB2 receptor, daglifa,
and maglipase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also contains a number of
genes that are actually associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was more or less by accident,
but when we actually went through and
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzed a lot of data from a large number
of genes, we found that a list of genes
[SPEAKER_00]: there that when patients are either given
CB1 agonists or various other compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the activity of these genes or their
expression changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also includes genes involved in
drug metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we're looking for a
genotype-phenotype correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So significant variants are identified,
reviewed, and verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clinical data is considered in
relation to the patient's disease and the
[SPEAKER_00]: known effects of mutations in various
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we basically score the variants
on a five-point scale, so either from
[SPEAKER_00]: benign to pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many cases we're able to identify
what we call a driver variant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is simply a rare variant in a
particular gene that explains the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient's disease and phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from this study of the 75 patients,
we identified those types of driver
[SPEAKER_00]: variants in about 40, a little over 40% of
the patients, 32 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this actually shows kind of a
distribution of those driver variants that
[SPEAKER_00]: we identified in these patients with the
response curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each one, each bar there is a patient,
and it's the same kind of response diagram
[SPEAKER_00]: that Elizabeth showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the good response responders
are down here, and the poor responders are
[SPEAKER_00]: up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we actually look at the genes
across that spectrum of response,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see SCN1A pretty much covers the whole
range of responders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we know there's a good
response in Tervet patients, which have
[SPEAKER_00]: these SCN1A mutations, there's no actual
statistical correlation with the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of an SCN1A mutation and response.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, with CDKL5,
they kind of stack up towards the poor
[SPEAKER_00]: responding end of the spectrum,
and there are no really great responders
[SPEAKER_00]: that have CDKL5 mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not reaching significance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still above .05.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a possible indication,
and we need more data to really
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate this further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CDKL5 is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a protein kinase involved in
transcriptional modulation of synaptic
[SPEAKER_00]: plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process is dependent on NMDAR,
the NMDAR system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other genes in that pathway
that we know also are associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: refractile seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBA just may not influence this pathway as
strongly as other pathways, but obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: we need more data to look into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing I'll move to is
drug-drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard already that clobazam,
and this is a paper actually by Elizabeth
[SPEAKER_00]: Field's group, has an influence,
and that there's an interaction between
[SPEAKER_00]: clobazam and canhabidobazam.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked across these patients,
all 75 patients, and here you can see them
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of sorted by response again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the good responders are down here,
and the poor responders are up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually looked at the data that
was available for clobazam levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are the green dots across the
middle, and endosmethyl clobazam,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the blue dot, green dots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is limited data, so not all the data
is complete for these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do see, and this is reported in
the paper, there's most of the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: down at the good responding end happen to
also be taking clobazam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is clearly an interaction there
that's significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if you actually look at
the endosmethyl clobazam levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no correlation with the response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relative to the level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just simply a level of
endosmethyl clobazam or clobazam itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at the drug metabolism
variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this data set, we don't see anything
popping out in terms of that any one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these enzymes which influence the
metabolism of CBD is associated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: good response or a poor response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we have limited data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is early days from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this made me think, I mean,
clobazam and CBD, perhaps they act on the
[SPEAKER_00]: same pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clobazam's a 1,5 benzodiazepine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It targets the GABA receptor, particularly
the ones with alpha-2 subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of GABA signaling genes
involved in various epilepsy syndromes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps CBD acts on this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, there's a recent publication
that just came out in the Journal of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacological Research by Bakus et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: that shows that CBD is actually an
allosteric agonist of the GABA receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: and also prefers these subtypes that have
the alpha-2 subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an interesting finding,
and perhaps these things are both kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: working in an additive way in patients
that are receiving both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to shift and talk about
common genetic variants now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, these have all been about rare
variants that we've been seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take an approach of genome-wide
association studies to study common
[SPEAKER_00]: variation and its association with
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD study sample size is too small for
this, so what we are doing is using the
[SPEAKER_00]: data from the gene panel and essentially
taking the common variants which are
[SPEAKER_00]: nearby the exons of known genes and
looking there for a signal that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we took, we recalled all the data
so we had consistent variant calls on the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole data set, filtered the variants for
minor allele count and Hardy-Weinberg
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance, and then basically looked for
the allele distribution of individual
[SPEAKER_00]: variants and essentially testing for
correlation with response in that
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an initial pass at this back in 2015,
looking at the entire panel, there's about
[SPEAKER_00]: 6,000 variants, we immediately realized
that we had too many variants to reach a
[SPEAKER_00]: decent significance level for this data
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just looking at a very small fraction
of the data, we noticed that some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that we're seeing there are actually
genes that have some association with
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system and the response of
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we decided to do was focus in on
just the genes, there are 39 genes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: panel that are associated with the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I described earlier, either,
oops, that either bind cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_00]: have activity changes associated with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those genes are only about 8% of the
panel, but three out of four of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that we saw in this initial pass
were in that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought that was significant and we
should just focus in on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we repeated that analysis on the 75
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing one particular gene is
approaching the significance level that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still not enough data or enough patient
samples to give us a significance level,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is approaching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gene is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's glial fibrillary acidic protein,
which is involved in differentiation of
[SPEAKER_00]: astrocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, the CB1 and CB2 blockade
results in persistent overexpression of
[SPEAKER_00]: this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anandamide promotes neural precursor
cell differentiation into GFA-positive
[SPEAKER_00]: astroglial cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These variants that we're seeing,
they're at 11% minor allele frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a regulatory region that has
promoter elements and enhancer elements
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually changes messenger RNA levels
for a few different genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something going on there that
looks interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we haven't really reached the
significance level to say that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a response element at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to switch and talk about the
second part of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a separate study looking at
the core ECS genes in our panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just the epi-seq panel,
but also our so-called nuke-seq panel that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks at mitochondrial disease has these
genes include or a number of these genes
[SPEAKER_00]: included in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the CNR1, CNR2, those are the
two major receptors, FAA, which breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: down anandamide, maglipase, and
diacylglycerol lipase alpha, which
[SPEAKER_00]: produces 2AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we're doing is looking
for rare variants in these genes in a
[SPEAKER_00]: large data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since these genes were included in
these panels and we've been basically
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing, patient and delivering tests
for several years now on these same
[SPEAKER_00]: panels, we have large numbers of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over 3,800 epi-seq tests and 2,100
nuke-seq tests that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically what we do is just parse
out all the phenotypic terms for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cases where these variants were observed,
select terms that were present in at least
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 percent of those cases, and then if
there were some rare variants shared
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst those, we included those,
select a bunch of random controls that do
[SPEAKER_00]: not contain those variants, and just
perform a Fisher exact test to test for
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotypes present or absent in cases
versus controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did this, we did not see anything
significant for CNR2, FAA, or magl,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did for CNR1 and DAGLA,
and that's what I'm going to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, for instance, in CNR1,
we found 24 cases that had rare variants,
[SPEAKER_00]: rare potentially deleterious variants in
this gene, and looking at cases versus
[SPEAKER_00]: controls for migraine and headache,
we see significant association of the
[SPEAKER_00]: four-and-a-half-fold increase of migraine
and headache, same for sleep disorders,
[SPEAKER_00]: a larger increase associated with those
rare variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anxiety did not reach significance by
itself, but in combination with migraine
[SPEAKER_00]: or headache or sleep disorders,
it was very significant and a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think, you know, there are people
walking around out there who have these
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of rare variants in their CNR1 gene,
and this could be an explanation for part
[SPEAKER_00]: of this disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, so interestingly,
there were two out of six cases that had
[SPEAKER_00]: one particular variant that shared the
same variant, and they have combined sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance, anxiety, and abnormality of
the autonomous nervous system,
[SPEAKER_00]: completely unrelated patients with similar
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you knock out the CB1 gene in
mice, they display behaviors of elevated
[SPEAKER_00]: avoidance, freezing, risk assessment-type
behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an accelerated early learning,
as well as early memory decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all the phenotypes you
actually see when you knock out the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also this thing called
clinical endocannabinoid deficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: which many of you have heard about.
[SPEAKER_00]: A theory promoted by Ethan Russo for many
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It posits that disorders like migraine,
fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome
[SPEAKER_00]: are related manifestations of low
endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things, these frequently occur
together, and they respond well to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're seeing in these rare variant
cases seems to parallel that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it kind of suggests that these
patients would be good candidates for CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: agonist therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given that there is a crystal structure
of cannabinoid receptor, we decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: just take a look and see where the
variants map on that structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out they actually map to what
the seven transmembrane domain,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them near the binding pocket or
around that domain, relatively few in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasmic signaling domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps this domain is more tolerant to
variation in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for diacylglycerol lipase, we see a
similar thing, different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing an excess of seizures
in these 36 cases that had rare variants,
[SPEAKER_00]: excess of developmental disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: One particular rare phenotype simply
labeled as abnormality of brain
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that increased at significant
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then combinations of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all quite significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like we have an association
with increased susceptibility to seizures
[SPEAKER_00]: and developmental disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are enriched in our database by
about seven times compared to NOMAD,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is actually a database of ostensibly
normal people, about 130,000 individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So significant enrichment in a disease
population and a number with zero
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we see some shared phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this particular rare abnormality of
brain morphology is highly enriched in
[SPEAKER_00]: DAGLA variants, including two of five
patients with one particular variant that
[SPEAKER_00]: they share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no crystal structure for DAGLA,
but you can see that these variants kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cluster in the three prime ends of the
protein, or at least of the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular domain has a lot of
phosphorylation sites and is probably more
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerant of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't go into this, but essentially
DAGLA is involved in neuronal
[SPEAKER_00]: developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of studies in knockout
mice that show it alters nerve development
[SPEAKER_00]: in different parts of the brain when it's
knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we think this is interesting and
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely warrants additional
study on other endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we found these rare
variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some cumulative associations from
the CBD response study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're basically working now on
following up with some additional patients
[SPEAKER_00]: from Elizabeth Thiel's group and Jersey
Slavarsky's group, about 144 additional
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, plus Eric Marsh, that we should
be able to push these associations over
[SPEAKER_00]: the top, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to end on a quick note.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always seeking new collaborations
for these kind of genetic studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to understand from the genetic side
what's going on when we treat patients
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been developing some new resources,
panels to look at pain, syndromes,
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine, abdominal fibromyalgia,
a whole bunch of genes that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: basically pulled in so that we can use
this in a study to identify additional
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that might be involved in
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cortigen has a new subsidiary called
Avantra Genetics, which you may be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have panels for migraine, abdominal
pain, auto-inflammatory disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can actually talk to the folks
out at the booth, and they might give you
[SPEAKER_00]: some helpful advice.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
