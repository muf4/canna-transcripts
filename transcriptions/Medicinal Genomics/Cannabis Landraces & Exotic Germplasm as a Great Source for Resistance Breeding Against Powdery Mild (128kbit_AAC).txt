[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for the organizing committee
for inviting me to present our research on
[SPEAKER_01]: paddling and do genetic resistance in this
conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am lead pathologist scientist at Aurora
Cannabis Company located in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our facility is a dedicated breeding and
genetics facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are focused on different breeding
projects from Oroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the projects going on,
plant architecture, potency and disease
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the project that my team and I are
focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever I have this experience that when
I introduce myself as a plant pathologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly with the people who do not
have plant science background,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting this question that really the
plants have immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it doesn't look like that they have
this complex immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the answer is, of course, plants have
been around for at least 500 million
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's evolution of higher plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've been able to defend themselves
against all these microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal, viral and bacterial pathogens are
trying to infect these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have a immune system and they have
an adaptive and inducible immune system as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty sophisticated in its own kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's not as complex as mammalian
immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants do have a multi-layered immune
system and I have a pointer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm the first speaker today that can
use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Alex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this metaphoric onion showing the
multi-layer nature of plant immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the outer layer of plants, plant immune
system, we have preformed defenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Defenses like cuticle or trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondary metabolites of preformed
antimicrobial compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that like THC and CBD,
they have some antimicrobial properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in the heart of the plant immune
system, we have an inducible defense
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism or immune response where the
plant host is able to precisely perceive
[SPEAKER_01]: the presence of the attacking pathogen and
adapt and tailor its defense response
[SPEAKER_01]: according to the nature of the attacking
pathogen or invading or penetrating
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganism into its tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants do have certain receptors that can
sense the presence of a specific pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the perception of the
presence of the pathogen, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: upstream signaling molecules, nitroxide
and hydrogen peroxide are among them,
[SPEAKER_01]: that start a signaling cascade and
transduction pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some hormones play a role in this signal
transduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a speaker previously that spoke
about salicylic acid, jasmonic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are important defense-related
hormones in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: To transfer the danger signal to the
nucleus, where defense genes are located.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the genes that can,
based on the type and nature of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogenic attack, can define how the
plant is going to respond to that
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several different genes that
produce specific antimicrobial compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: on proteins called pathogen-acid-related
proteins or PR proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a programmed cell-depth response,
which is specific to plants, plants is
[SPEAKER_01]: called hypersensitive response.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be seeing the nature of that
response in next slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a type of response that plants
can fortify its cell walls to prevent the
[SPEAKER_01]: attacking pathogen from penetrating into
its tissue accompanied by the accumulation
[SPEAKER_01]: of several antimicrobial compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just told you that plants are pretty
responsive to their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can sense the presence of a
pathogenic attack, but how responsive it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a video here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fluorescence imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you don't see that much right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's top view of an Arabidopsis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great work done by Dr. Toyota from
Saitama University in Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they did, they added a molecule here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They added a compound here that can mimic
pathogenic attack, particularly wound
[SPEAKER_01]: response in plant, on this side of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had this GFP green fluorescence
protein conjugated to a signaling
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called chalmodulin, which is
triggered by calcium ion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story short, when you see the
fluorescence illumination throughout this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, that's actually an indication of
the danger signal being spread through the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just imagine that's the initiation of
the observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this danger signal molecule put on
the plant, and then the video starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot click on that play, so Alex,
if you could please play that video for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see molecule is here and bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole plant is right now alerted about
the presence of that pathogenic attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 298 seconds, but if you stop the
video at around 80 seconds, that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: this part of the plant is showing response
to the attack on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 80 seconds for the whole plant to get
that danger signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants are that responsive to their
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next time you're pruning your cannabis
plant, just remember that it knows that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't wanna go into details here,
but that's...
[SPEAKER_01]: Adaptive or inducible plant immune system,
because if you probably know and you saw
[SPEAKER_01]: the first slide, we just discovered and
identified a new resistant gene in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant, which is effective against
pancreatic disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question here is that what is a
resistant gene?
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistant genes are a specific
classification of... They encode a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific classification and group of
proteins, and these are the proteins that
[SPEAKER_01]: can perceive the presence of pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no relation to the final
outcome or downstream of plant defense
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just at the upstream where the plant
is able to perceive the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are multiple defense responses that
can be activated after that interaction
[SPEAKER_01]: between plant receptors, which are our
proteins or resistant genes, controlled by
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant genes, and a pathogen drive
protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pathogens, when attacking the plant,
this is pathogen triggered immunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They release some molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're broken down molecules coming from
the cell wall of the pathogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, chitin from fungal pathogens,
that can be perceived by broad spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor like kinases, trans membrane
protein, which initiate a broad spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: defense response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evolutionary is speaking in this arms race
or ping-pong like interaction,
[SPEAKER_01]: evolutionary or co-evolutionary
interaction between plant and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pathogens have been able to kind of
suppress that mechanism by injecting
[SPEAKER_01]: certain protein molecules called effectors
into the cytoplasm of plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these molecules can suppress that
broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called pan-triggered immunity in
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistant genes encode proteins that can
perceive this specific proteins injected
[SPEAKER_01]: by pathogen into the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the proteins and genes that
we are after.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can find these genes and some
genetic resources available to us,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we can use those genes to make new
cultivars or genotypes of cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: or any plant and make them naturally
resistant to that pathogen and disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is pan-triggered mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that you have heard the
name pan-triggered mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you I know that you're specialists
on the matter as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pan-triggered mildew is a fungal disease
that is right now one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: economically important diseases of
cannabis, which threatens cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is three important stages of this
disease, fungal disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: First stage, we have the spore of the
pan-triggered pathogen and this pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: is mainly airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spores are in the air landing on the
new leaf and then it's germinated and they
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrate into the tissue of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use high level of pressure in a organ
called approsorium to punch or drill,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, the cuticle and cell wall of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the pan-triggered mildew species
have pressure twice the pressure of your
[SPEAKER_01]: car, a tire car, about eight pascal,
eight bars, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's highly melanized organ that can
produce that amount of pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can easily punch an aluminum foil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the amount of pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I get this comment that if we
have some new genotypes with thicker
[SPEAKER_01]: cuticle, do you think that that might be
resistant to pan-triggered mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is obviously no.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that penetration, the pathogen is
able to make this organ, it's called
[SPEAKER_01]: hostorium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should consider that powdery mildew is
a parasite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs the cannabis plant or any other
crop to be alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not kill your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keep it alive and it drive nutrients to
still the host is alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this organ does that job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a cytoplasmic interaction with
the plant cell and it drives all nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: from that plant cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it suppresses plant immune system,
the plant cell, at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It injects several effector proteins that
I just introduced to you to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second stage is that where the
pathogen develops its mycelial network on
[SPEAKER_01]: the surface of leaf and then makes these
vertical structures for its reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called carnidophores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are actually the last stage of
the pathogen lifestyle where it produces
[SPEAKER_01]: millions and millions of new spores and
these spores are ready to fly in the air
[SPEAKER_01]: and go to a new plant and then just redo
the life cycle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very interesting image.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a photoshopped Halloween
image.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, yeah, electron microscopy done by
my friend and colleague, Marco Tedesco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on overdoses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see, as I told you,
the mycelial network already developed on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and then these are the vertical
structures coming up, making the newest
[SPEAKER_01]: spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually the completion of the
life cycle of this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the economic impact of pansymyldoid
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, it's been shown that even my
level of disease occurrence at LPs,
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed producers, can cause losses up to
30% of the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to control this disease, although it
doesn't kill your plants, it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: biotrophic pathogen, as I told you,
you need to apply several IPM products,
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated pest management products,
which are expensive and it's labor
[SPEAKER_01]: intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have staff to apply those
products, doing regular scouting to
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor your growth zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of activities which are,
again, labor intensive and expensive for
[SPEAKER_01]: any cannabis producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So developing new genotypes of cannabis,
which are resistant to pansymyldoid
[SPEAKER_01]: disease, obviously makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collected a diversity panel,
a diversity population of different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis genotypes from different places,
like about 550 genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And among them, 108 genotypes were land
races and exotic genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are genotypes that are coming from
mountains in Afghanistan, from China.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had genotypes from Syria, Middle East,
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally chose part of those
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to have genotypes that are,
yeah, evolutionary speaking, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in the areas with high level of
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding was that probably these
ones are a good source for genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the problem with available
germplasm of cannabis is that because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the years of, yeah, cannabis production
being illegal, the black market,
[SPEAKER_01]: people who grew cannabis, they didn't care
about genetic resistance to diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their selection was mainly based on
potency or flower formation, all those
[SPEAKER_01]: economic traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they applied a lot of fungicides to
control diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the genetic pool, available genetic
pool in the market unfortunately lack,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, resistant genes or R genes that are
effective against important diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we have to construct new
populations comprising of land race and
[SPEAKER_01]: exotic races to be able to detect if there
is any R gene to detect those R genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what exactly we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see these one key plants
growing in our facility that are mainly
[SPEAKER_01]: land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a statistical analysis of the
population that we were working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called principal component analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way to know the important factors
on your population and which data set and
[SPEAKER_01]: factor that you're using actually forming
the structure of population.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually dimensionality reduction
method in the statistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go into details here,
but something really important,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the first time that we did,
anyone that did this analysis on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant as far as I know, the question was
what if we find a resistant gene in a land
[SPEAKER_01]: race and we use that land race to breed
new genotypes of cannabis, but that
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant gene comes with a lot of
unfavorable, that might happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfavorable agronomic traits, because
these are land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not good sources of genotypes
agronomically for any elite cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you can see we tested several
different traits here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The length of the plant, length of
branches, leaf formation, potency level,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's believed that THC,
CBD have antimicrobial compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: so some of these... And it's another thing
that I need to say here that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: pseudoscience, as you know, that are
available online and about cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: some people call it bro science,
that believe that higher potency means
[SPEAKER_01]: better disease resistance in cannabis,
at least for pounds and million,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or some believe that cannabis indica,
and I know that right now indica sediva
[SPEAKER_01]: story is already resolved and it's not
supported by genetic studies, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: believed that those indica leaves are more
susceptible to pounds and million and
[SPEAKER_01]: those sativa leaves are more resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to know how is the situation
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interestingly enough, so we tested our
population of different factors affecting
[SPEAKER_01]: the structure of our population and you
can see that disease index is not
[SPEAKER_01]: correlated with any of these agronomic
traits that I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the numbers probably,
it's more readable that you can see there
[SPEAKER_01]: are different correlation with different
agronomic traits, but disease index remain
[SPEAKER_01]: totally unrelated to any agronomic trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is good news because that means that
we can breed for these pounds and million
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance while still having high level
potency, while still have a, in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: plant architecture, a favorable
architecture of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If dwarfness is favorable, we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or flower formation or harvest index is
not going to be at least based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: population that we test is not going to be
affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a population that we use for
our breeding purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of studies are called GWAS or
genome wide association studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a known way of detecting new sources
of disease resistant agronomic traits in
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how our population responded to
palliative mildew infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that this histogram showing a
left skewed distribution meaning that
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of genotypes that we tested were
highly infected, I mean susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: palliative mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had few genotypes that showed high
level of resistance and here it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: disease index.
[SPEAKER_01]: So zero means highly resistant,
100% is highly susceptible with no any
[SPEAKER_01]: defense response to the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, or fortunately,
I don't know, I had to redacted these
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypes names because of the IP concerns
that Aurora Company has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so there are few genotypes that we
detected that showed high level of
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: My presentation right now is more on the
pathology side of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the breeding purposes,
one method to transfer these genes,
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is another question that I
get that is it GMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you transfer these resistant
genes to elite cultivars?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is being done through classical
breeding approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: One method is back crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be available after my talk if
you have a question about that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by doing multiple crossing of our
donor genotype with elite cultivar,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are able to transfer that piece of
chromosome that contains our resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: genes to our elite cultivar, making the
proportion of elite cultivar genome of
[SPEAKER_01]: elite cultivar higher and higher until
onto 99% of the elite cultivar and the
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant gene, the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to share here a couple of
interesting defense mechanism against
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of mildew that we observed in our
GWAS study.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see the plant on the left is
totally resistant to the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a land race here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a susceptibility situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is hypersensitive response that I
just introduced to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a type of programmed cell death that
the plant perceives the presence of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kills its own cells in order to make
penetration impossible for the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing that, it also fortifies its
cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see those patches that are,
you see the chlorotic patches here and
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are where programmed cell death and
hypersensitive response is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are where, if you put it under
microscope, you will see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these purple dots, it's a specific
stain that we use that can detect,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just two more slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A specific dye that can detect
lignification and cell wall fortification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see just like an ancient
fortress where you need to keep the walls
[SPEAKER_01]: and keep the enemy outside of the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant is able to keep the pathogen
outside of the gate and castle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another interesting resistant response.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not through hypersensitive response,
totally different defense mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just destroys the mycelial growth of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So apparently some antimicrobial compounds
are being secreted and you can see there
[SPEAKER_01]: is no mycelial growth on this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another, that's the immune
system that we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by immune system in plant pathology,
we mean that you don't see any reaction in
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant whatsoever as if there's no
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: No difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot see anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And under microscope, you see this plant
has both hypersensitive response.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the fortified cell walls,
these specific cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is where the pathogen is trying to
penetrate into the tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also we don't see any canidial
force.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pathogen is totally unable to produce
any spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And okay, I skipped that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the final slide of the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We finally found a very good candidate for
our breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just filed our patent two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a gene, single dominant Mendelian
gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that by any cross that we
make, the progenies will have the
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is highly favorable for breeding
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a long list of characteristics
that you need to have for these resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is to be single dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that in a susceptible
situation, you have these spores being
[SPEAKER_01]: generated, canidial force.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the resistant one, PM2 gene,
because PM1 has been published,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you know, if you follow the story,
by Oregon CBD a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the second gene that being
discovered here, second locus actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is called PM2 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that the plant remains totally
free of the disease of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pathogen is not able to produce
any spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reproduction phase of the pathogen
is fully suppressed by this single gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's time for one question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great talk, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there, have you tried looking at this
marker in other cultivars to see if it
[SPEAKER_00]: still holds true in other wines?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have made crosses with our elite
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's back crossing is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, all of them show the high level
of resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, another question, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great work on the mildew, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask you if the defense
response, does it alter or modifies the
[SPEAKER_03]: number of cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you do a test?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we didn't find any correlation with
the level of cannabinoids and defense
[SPEAKER_01]: response.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is a mutation PM2 knockout or just a
change in amino acid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell?
[SPEAKER_02]: The PM2?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that after finalization of
patenting, that will be used in internally
[SPEAKER_01]: to develop new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it will be added to the elite
cultivars because our facility has a
[SPEAKER_01]: business side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OCO innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to check it, OCCO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the plan for this gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but is the mutation leading to a
knockout of the gene or is it just a
[SPEAKER_02]: change in amino acid, changing the
sequence?
[SPEAKER_01]: The activity of PM2?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what kind of mutation PM2 might have?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm available right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
