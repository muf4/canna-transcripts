[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so why do you think that, you know,
they haven't been studied as a
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic, uh, really to this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they have somewhat, and there are a
lot of papers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to short anyone, right,
or kind of be insulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of papers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they were still limited,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, we're going to take a,
a terpene or terpene extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to give a certain amount to
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we see the pain relief,
but for whatever reason, I don't fully
[SPEAKER_01]: understand why those next steps weren't
taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are the side effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the, what's the pharmacokinetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's the minimal dose that we
need to be effective, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really like formalize and systematize
this investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could really turn it into
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm just spit balling here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any evidence for that,
but like one of the reasons could be
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's generally regarded as safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can't get a drug company
interested in making a product because you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you can't, they can't patent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's where I've been working.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the companies that I've been working
with in this space are all smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That they care about cannabis that care
about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not looking to be Pfizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's why they're the ones that are
willing to tackle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that's why they haven't been
tackled in the past with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: larger, the larger groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could also be the possibility that
funding has been harder to come by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to get funding from this
work from a portion of the national
[SPEAKER_01]: institutes of health, the NIH,
uh, called the national center for
[SPEAKER_01]: complimentary and integrative health.
[SPEAKER_01]: NCCI age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of a sub sub part of the NIH and
they had this program that where they were
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically interested in looking at
terpenes and minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I will say just in general,
the cannabis field cannabinoid field has
[SPEAKER_01]: grown a lot recently, you know,
the last 10, 10 or so years, all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: has grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funding has become more available.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are becoming more interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of these minor components or
understudied components of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, like terpenes and the minor
cannabinoids, those have also been growing
[SPEAKER_01]: very strongly as well with that interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the time is just here.
Okay.
