[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I really want to take time to thank
Brian, Brendan, Kevin, and Doug for
[SPEAKER_00]: hosting and organizing this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it highlights how complicated and
complex this field is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten to hear from a lot of
different perspectives on what's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in this cannabis research world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do come at this with two hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I professionally represent Tilray,
which is a federally licensed medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, and I'm their director of
clinical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also have a personal story that is
relevant to how I got into this position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll start with that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I received my PhD in neuroscience back
in 2005, and then went on to complete my
[SPEAKER_00]: training at UCSF as a postdoc,
as most researchers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when our second son, Ben, was born,
I had to take an extended leave of
[SPEAKER_00]: absence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ben started having seizures when he was
14 weeks old, and we were told that he
[SPEAKER_00]: would most likely grow out of it and not
to worry too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started with the conventional
treatments, and actually none of the
[SPEAKER_00]: therapies that he was put on helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he continued to seize relentlessly as
we tried medication after medication after
[SPEAKER_00]: medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he was a year and a half old,
we were told by our epileptologist that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should try a vagus nerve stimulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a pacemaker that goes in
under the skin right here and has a wire
[SPEAKER_00]: that leads up to the vagus nerve and
attaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they send electrical signals up
to the brain to try to stop seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That surgery didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we continued to try more and more
combinations of therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ended up on higher doses and more drugs
than we had wanted him to be on ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: In his life, he wasn't developing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 2012, I was living near Stanford,
and I had found at Stanford these three
[SPEAKER_00]: basic scientists who were working in the
epilepsy field, and they were offering a
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive fellowship to join them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I applied for the fellowship and
miraculously got accepted and started in
[SPEAKER_00]: May of 2012 at Stanford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal really was just to contribute
to our overall base knowledge of this
[SPEAKER_00]: disease to figure out how we could develop
new therapies for this third of patients
[SPEAKER_00]: with epilepsy that continue to have
seizures despite all of the 40 or so
[SPEAKER_00]: available FDA-approved anti-seizure drugs
on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Gaitanis mentioned this earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Stanford, soon after I started
actually, I went to a conference,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this conference was unusual because it
included a family day that encouraged
[SPEAKER_00]: families without scientific training to
come and learn about the new therapies
[SPEAKER_00]: being developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a conference that was hosted by the
Epilepsy Therapy Project, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: developed by another father of a child
with severe epilepsy named Warren Lamert,
[SPEAKER_00]: a really wonderful organization that has
since merged with the Epilepsy Therapy
[SPEAKER_00]: Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this family day, I met a dad who told
me that he was treating his son with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what do you mean you're
treating your son with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: How old is your son?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, my son's five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was incredulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know much about cannabis
in children, but I know that you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: really expect a delayed child to inhale
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea how people were giving
their children cannabis other than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also knew that there's a lot in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't figure out how he was
determining what to give the child.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he insisted it was helping him a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said he would take cannabis rich in
cannabidiol and make butters and give his
[SPEAKER_00]: son a teaspoon or so a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took this information and went back
to my computer and looked up cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_00]: and epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first studies that popped up were,
of course, Dr. Machulam's studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the clinical trials that he did in
collaboration with the Brazilians in 1978
[SPEAKER_00]: and 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like he showed earlier, at least half
of the patients were really responding
[SPEAKER_00]: well to cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, these are patients that were
treatment resistant, so a difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat population that was responding to
this dose of cannabidiol that was around
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 to 300 milligrams per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also found these animal
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the animal studies, CBD either had
no effect or it was anticonvulsive,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas THC could be pro or
anticonvulsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a little nervous about THC and
decided to proceed with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought anything that was rich in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said, oh, shoot, what do I do
with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give my son this plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was three years old, very
developmentally delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to UC Davis and found a
professor of chemistry who also happened
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a medical marijuana testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Told him our story and he agreed to help
me figure out how to extract the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, all the cannabinoids,
and then remove the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extraction was not hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the column purification that led to
the removal of the THC that was most
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did it and we were able to get,
you know, a little tube full of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol that was very concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I had this little tube and I didn't
know where to start as far as dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did this all while telling my doctor
that I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was fully supportive and he said,
great, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we've heard parents are treating
their kids with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have no idea what to tell you,
what to get, where to get it, or how much
[SPEAKER_00]: to give him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I emailed Dr. Machulam and I said,
I found your papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this son with severe epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very kind and emailed me back right
away and said, oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with the lowest doses we used in our
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, the lowest dose they
used was 200 milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, Ben weighed 10 kilograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember Dr. Davinsky's talk
about the Epidiolex trial, it's 20
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happened to be right in the
appropriate dose of cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave it to Ben and he responded and
he was doing better.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he had, you know, after a few days of
having this cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now making this medication in my garage
with my homemade chemistry set became
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely nerve wracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nerve wracking because there
was no way to set up a consistent way to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never could get a consistent supply
of the same kind of cannabis to start
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never could get even a consistent
supply of the C18 beads that filled each
[SPEAKER_00]: column.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't able to, you know,
reproduce it every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought there must be a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I contacted GW Pharma, hoping that they
would be willing to make a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: version of pure CBD for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't get back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone told me that I was crazy to
have thought they might consider giving
[SPEAKER_00]: this medically fragile child a
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, it seems like it's a
no-brainer now that they would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, it was really a risky thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was risky politically and it was still
a cannabinoid even though it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just assumed they weren't
interested in treating this difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat medically fragile population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I continued to make cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I shared it with another family
who had met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had met his son.
[SPEAKER_00]: The son had a very severe form of epilepsy
and had hundreds of seizures a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this family also had a hard time
finding CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I shared the CBD with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike my son's kind of more tempered
response, this family's response was
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this child went from having hundreds of
seizures a day to a couple seizures a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that family, being very, very
motivated, of course, was able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through to GW Pharma's founder,
Jeffrey Guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeffrey Guy is an interesting man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's very charismatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wants to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wanted to know if it was pure CBD
we were giving our children or some
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of CBD and THC because that
would be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be trickier to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had our samples tested at NIDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, it came back without
any THC in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that launched a series of events that
is really well recounted in Fred
[SPEAKER_00]: Fogelstein's article that was published
last year in Wired Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really worth reading, which I won't go
into now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really the collective effort of
these families, in particular Dr. Davinsky
[SPEAKER_00]: and Jeffrey Guy, to go through all the
hoops to make this happen for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get compassionate use INDs opened in
the US with FDA approval, NDA approval,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we could get cannabidiol through
our doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I could tell you that this was
the end of our story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the end of that boy's story because
his response was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the end of our story because my
son's response was, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: more tempered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reported a seizure frequency reduction
of about 40% to our doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she decided that that wasn't enough of
a response to warrant the continued use of
[SPEAKER_00]: this investigational drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So against my wishes and begging her not
to, she still removed him from the IND.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so two years later, we were right
where we started, which was knowing that
[SPEAKER_00]: we had something that might potentially
help him, but not having access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the next two years, I probably
spent one and a half of those years trying
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of artistic medicinal
preparations, all without the guidance of
[SPEAKER_00]: our doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't feel qualified to treat brain
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an epileptologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it puts a huge burden on the
family when the family has to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: medications and decide what dose to give
and make sure that it doesn't have any bad
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects or interactions with other
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was very uncomfortable doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also, all the preparations that I
got, I could never fully quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like different testing labs would give me
different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was never 100% sure of the dose that
was in these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would give them to Ben in the hopes
that it at least wouldn't hurt him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one time I gave him something
that made his seizures much, much worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the worst feeling as a parent
to know that you gave your child something
[SPEAKER_00]: in an experimental way, hoping it would
help him and then watch him deteriorate
[SPEAKER_00]: over the next two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that happened, I decided I
couldn't keep trying with these artisanal
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were always some combination of CBD
and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my guess is that my child is one of the
children that does not respond well to
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, thanks to another IND with another
doctor, we do have access to Epidiolex
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really want to publicly thank GWSN
and UW Pharma for everything they've done
[SPEAKER_00]: for me and for all the children who have
treatment resistant epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because starting this program was not
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of hurdles to overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was costly and it was risky on their
part to do it back in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's thanks to them today that I have
access.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current doctor that Ben's seeing
actually was willing to rearrange his
[SPEAKER_00]: other drug regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's on a regimen that includes three
drugs, Epidiolex is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's had no generalized tonic-clonic
seizure in over four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for us, it's just not that simple
because he's still having these little
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds long seizures during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly can't say whether it's the
Epidiolex that in the end was the magic
[SPEAKER_00]: potion that was part of this concoction
that helped control his seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe it was just natural
development of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem with these end of
one trials, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You never really know why you're seeing
the result you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal now, I think, with all of
these stories is to try to figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: to generalize these individual responses
to a larger population and understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs affect certain specific diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And epilepsy for one, I mean, they chose
Dravet syndrome to focus on because
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy is not one disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hundreds of different
etiologically distinct mechanisms that
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you want to do good, clean
clinical research in epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really smart to stratify them by
their distinct etiology, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make sense to throw everybody
into the same category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that the current system
fails patients, and this is just
[SPEAKER_00]: illustrated in my story, because in the
state-based, in California where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: state-based medical cannabis regulations,
the major issues I ran into were the lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of a safe and reliable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to treat something as
severe as epilepsy, you have to find that
[SPEAKER_00]: product, but then you have to be able to
go back and find it over and over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can't be this question of whether or
not it will be available to you next month
[SPEAKER_00]: or next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be there all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without these safe and reliable
products, I felt like I didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: adequate medical supervision for Ben,
and I was on my own treating this very
[SPEAKER_00]: severe brain disease and completely
unqualified to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the FDA side, I think you have
accessibility issues, as I illustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's the fear maybe that a
physician will be a gatekeeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably going to be rare,
but it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it did happen, I had no recourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't apply to the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the Director of Epilepsy Center
at UCSF.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to GW Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to everyone I could think of to ask
to remain on Epidiolex, but I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing we could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want another patient to have
to be in that position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think accessibility is a concern when
you go through the FDA process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there, of course, I mean,
we'd be remiss not to mention insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage and cost issues, which I don't
think are necessarily going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, but it's an issue that I want to
bring up because it's something we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think no one can argue that GW Pharma is
not doing the right thing in conducting
[SPEAKER_00]: these trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to conduct these trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they had decided not to move ahead
with these trials, there would have been a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of backlash in them not doing the work
they needed to do for this patient
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's excellent that they're
moving ahead and that they're getting real
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you heard Oren said, there's
actually no way we could treat patients
[SPEAKER_00]: without that data in an informed way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to illustrate, I think right now
we have a sliver of the patients who could
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just take the epilepsy patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three million patients with
epilepsy in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a tiny sliver of these patients
accessing cannabinoids for therapy that
[SPEAKER_00]: could really potentially benefit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal is to make that a much larger
piece of the pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we can do that collectively by
mainstreaming this medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a few requirements to
mainstream the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it requires a lot of really hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we need is clinical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physicians prescribe medications based on
the data you give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally they get data from clinical
trials like the data that Oren presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take that data and they start
prescribing and they get experience
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time it's the data from clinical
trials plus the experience they have
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribing the drug in individual cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say every patient is an N of one
and should be treated like an N of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should maximize treatment for that
N of one patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time doctors assimilate both sets
of information to provide the best
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can't do that without the basic
clinical data that is currently completely
[SPEAKER_00]: lacking in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be data on safe dose and
titration schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic safety profiles in specific patient
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Kevin was mentioning earlier,
patients on Valproate and CBD have a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher risk of liver failure, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Side effects profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Side effects profiles need to be known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adverse events, drug-drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then expected outcomes or efficacy
data would be also really good down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the major hurdle to being able
to collect this clinical data has been a
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of appropriate medical preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the reasons why I think
we have to really think carefully about
[SPEAKER_00]: the preparations that we're giving
patients when we talk about collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So data collection is actually a rigorous
discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a lot of work and thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless you have the right compound,
the right chemical, and the dose,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical composition, and a really
safe product, you can't get the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical data you need that you can
interpret then and use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products have to be chemically
defined, obviously, and they have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable and reproducible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's encouraging that the
current spectrum of regulations are
[SPEAKER_00]: changing at a rapid rate, but I would
argue that most of the regulations popping
[SPEAKER_00]: up in new countries like Germany and
Australia and Croatia, they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: governing access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even all the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: states, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They govern access to medical marijuana,
but they're not governing production
[SPEAKER_00]: practices of medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have both, and you have to
have a set of thoughtful regulations at
[SPEAKER_00]: the federal level that govern production
practices so that you can get the
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations you need for medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember, I'm talking about a spectrum
of cannabis use from adult to wellness,
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic, and medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything I say completely fits into
this medical piece of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't define a medicine unless you
have a defined chemical composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I work for Tilray, like I said earlier,
and the reason I work for Tilray is
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think Tilray arguably is the
only country in the world that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: federal oversight of the production of
medical cannabis that can be shipped
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a few months ago, we also got
Health Canada approval to make extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like a broken record,
but without these extracts with a defined
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical composition that are completely
safe, we can't start our clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we have those, we can start
providing study drugs to researchers
[SPEAKER_00]: globally, and we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish I had data already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe next year we'll have some data,
but we're partnering with the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of Sydney in Australia for a
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
[SPEAKER_00]: study, and we'll be providing them with a
liquid capsule form of a defined chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really hope to see good efficacy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Canada, we're partnering with the
Ontario Brain Institute to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of cannabinoids in adults with
refractory epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are two types of trials that
actually give you the data you need for
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very stringent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have placebo controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Oren did a nice job of
explaining the difference between RCTs,
[SPEAKER_00]: or randomized placebo-controlled trials,
and open-label trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from open-label trials and databases,
if they're done well, you can get really
[SPEAKER_00]: good information on how to treat your
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that we're not gonna wait
for RCTs to finish while patients need
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would argue that the path forward has
to involve both, happening at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time, as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would put in a plea to everyone to
fully collaborate on getting these trials
[SPEAKER_00]: done, because I spoke with Nick Lindstrom
and Sarah's yesterday about clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a clinical trialist from Australia,
very forward-thinking in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the N of 40 trials, the N of 20,
the N of 40, the N of 30, many of those
[SPEAKER_00]: trials are not the same as a few good N of
3,000 trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's how we collaborate
to get the real data that will inform
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanna leave you with a quote by a
good friend of mine, Tom Baruch,
[SPEAKER_00]: who said, when science gets politicized,
rational discourse disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that really has happened
in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not addressing this in a rational,
thoughtful way, but we can, and we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would urge everyone in this room to
start thinking rationally, and accept that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are different ways to get to the
same goal, and that everyone in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: probably has the same goal, but different
approaches towards that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to point out that Ben,
you know, Ben is my son, and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: presented him as my son, but he's also a
brother and a grandson and a nephew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the debate over whether or
not to provide him with something that
[SPEAKER_00]: would save his life, the debate should no
longer be about whether to provide him
[SPEAKER_00]: access, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The debate should now be about how to
provide him access.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the thoughtful policies that we
can enact so that no other family has to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through what we've gone through?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not over, I mean, we were the
lucky ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the really lucky ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 200,000 kids out there who still
don't have access to pure cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
