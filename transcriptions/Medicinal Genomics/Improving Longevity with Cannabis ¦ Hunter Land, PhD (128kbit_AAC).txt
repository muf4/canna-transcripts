[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Can Med Coffee Talk
podcast, where we talk with the leading
[SPEAKER_01]: minds in cannabis science, medicine,
cultivation, and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the Can Med
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dr. Hunter Land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunter is the vice president of research
and development at Biopharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: Research Company, one of the few DEA
Schedule I FDA-compliant cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: research and development companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has 20 years of R&D expertise across 25
different indications, as well as 12 years
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabinoid-focused research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most notably, he was GW Pharma's first
full-time R&D employee in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_01]: where he played a critical role in the
development of Epidiolex and Cetivex and
[SPEAKER_01]: co-authored multiple protocols for the
treatment of refractory epilepsy multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: sclerosis and pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Can Med 23, Hunter's presentation was
titled, Effect of Cannabinoids in Canned
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavons on Neurodegeneration, Lifespan,
and Healthspan, which is the basis of our
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find a link to that presentation
video in the show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topics we discussed include defining
lifespan, healthspan, and longevity,
[SPEAKER_01]: why C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans are good organisms for studying
toxicity, toxicity, and longevity,
[SPEAKER_01]: the entourage effect, more specifically,
whether a combination of compounds has a
[SPEAKER_01]: greater effect on longevity than single
compounds, how cannabis compounds compare
[SPEAKER_01]: to other longevity drugs, like metformin
and resveratrol, whether cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds could be used prophylactically
for conditions like Alzheimer's and
[SPEAKER_01]: dementia, determining the ideal dosing
range for cannabinoids, and finally,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether CBD and CBG could or should be
incorporated into a healthy lifestyle to
[SPEAKER_01]: improve longevity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Hunter, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Truleaf.

[SPEAKER_01]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Hunter Lamb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm excited to talk with you today
about the potential for cannabis compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: to enhance healthspan and lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we discuss the research that
your team's done, I think it's important
[SPEAKER_01]: that we define those terms for the
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, if you could, please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, I would say, important
intricacies, the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: lifespan and longevity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, longevity is a hot topic now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lifespan, as you would expect,
you know, typically refers to the length
[SPEAKER_00]: of life within a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about longevity,
it's really focused on who exceeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of mean lifespan throughout that,
in that specific species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, that's a goal of many
people because, you know, longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier lives is something that most of
us try to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthspan, on the other end, is a measure
of activity and more around quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be able to extend life or some
people may live longer, but actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: very poor quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's the point of living
longer if it's, you know, riddled with
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitalizations and lack of activity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what made you interested in
investigating how cannabis can affect
[SPEAKER_01]: longevity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this actually started out with a
conversation with the FDA because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with the legalization of CBD or
the removal from the Controlled Substance
[SPEAKER_00]: Act, the FDA had a lot of concerns with,
you know, what happens if you take CBD for
[SPEAKER_00]: an extended period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 years, 30 years, is something going
to pop up down the road that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's obviously very
difficult to do the studies of humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even difficult to do them in
rodents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a, you know, extended period of
time, maybe three, five years to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: lifespan, depending on that specific
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, I would say, best preclinical
whole organism models is the C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the canary in the coal
mine model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EPA likes this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good model for toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if there was potentially
contaminated water, if they don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're testing for, it's difficult
to determine, you know, what the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: is and if it's really a danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may use C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they die early, then you probably
want to stay away from that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been used in the International
Space Station by NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what's the, you know,
what happens when you're in that space for
[SPEAKER_00]: an extended period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know what that means for
humans, but we can look at other animal
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really the start of this work
was, hey, is this toxic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at what level would it be toxic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that, you know, affect,
you know, the life of these in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular model?
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, what we found is it
wasn't really that toxic until you went to
[SPEAKER_00]: super physiological amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still it wasn't, you know,
overly toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we started seeing this,
you know, increase in lifespan and health
[SPEAKER_00]: span.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also ran that model with cannabigerol,
a lesser known cannabinoid, and we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: similar, similar effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both appeared non-toxic at
physiologically relevant amounts and
[SPEAKER_00]: extended lifespan and activity levels
during that life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, rather as it would now,
again, this is a model, but as it would
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to humans, it would be akin to,
you know, an 80 year old acting more like
[SPEAKER_00]: a 60 year old in terms of health span
measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only did they live longer,
they were more active through that late
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the benefits of health span and
lifespan, it sounds like it was sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: just a happy coincidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were originally looking at the
toxicity, but then observed this positive
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted, you know, we obviously wanted
to find out how safe the compounds were,
[SPEAKER_00]: but obviously when you find out that
there's a potentially larger, more
[SPEAKER_00]: profound benefit, then that's something
certainly important and relevant for us
[SPEAKER_00]: within the cannabinoid industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so prior to this work, had any
research been done into cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: longevity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, what kind of makes this
research unique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this was the first, you know,
full duration lifespan model.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have since been several other
repeats where you see similar lifespan
[SPEAKER_00]: extension, some diving down into potential
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, we took those data,
you know, following these studies and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, Hey, well, if this could help,
you know, general longevity, what does it
[SPEAKER_00]: then do in a disease model?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then could we apply this to something
like Alzheimer's dementia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does this have broader applications to
different disease states, like traumatic
[SPEAKER_00]: brain injury, epilepsy, those sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I want to talk a little bit
more about C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans or they're also called nematodes,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're, they're nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have an endocannabinoid
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have something very akin,
I would say akin to the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system, but which I would say would
probably be less relevant for a compound
[SPEAKER_00]: like CBD or cannabigerol because the
primary function is not through
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are, there are some data
suggesting that CBD may be a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: allosteric modulator, but in humans,
it doesn't seem to, it doesn't seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the recent data presented in the
last month or so, CBD may actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: like a PKPD interaction with THC and boost
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't seem that CBD, the effect
that CB1 is enough to really bring down
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it does work on the endocannabinoid
system, I would say that's probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: minor contribution to its effects.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and I think you already,
you said this too, but just so I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure I understand it correctly too,
that, you know, the C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans and these nematodes, it's easier
to study lifespan in them because their
[SPEAKER_01]: lifespan is so short, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six, seven days, 20 days, you know,
so you can run a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds in an inexpensive model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to look at many
combinations of cannabinoids, many
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabinoids, or like more
recently we looked at can flavins,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do that kind of in parallel within
the same model and kind of get this
[SPEAKER_00]: determination of which compound is most
likely to win or at least have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully be less toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to talk about that too,
because in your presentation, you talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about sort of this initial research that
you did with CBD and CBG on sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: wild type C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans and saw the benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sort of, as you mentioned,
did that secondary experiment on the towel
[SPEAKER_01]: model to kind of see how it could help
with diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I thought was interesting about
that one is that you weren't just looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at isolates there of like single
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also looked at sort of whole plant
formulations and then with can flavins
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of explain how that one differed
from the first experiment you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, I think for years now,
there's been this interest in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, rational polypharmacy as it
applies to cannabinoids or the entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done quite a bit of work thanks
to my mentor, Ethan Russo, years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly had a lot of interest in this
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, sometimes we see an
entourage effect and sometimes we see what
[SPEAKER_00]: I call like a non-terrage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is most profound in
interocular pressure models where you see
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in interocular pressure with
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had CBD, it basically prevents
that effect, that reduction in interocular
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's just one example of how
you could see synergy or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the opposite of synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this particular model, the Tau
model, we really wanted to dive in and
[SPEAKER_00]: see, you know, are we seeing this additive
or super additive effect with a complex
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical mixture with known components?
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary components in this botanical
mixture were THC, CBG, and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we pegged everything at the CBD
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, you know, based on the previous
model, we used CBD as a positive control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we know it extended lifespan and
wild type, we didn't know how it affected
[SPEAKER_00]: the Tau C elegans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many things are really that effective
at increasing survival rate in these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, highly afflicted nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did, you know, kind of our best
guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could use that to compare to
both can flavins and these botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures, again, all pegged at that same
CBD level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that led us to some pretty interesting
results where we do see, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this profound effect with these botanical
drug substances versus just the CBD alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So score one for the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular model, in this
situation with these cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, yeah, I think that's a,
it clearly shows there is synergy or an
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you change the this ratio or
use different cannabinoids, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to be specific to,
you know, entourage isn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, it's a mystery soup,
but it came from a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, what components are there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I would have put CBN or CBE or
some other cannabinoid in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I have no idea if that would have
helped further, if it would have hindered
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we, you know, we really didn't
see with the can flavins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the second study, you know,
CBDs showed about a 10% survival rate
[SPEAKER_00]: versus four in the wild type at day 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can flavin was better than that at,
at day 14, it was about 14 or day 16 was
[SPEAKER_00]: about 14%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we would hope that it would
have an additive, a further additive
[SPEAKER_00]: effect when you added it to the botanical
drug substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was really no, there was a
negative, but there wasn't much of an
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage, maybe a little bit of
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not even to the point where,
you know, it's typically you would think
[SPEAKER_00]: of additive is one plus one equals two in
terms of, you know, I'm taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: medication for let's say pain and you've
got two different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both work on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: One plus one equals two super additive
would be one plus one equals four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you would hope for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we saw with the botanical
drug substance, but we didn't see that
[SPEAKER_00]: when we added in the can flavin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was somewhat better, but not,
you know, we didn't go from 25% survival
[SPEAKER_00]: to 40% survival, which would have been
great, but there may be limits to how far
[SPEAKER_00]: you can push this, this kind of entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this botanical drug formulation
now, is that a whole plant extract or is
[SPEAKER_01]: that just combining different isolates
into like a formulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So under the botanical drug guidance,
you can essentially blend to a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: specification from extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of, that's probably the
best way to keep things consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we did with Sativex at GW.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a high THC chemo war and a high
CBD chemo war that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: climate controlled and consistent,
but then you blend to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: specification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you always have that particular ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially that's what we did here is
we use different extracts to blend to a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also use the can flavin
extract to blend into this for this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the reason I ask is if it's,
you know, sort of a whole plant extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there the possibility too, that there
is a minor cannabinoid or some other minor
[SPEAKER_01]: compound that's kind of doing some heavy
lifting that we're just not seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could absolutely, absolutely be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know exactly what it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and again, with every plant being so
different, you know, you'd love to find
[SPEAKER_00]: this, you know, highly potent miracle
molecule that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which may or may not exist, but it would
have been interesting to run it with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, three isolates in that same
ratio and see if we get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this difference because of these minor
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: There've been a couple of studies that
suggest that the, the mixtures may
[SPEAKER_00]: increase bioavailability a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be because some of these
other compounds are inhibiting SIP
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be, it could be,
you know, direct receptor interaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it could be, you know, a
pharmacokinetic interaction that may add
[SPEAKER_00]: to the benefit of a botanical drug
substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did these results compare to other
drugs or compounds that have been studied
[SPEAKER_01]: for this application?
[SPEAKER_00]: There really haven't been many in the Tau
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this is fairly the, the early
studies with CBD and CBG are fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not quite as beneficial as metformin
for those of you who don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metformin is a drug commonly prescribed
for metabolic syndromes like type 2
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes, but there's, there's a thought
that it may extend life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a couple different ways it may
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the ways is through this
methionine and folate synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to inhibit those two
compounds, which apparently is important
[SPEAKER_00]: for life extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically, those are two known,
or at least methionine synthesis and
folate synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And folate, one carbon metabolism are two
mechanisms known for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may be a mechanistic overlap with
metformin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, both compounds extended life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resveratrol is another compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a silbinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has some similar components as
cannabinoids in terms of like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpene structure within that compound
also seem to extend life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as applicable in humans because of
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something, you know,
we have to be careful with these models
[SPEAKER_00]: just because it extends life and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans, you know, what happens when you
put it in a system like humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens with metabolism in the gut
and bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all critical considerations to take
into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, it looks as good
as many of the other compounds that we
[SPEAKER_00]: think may extend life, at least in this
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so what is the next step?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you start with C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans, do you kind of move up the chain
of complexity there and kind of test it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we could certainly look at different
compounds, but I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: different combinations and different
models of C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But given that tau appears to be,
you know, a piece of the underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: etiology of many different diseases,
it may be important to look at some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, maybe an Alzheimer's
dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you look at rhodom models or human
models because we saw some effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is one of the underlying
mechanisms for traumatic brain injury or
[SPEAKER_00]: stroke or, you know, a number of other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even cancer seems to have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tau seems to be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, having these tau tangles
seem to affect cellular energetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: longevity on the cellular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So preventing those or acting as a
protective agent could be critical in a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of disease states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I guess that brings up a good
point, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are we saying that these compounds
would be beneficial in preventing these
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases from occurring or treating them
in folks that already have them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth is we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, prevention would be ideal,
although, you know, generally speaking,
[SPEAKER_00]: our health care system is not entirely
focused on prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we could potentially do is
prevent worsening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let's say it does, let's say we do
find out that it is genuinely protective
[SPEAKER_00]: and helpful in something like Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, can we give it early onset?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what about other conditions like
MS or Parkinson's that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have this neurodegenerative kind of
disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we give it early and prevent
progression, which, which, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the be, you know, certainly
beneficial to that population and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: not a cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it could it could help
until something else is potentially better
[SPEAKER_00]: that that is a cure arrives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet another thing that you had mentioned,
too, is that sort of the results you were
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing was equivalent to like an 80 year
old human feeling like a 60 year old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we better get it early before you are
80.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or can an 80 year old, you know,
take it now and feel younger?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even how well that would would
translate, you know, we're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, based on the data,
it would seem that taking for a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time, probably similar to exercising your
whole life or dieting your whole life may
[SPEAKER_00]: be of benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what degree that benefit exists in
humans, I think is is unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it must be so difficult to to
determine that in a human, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's just so many different
factors like variables, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these epidemiological studies around diet
and vitamins and nutrition, just
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many confounding factors that make that
data very difficult to determine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the key point for the early
studies is that it doesn't appear to be
[SPEAKER_00]: overtly toxic at these levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we do know in humans that there are
some potential dangers around liver
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity with high doses of C.
[SPEAKER_00]: B.
[SPEAKER_00]: D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with certain drugs like
valproic acid, which is also known a known
[SPEAKER_00]: liver toxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I wouldn't say that,
you know, high doses for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your whole life are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be some complications there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at low doses and medium doses,
it doesn't appear to be a problem based on
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusively on this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a it's a big leap to say the
same for humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looked toxic, then there would be a
lot more alarm bells.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it is difficult to make that leap,
even though I keep trying to make you keep
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In looking at the results, and you talked
about dosing, it seemed like there was
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a sweet spot range for the dose
that really got the best effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't necessarily the highest dose
that got the best effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering if you could speak a bit
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is we saw it across both
studies and botanical drug extract and and
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate and tau model and not tau model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's not really surprising
because we do expect just about everything
[SPEAKER_00]: at a certain level to have toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and what we see actually CBG appears
to be less toxic in this model than CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram per milligram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but again, you know, you can there's
an LD 50 for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you go up, eventually something's
going to get toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would also say in terms of efficacy,
this is it's been a theory for some time
[SPEAKER_00]: about this kind of inverted you or kind of
biphasic effects with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're more profound with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a, you know, a narrow dose
window for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that, you know, low amounts or
moderate amounts increase appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may help with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may help with sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start giving really high
doses of THC, you get massive paranoia,
[SPEAKER_00]: nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of hospitalizations for
people that, you know, didn't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: much was in their brownie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you know, as with these sorts of
physiological effects, you may see the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing in lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking too much may be a hindrance or may
be neutral in terms of being a benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know kind of where that
sweet spot would be, especially as it
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to CBD and CBG in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you can't necessarily apply the
dosage that was effective in C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is there like a conversion there
that you could take in terms of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: dose would be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there is a conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of complicated how you do it in
C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two ways you could actually look
at the exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could spin them down and look at their
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could use it as a correlate with
with other compounds that have similar
[SPEAKER_00]: lipophilicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that 40 nanograms per mil,
or 40 nanograms, 40 micromolar,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, is it's certainly a
physiologically relevant amount and not
[SPEAKER_00]: the same as, you know, if I was doing work
in a dish, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're basically eating the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the concentration in their food,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not necessarily their exposure on the
cell level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see, you know, cancer studies,
oftentimes we're applying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be the cell exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the food exposure,
which is relevant to their internal
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure after metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and apologize if you already answered
this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do we think is going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what mechanism is being applied to
kind of improve the health span and
[SPEAKER_01]: lifespan of these C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we really know that yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, you know, CBD and CBG
are, I would say, promiscuous molecules in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike a lot of new chemical entities and
synthesized drugs, they're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to work on one receptor type.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not highly selective for one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know that CBD has at least 68
known targets and none of them are really
[SPEAKER_00]: potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is certainly more clear that it works
primarily as a partial agonist at CB1,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also has some other, quote unquote,
off target effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, even less about CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's difficult to determine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be relevant to cellular energetics
or mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there's some potential mechanisms
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nucleotide receptors that may be
important for transcription, translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So truth is, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many that are, are countless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably spend the rest of my life
trying to determine which combination of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a hundred different mechanisms
are contributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something's going on and you know,
how can we apply it to potentially make a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine to help people is what would be
great to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, I think that's the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good job, security.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got plenty of things to
investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably work on this the rest of my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, I'm going to do it again
and I'm sorry, but what is, so I'm an,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an otherwise healthy person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I exercise, I eat right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to take my vitamins and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can I, should I incorporate CBD,
CBG into my routine to potentially help my
[SPEAKER_01]: lifespan and health span?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too early to tell or?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, I think it's still too
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you, you certainly could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things I would watch out for things like
drug, drug interactions and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain people with certain conditions,
it may not be right for that individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also just knowing where to get a
quality thing that is labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it can be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is kind of diverging a little
bit from this conversation, but these are
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly high milligram doses and,
and humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, taking 10 milligrams of CBD
and a gummy may not be doing much of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're willing to spend on,
you know, a hundred milligrams or hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of milligrams per day, it can get
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that could be, you know,
three, $400 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then where do you get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, which company is the most
reputable that has CBD and CBG and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, an idealistic ratio for,
for health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that remains to be a kind of
industry wide problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, is that the dosing level that
we're talking about here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be akin to hundreds of
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we did see effects at lower doses,
but, um, and, but yes, it's probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: just 25 milligrams a day of CBD could be,
but, um, you know, we don't, we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll hold off then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe advisable may, if nothing else,
it'll probably save you some money.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Hunter, before I let you go,
I want to give you a chance to,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, share any other resources,
um, that might be out there that folks
[SPEAKER_01]: could read up on if they're interested in
learning more about this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, then please also plug any,
any ways that people could get in touch
[SPEAKER_01]: with you and learn more about the work
that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, unfortunately there aren't a lot
of resources in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the maybe PubMed or Google scholar,
uh, we're working to make more resources
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, publish these data and
we'll see how it gets out to the general
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, certainly you could attend CanMed next
year and maybe there'll be some more great
[SPEAKER_00]: presentations on these topics and,
um, we'll just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are any questions,
um, I'm on LinkedIn, pretty easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't too many Hunter lands out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, feel free to reach out there and,
and, uh, and we'll keep you posted on,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we should have some more data next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look forward to that data and I will
make sure to put a link to your
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation at CanMed 23 this year and
the show description so people can check
[SPEAKER_01]: that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you, uh, we'll see you down
in CanMed next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
