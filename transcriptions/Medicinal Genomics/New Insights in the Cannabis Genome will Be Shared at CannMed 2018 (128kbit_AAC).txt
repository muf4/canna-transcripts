[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Kevin McKernan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the chief scientific officer of
medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year at CanMed, we have some
exciting stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been funded by a cryptocurrency
named Dash, who is also sponsoring the
[SPEAKER_00]: conference, but they also were very
interested in entering the cannabis market
[SPEAKER_00]: as a solution to many of the banking
problems in the field, whether that be
[SPEAKER_00]: raising money for new companies or whether
it be solving point-of-sale banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they recognized that the seed-to-sale
tracking system is also a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: disjointed and can probably benefit from a
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we proposed to them to sequence a
cannabis genome to the best extent that's
[SPEAKER_00]: ever been done before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they liked that idea because it forms
a nice foundation for seed-to-sale
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking and also a good scientific sort
of donation to the field to get their name
[SPEAKER_00]: well established.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've now done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They funded us two months ago and we've
been through and we've done about 90 full
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage of cannabis genome known as
Jamaican Lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked this strain for a very important
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dates back to 2007 and it won a
cannabis cup in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a type two cannabis plant,
which makes both CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are a little bit controversial
right now based on some recent patents
[SPEAKER_00]: that have issued.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by sequencing this, we hope to make
a reference genome for the whole world to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put it public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to help people design
better tools in the cannabis field because
[SPEAKER_00]: the current references we have,
while they were beneficial for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: few years, the technology today can make
them far, far better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be presenting on some of that
work and all the sequencing we've done
[SPEAKER_00]: with single molecule sequencing and
piecing together this genome into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the assemblies we have are
better than the Human Genome Project was
[SPEAKER_00]: when we assembled it for the White House
back in 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we had a party at the White House
over the Human Genome Project completion,
[SPEAKER_00]: the size of the contigs of the human
genome were about 500,000 letters long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average number of them, that's what
they call the N50 number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So half of the genome rests in pieces that
are larger than 500,000 letters in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have cannabis genomes that are
better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that it deserves some
celebration as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to celebrate those at
CanMed and show you what those genomes
[SPEAKER_00]: look like, what tools we use to build
those genome references, and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: enable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you have better references
like this, we think it actually opens up
[SPEAKER_00]: the door for all types of epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic studies, we can now see that THC
and CBD synthase are actually on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch of sequence and that they may be
interacting in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really interesting find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll probably also help for people
who are trying to think about RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do RNA interference to
maybe thwart off pests and other types of
[SPEAKER_00]: things plaguing the cannabis plant,
you really have to know your targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing's true for any CRISPR Cas9
type of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We suspect the RNA interference stuff will
come first because it's less of a GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a way of applying foliar
sprays to modify the expression of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to do those things, you really have to
have good cannabis references.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like having them public as much as
they can be so that we can keep this an
[SPEAKER_00]: open form of science for the rest of the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be showcasing a lot of
that at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we encourage everyone to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
And we'll see you next time.
