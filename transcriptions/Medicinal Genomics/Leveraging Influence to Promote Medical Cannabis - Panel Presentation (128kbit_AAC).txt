[SPEAKER_04]: Well, welcome to LA, the cannabis capital
of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my name is Michael Srametis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the CEO of Advanced Nutrients,
Big Mike's Blends, and the Locturnus Labs,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a cannabinoid research incubator
being built right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a $20 million lab.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Danny Keith.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the CEO of Cannabis Club TV.
[SPEAKER_09]: I work with Tommy Chong as one of our main
influencers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we really strive to do is tell
the story.
[SPEAKER_09]: And educate the customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Short and sweet, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Eben Britton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a former NFL player.
[SPEAKER_01]: I played six years in the league with the
Jaguars and the Bears as an offensive
[SPEAKER_01]: lineman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into the cannabis space,
into cannabis advocacy, activism,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through my career, I suffered a laundry
list of injuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: How that's dealt with in the NFL is lots
of prescription pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a handful of concussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through that, cannabis was really my
preferred source of pain management.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when the pills, opiates in
particular, made me feel insane,
[SPEAKER_01]: irritable, made it difficult to sleep and
recover, you know, I could constantly come
[SPEAKER_01]: back to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the one thing that helped me
recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helped me heal from, you know,
long day of grind, three hours of full
[SPEAKER_01]: padded practice, smashing into other 300
pound individuals hundreds of times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that does a lot of damage to
your skeletal system, to your brain in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, coming out of that
experience, feeling like I had,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part, my body and my mind
intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, learning about the
neuroprotectant antioxidant qualities of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids in the brain, following brain
trauma and concussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot to push the NFL to remove
cannabis from its banned substance list,
[SPEAKER_01]: as it looks to be the number one remedy to
their biggest issue, which are concussions
[SPEAKER_01]: and CTE, which is affecting just about
every guy that plays football,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's from high school to the NFL.
[SPEAKER_01]: 87% of football players tested positive
for CTE.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from high school to the NFL.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99.9% of NFL brains tested positive for
CTE in a Boston University study that came
[SPEAKER_01]: out probably about a year ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I created an organization called
Athletes for Care, which is a resource and
[SPEAKER_01]: education platform for athletes in their
transition out of their careers as pro
[SPEAKER_01]: athletes, as well as, you know,
educating them on the medicinal benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis as opposed to prescription
pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the panel's about to be about medical
cannabis, but in this scenario,
[SPEAKER_02]: the NFL, I always imagined it would be
better for the players to actually have
[SPEAKER_02]: preventative medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That there should be probably
neuroprotectants in their bloodstream
[SPEAKER_02]: during the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: This term medical seems very reactionary.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, right now the NFL,
unfortunately, continues to run from their
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's funny that you can watch a
football game now and they have PSAs
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about new helmet technology,
which does nothing, as we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about coaches are really
concerned about the wellbeing of their
[SPEAKER_01]: players.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's bullshit, frankly,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is something that, you know,
our federal government has a patent on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids as neuroprotectants and
antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NFL has a major issue with
concussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are guys, you know, CTE,
the wreckage that it causes is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're a 40 year old man and
you're already being diagnosed with stage
[SPEAKER_01]: two dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have friends, guys who have
played in the league who are in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, real dire need of anything to
get them out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, the NFL seems to be very
slow to take on this conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're starting to approach it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other leagues have been more proactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it really comes down to the
owners relationship with the players,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you're a rookie coming into the
league, it's about protect the shield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everything you do as a player is
about maintaining the integrity of the
[SPEAKER_01]: league rather than putting that before
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the NFL owners have a long history of
turning their backs on players.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at Colin Kaepernick right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've totally demonized him and ruined
his career, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And power to him for taking them to court
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I've had conversations with
NBA owners who are very, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to support their players in any
way they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you see with guys like Al
Harrington, Cliff Robinson, these guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: really making strides.
[SPEAKER_01]: David Stern, former commissioner of the
NBA, saying that guys should have access
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Steve Kerr talking about it
with the Warriors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so they're much more proactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually do care about players'
well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this isn't like a boo-hoo thing
for the NFL players.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really on the NFL players
at this point to make a stand for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't go out and play that
Thursday night game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay in the locker room until you start
getting your demands met.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at this point, you know,
the PA is really just a front for the NFL.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's all funded by the league.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you walk in there, even me as a
former player, they don't care about
[SPEAKER_01]: former players.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, from aside from that,
they're not really looking to go up
[SPEAKER_01]: against the league in anything that
matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think at this point,
with everything that's happened,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the conversations that have been going
on, the opiate abuse in the league,
[SPEAKER_01]: NFL players are four times as likely to
abuse opioids than the average American.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, they have a number of
issues that cannabis can solve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be a bargaining chip for
them on the table coming into this new
[SPEAKER_01]: collective bargaining agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but what it's going to be is you
guys play two more games.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll allow you to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least in the states where it's
legal, you can access it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's still a long stretch
for the league at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And are you seeing traction in other
sports like NHL obviously plays across
[SPEAKER_02]: borders with Canada?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is this, can we leverage the other
athletic associations to try and make
[SPEAKER_02]: change?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, the NFL will make
a change at, you know, the very last
[SPEAKER_01]: minute that they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're totally right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NHL is much more interested in the
cannabis conversation, allowing their
[SPEAKER_01]: players to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A guy that is a co-founder with me at
Athletes for Care, Riley Cote,
[SPEAKER_01]: has made some tremendous strides in
getting the NHL Players Association to
[SPEAKER_01]: start having these conversations about
cannabis, at least for their former
[SPEAKER_01]: players.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you'd get it removed from the banned
substance list.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the NFL is in a unique
position because they have so much
[SPEAKER_01]: influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they could really, you know,
I challenge the NFL over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one of these times I say it,
they'll read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, they could really be the
ones spearheading this new era of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they could be spearheading this
idea that these cannabinoids can be used
[SPEAKER_01]: to treat traumatic brain injuries,
as well as, you know, they've got a great
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity for, you know, the best case
study for cannabis as a preventative
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, you know, in their players and
every team in the league.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you've been in this industry longer
than I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what's your perspective on this?
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: What precisely are you asking?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a lab started now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been making nutrients for many
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a long track record.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every one of you who are sitting here in
the audience is an influencer that will
[SPEAKER_04]: positively showcase cannabis in the way
that it must be shown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad Netflix got rid of the show
disjointed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sick of seeing the typical stoner
stuff and them making fun of us and
[SPEAKER_04]: laughing at us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the last 40 to 50 years, the general
public has been indoctrinated falsely,
[SPEAKER_04]: given false information and been
brainwashed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to take a while to unravel
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to take all of us in this room
whether it's the state level, the local
[SPEAKER_04]: level, you got to get busy and start
either writing articles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eben here, he's a creative writer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did something very smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: He learned how to write.
[SPEAKER_04]: Write white papers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inform the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get rid of the stigma and let's enter into
the new age of what cannabis really is
[SPEAKER_04]: about and what it can do for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if it's recreational,
nutraceutical, or pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody deserves to have great delivery
systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Safe and standardized products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone sitting in this room can have
a hand in it if you choose to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm asking you to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back to your cities where you came
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start writing articles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting on TV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone who will listen to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do not allow them to stigmatize
cannabis in a negative way because we
[SPEAKER_04]: don't deserve it and we've worked too hard
and too long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this plant is an amazing plant that
has so many properties to heal people in
[SPEAKER_04]: so many levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if you're a recreational user
or pharmaceutical user.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, you're all patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're medicating for a reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all deserve safe, standardized
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd offer you to add in the discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think the whole recreational
medical thing is a bit of a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some sort of forced dichotomy that
doesn't really exist if you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: enough of the former or of recreation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to find out that you need the
medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, you've had the same
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you, David?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your feel on this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, that's exactly why we got
into the business and started doing the
[SPEAKER_09]: indispensable broadcast network is because
of the stigma.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, being in the NBA, we had players
that were using CBDs and using marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, the teams would prefer it versus
them going out and drinking and getting in
[SPEAKER_09]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to me, I had kind of an entourage
effect with we had just finished the 2015
[SPEAKER_09]: season.
[SPEAKER_09]: Things were going good.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of a sudden, Tommy got rectal cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: My wife got a brain tumor.
[SPEAKER_09]: My dad passed away from opiates.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at that particular moment,
I left the team and I went full bore into
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis Club TV.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with Mike on the sense that
even though Tommy is our influencer,
[SPEAKER_09]: he's an amazing activist.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the campy side of cannabis is not
always well received.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's our biggest weapon used against
us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think for us, we try to really focus
on bringing educational content,
[SPEAKER_09]: whether it be how to grow, how to cook
with cannabis, topics of discussion,
[SPEAKER_09]: new financial information.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about the education.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to Mike's point, we live in an era
where every single one of you guys can be
[SPEAKER_09]: an influencer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can help spread the word.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really about having that
discussion with people, asking them what
[SPEAKER_09]: their point of view on it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of it's just fear.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the benefit of having the
science platform and having that
[SPEAKER_09]: relationship with cannabis and learning
words I've never heard before is how we're
[SPEAKER_09]: going to be able to reach a lot of these
patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we need to make people feel as
comfortable that they go buy a bottle of
[SPEAKER_09]: whiskey, that they're able to feel it's
just as comfortable to buy the cannabis to
[SPEAKER_09]: treat their nausea for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing a massive migration of the
alcohol industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's my belief that that's going to
echo itself with the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see Tylenol go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see ibuprofen go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see aspirin go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have safer alternatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for those out there, Tylenol
AM404, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an endocannabinoid mimetic that is
made when your liver digests Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes a toxic byproduct in the
process that's sometimes been attributed
[SPEAKER_02]: to in utero autism events, all types of
other overdose-related issues you can have
[SPEAKER_02]: with your liver.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have all these cannabinoids now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are going to march in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point, I think pharma is going
to stop lobbying and start buying and
[SPEAKER_02]: investing in these other cannabis
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that next wave is coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're seeing right now going on
in Canada is just the start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much more to come.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's an interesting statistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: New patients, new medical marijuana
patients who are coming in for the first
[SPEAKER_04]: time into dispensary are 56 years of age.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also spend three times more than the
recreational client will as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pain management is going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aging demographics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a little time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think medical is going to be bigger than
rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't recognized it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, on that point, Big Mike,
my wife's family is very straight-laced,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pasadenas.
[SPEAKER_01]: God bless them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love them to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since being on this path of really
cannabis advocacy, just being outspoken
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, educating at just about every
family function party I go to talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, do you know we have an
endocannabinoid system in our bodies?
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, it's been first my wife's
uncle, then her parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're coming to me and they're like,
Ebb, I can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, I got something for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And immediately, they're converted into
believers from people who were really
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by the stigma growing up in the
60s and 70s, having this idea that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the devil's weed, there's no place for it
in a family setting, in a family
[SPEAKER_01]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, wow, this stuff really
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes me from waking up every couple
hours throughout the night, not being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a good night's sleep, to waking up
feeling refreshed and recovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that as it comes to influence,
like Big Mike was talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into, just at your local level,
your influence, you can have a positive
[SPEAKER_01]: influence on this thing just starting at
your family functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a conversation at the dinner table,
and you never know, you might affect,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna change one or two minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the ripple effect of that,
and how many people continue out of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you positively influence about the
power of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the truth is, it's nontoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thousand, 10,000 year old remedy,
probably older.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never killed anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helps you sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We produce these same chemical compounds
in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And continuing to inform people about
these things, I think it really,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a really interesting conversation
with Dr. Bonnie Goldstein just a minute
[SPEAKER_01]: ago about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of crazy how you can affect,
even she was telling me about her parents,
[SPEAKER_01]: how she's got them using cannabis
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_04]: To Evan's point, the general, I've talked
to a lot of doctors, obviously in this
[SPEAKER_04]: conference, they have no idea that we have
an endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have no idea we have CB1,
CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you educate, things that you take
for granted that, well, everybody knows
[SPEAKER_04]: that, let me tell you, the general public
has no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know the difference between
cannabis, intica, sativa, or a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So start with the basics and educate up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great point, because we
went through a very similar thing this
[SPEAKER_02]: year with our father, and we were
educating folks at Dana-Farber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get in there, and it's a typical PSA
test.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do some scans and everything else,
and the treatment is kind of a protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we say, well, hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's sequence this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we discover he has this mutation
that's known as a BRAF K601E variant.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those in the cancer space,
they're really familiar with this variant,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's a neighboring amino acid
called V600E that is heavily studied,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Roche has drugs that target it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nothing for one amino acid over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Foundation Medicine then gives you this
report that says, well, these are all the
[SPEAKER_02]: experimental drugs that might work for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in phase IIB trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you want AKT inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, having read about AKT and
mtoid, I'm like, well, cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_02]: potent AKT inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why aren't we using those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring in all the papers, show them,
and they're like, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We support you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problems with that at all here,
which I was quite surprised by,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we had other experiences where
when he got hospitalized due to other
[SPEAKER_02]: scenarios, he would end up in a hospital
that was like, you can't have it on
[SPEAKER_02]: premise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They almost threatened to send him the
$30,000 bill for having used it on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's different education that
needs to go on in different hospitals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the cancer centers are aware of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see that people are using this with
success for nausea and for pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But many of the other ER doctors that
might handle patients getting rushed in
[SPEAKER_02]: due to an adverse event in cancer are
oblivious to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're held down to certain rules and
regulations that don't allow any of this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're the ones we've got to work on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fully convinced that if my dad was
able to, he was a veteran, so he was
[SPEAKER_09]: unable to take cannabis if he got tested
positive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they did test for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they had no problem giving him 900
half-milligram pills or five-milligram
[SPEAKER_09]: pills of OxyContin and literally killed
him.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm certain if we were able to get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a lot of businesses that are
popping up and going into the old folks'
[SPEAKER_09]: homes, if you will, and talking to the
patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, my 74-year-old mother-in-law,
Japanese, very strict, no way to smoke
[SPEAKER_09]: weed or cannabis, sorry, is now using CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it came from actually her doctor
referring it to her.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, hey, this is going to be the best
for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: We really got to ask our doctors,
too, to kind of look into that.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your doctor's position on cannabis?
[SPEAKER_09]: How are they willing to look into that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm living in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a beneficial bubble, basically.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody embraces cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a pretty small bubble when you
get out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, the United States has to lead the
way to educate the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just reading today, if you're a
citizen of South Korea and you come to a
[SPEAKER_04]: medical marijuana state and you use
medical marijuana that's perfectly legal
[SPEAKER_04]: in that state, it's the same thing as
breaking the law in South Korea and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: liable to get five years in jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Abu Dhabi, if you go there and they
take your blood and they find cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: in your blood, it is exactly the same as
possession.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful where you travel.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the real point.
[SPEAKER_04]: United States and Canada must educate the
rest of the world and society,
[SPEAKER_04]: because we are, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: To your point, we're living in a bubble
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you step outside of this bubble,
it's extremely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I travel all over the world and I get in a
lot of conversations about cannabis and a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of governments are still very
negative.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: This medical journey that we went through
with your father was just eye-opening as
[SPEAKER_02]: to how the amount of ignorance that's out
there on this pathway and the suppression
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, all these people who are
against it, soon as one of their family
[SPEAKER_04]: members gets ill and tries cannabis and is
successful with it, it changes
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen this happen so many times.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right after my wife's surgery,
we managed to mitigate pain and nausea
[SPEAKER_09]: from a full craniotomy, peach-sized tumor
with indicas and CBDs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Her neurologist is like, you're healing
really well.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not refilling your prescription.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: We told her and she's from Stanford.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's like, keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what triggered my mother-in-law and
my father-in-law who was a 25-year master
[SPEAKER_09]: sergeant in the Marines.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just takes somebody having that
personal experience to then transfer out
[SPEAKER_09]: and then they're like the best advocate.
[SPEAKER_09]: They tell everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's telling all her march on fans when
she goes and plays cards, hey,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm using CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: I catch it because I hear CBD,
but the rest is Japanese.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times I've had a few surgeries
and they always prescribe me these
[SPEAKER_04]: opiates.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I'm not going to take them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go, well, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: They watch me do it and every one of them
when I'm done with the surgery and I've
[SPEAKER_04]: healed, they go, tell me more about what I
can do and how can I get some of this to
[SPEAKER_04]: give to my patients, every one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we had one other story I'll share,
which was my father had to get a pacemaker
[SPEAKER_02]: put in throughout this whole cancer
treatment because some of the cancer drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: were triggering his AFib and going into
VTAC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was one complication after another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he ends up going into the pacemaker in
Manchester Hospital and we figure,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right, we don't know what type of
anesthesia they're going to give them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wean them off, wean them down for a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the nausea comes screaming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get the pacemaker in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there isn't a single drug in that
hospital that will get rid of the nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we ask, OK, where's the Marinol?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have Drenaminol on site?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, no, that one is locked
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have easy access to that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're like, well, can we just give
them some CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: After about a good day of this,
they realize he's getting dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless the nurses involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this field because they just said,
go get it and we're going to lock the door
[SPEAKER_02]: and do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 minutes later, he stood up and walked
out of there and they looked like they saw
[SPEAKER_02]: a ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every one of them was interested in CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is something we need to do more
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll also throw it to the vets out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finding a lot of people who have pets
that have cancer or have other types of
[SPEAKER_02]: pain and the vets are on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD, you got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Order it online and we'll give it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not the exact percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: These dogs are facing some grim
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt I give my dog CBD, a little THC,
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got bad hips.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an English bulldog.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got bad hip dysplasia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's going to turn 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, since giving him a little
tincture, I'll put it on his food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's like a puppy again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny how with animals, we're
preventative most of the time,
[SPEAKER_09]: but humans were more reparative.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a little Chihuahua, no teeth,
same age, 10.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she jumps up and down too much,
frail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give her some CBD and it's like,
boom, just takes off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they want it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They know when you're bringing it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it comes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got to get in the same mindset as
animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're much simpler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the way to change hearts is
through their family members.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the population is aging,
we are going to have a demographic shift
[SPEAKER_02]: on the elderly needing access to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finding many of the people of our
age have parents now that are starting to,
[SPEAKER_02]: who were probably vehemently against it
when we were kids, for all the
[SPEAKER_02]: scaremongering reasons we know about,
are now wide awake and open to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's an important point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to keep our intention on that
generation because I think they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have very high medical care expenses
happen there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the system's going to
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to have a big impact there
with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us more about Tommy Chong's
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand he started off as a really
strong recreational advocate and,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, ended up with prostate cancer
himself and curing it with CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had two cancer scares, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: First was the prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: First and foremost, Tommy, he's pretty
much as you see him is how he is.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he is such a believer of the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any time I run across a new CBD cream or
anything, he's willing to be the guy that
[SPEAKER_09]: tries that out and see how it works.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a great test pilot.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when it comes down to treating his
cancer, it was a pretty big scare.
[SPEAKER_09]: The prostate cancer initially was like,
OK, this one's going to be a tough one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he did really good with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we beat that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then within a year, it returned as
rectal cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that one usually takes you out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't really pull off the rectal
cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was diligent about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He watched his diet.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was doing a fair dose.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he tried to stay away from the chemo.
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot of CBD suppositories to really
get there and do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember Tommy going through that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were in Vegas when he made the
announcement.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you could see it in him.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was like, OK, he's just turned 80
years old.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he never gave up.
[SPEAKER_09]: He always believed the plant could heal
him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody was a doubter.
[SPEAKER_09]: His doctors were a doubter.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he ended up pulling it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He has a colostomy bag now.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he's alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's looking really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's still doing a bunch of shows with
Cheech.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we go do dispensary visits,
that's the one thing I really like working
[SPEAKER_09]: with Tommy, is he gets out and talks to
the actual patients and shares their
[SPEAKER_09]: stories with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And people are coming up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used cannabis for my epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a guy that works at our work.
[SPEAKER_09]: He has an extra chromosome.
[SPEAKER_09]: It helps settle down his chromosome if he
takes CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he's always longing to learn.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, to that point, re-educate people
as they're coming through the line to get
[SPEAKER_09]: his autograph or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll have intimate conversations with
them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as an influencer, I think that's
really important.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you have the ability to change
someone's mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, these people are usually already
consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then those people go back to their
family.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, it's that daisy chain reaction.
[SPEAKER_09]: So while Tommy is a campy guy at times,
his mission, I feel like he feels like
[SPEAKER_09]: he's made his mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's paid his dues.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think he's very pleased with the
state of cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think he sees that we have a long
way to go still.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's willing to do the hard work and
get boots on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to Mike's point, I found that when
you give lab tours, you start to win
[SPEAKER_02]: people over.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people are afraid of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they see all this technology,
these mass specs, these sequencers,
[SPEAKER_02]: all tearing apart this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they realize, well, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't just about bongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they see that there's regimented
science behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you own a lab, please give tours to
local politicians and anyone who seems to
[SPEAKER_02]: be concerned about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that is one thing that
really turns people over when they see
[SPEAKER_02]: that there is a tremendous amount of
scientific horsepower being applied to
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in many ways, the testing regulations
for cannabis, you won't get any of the
[SPEAKER_02]: food in the grocery store to get through
this stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is above and beyond what we have for
most of the produce in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one knows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important to show them
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also been doing some work with even
high school students.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been touring around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have some interns here as
well, where we're trying to get that
[SPEAKER_02]: younger generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is tough in high school,
because they feel like, what are you
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to send your students around
through a cannabis testing laboratory?
[SPEAKER_02]: Their parents are going to kill us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it works out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you then get them very intrigued at a
young age to want to march into this field
[SPEAKER_02]: and go into college thinking, all right,
I want to get involved in botany or
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics or something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the influencing side of this is
really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to take our time to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to add, Tommy has always been a big
proponent of testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, even before regulations were put
into place, he was very adamant about
[SPEAKER_09]: making sure that we visited the labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be visiting a lab next week,
another new one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the other thing is that these labs
are still kind of dialing in these
[SPEAKER_09]: devices.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's moving pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: People don't realize the investments that
these labs are having to make to actually
[SPEAKER_09]: stay up to regulation on time with Bureau.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you've got the influx.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just crazy demand and flow of
cannabis, non-tested weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: We tested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it packaged properly?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's been a lot of crazy
regulations that have come down the pipe.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the biggest piece as consumers
that you should always try to make sure
[SPEAKER_09]: you remember is that you really vote with
your dollar.
[SPEAKER_09]: So make sure you're paying attention to
the brands that you're purchasing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're supporting the ones that are
trying to do the best work and not just
[SPEAKER_09]: the ones that have the highest THC or the
ones that you think are going to get the
[SPEAKER_09]: most results out of.
[SPEAKER_09]: Try to focus on who the players are and
what they're doing and the reasons why
[SPEAKER_09]: they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I see the testing space not just
as keeping people honest, but as a
[SPEAKER_02]: discovery engine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw today people are bumping into CBG
plants, which we haven't had much access
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're not doing this testing,
we're not going to be discovering these
[SPEAKER_02]: new things.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the NFL against just THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they care about CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they even know what CBG is?
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is what they have listed on the banned
substance list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some debates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They claim that even taking a CBD isolate
product, you would test positive on an NFL
[SPEAKER_01]: drug test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way the drug testing works in the
NFL is there's an annual street drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: test, which cannabis is on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have a general idea of when
that test is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen sometime between the
first day you get to the facility in April
[SPEAKER_01]: to about the first week in training camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have all of spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically, if you're not tested
sometime in there, then you're definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: getting it that first week in training
camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're free to consume cannabis
as you need it if you're one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank God I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be in the shape I am now if it
wasn't for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it any other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen guys who, coming out of the
league, and they've got bottles of pills
[SPEAKER_01]: trailing behind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get cut and you have a box of
stuff from your locker, those pill bottles
[SPEAKER_01]: are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're really dependent on those to
deal with the nagging injuries you're
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving the team with, whatever surgeries
you've had that you're still having pain
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's no one to help you figure
out, organize your healing regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're going home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys are diving into opiate
addiction, whatever pills they have
[SPEAKER_01]: available to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're losing their minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And meanwhile, there's this thing that's
nontoxic that could really save them and
[SPEAKER_01]: their families a great deal of pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the NFL, really, I've sat across the
desk from the director of player wellness
[SPEAKER_01]: at the NFLPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having a conversation, when are we
going to start looking at cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't you doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, she didn't want to hear any of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was really scared to have that talk
with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this doctor who can't even really
begin to have a conversation about
[SPEAKER_01]: something that actually will help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a bit of a fiasco with the
NFL, frankly, as far as player wellness
[SPEAKER_01]: and player health goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that even them having the
conversation, Roger Goodell making
[SPEAKER_01]: statements about it, there's been a
handful of players in the league now who
[SPEAKER_01]: have come out and had positive comments
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: A defensive end for the Cowboys,
most recently, I think, David Irving.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I know what these pills do to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to put them in my body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this plant that I can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helps me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps me feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the NFL wants to twist it into that
guy's an individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is destructive to the league.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's not NFL caliber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that continuing to push the
science and understanding that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also as well as having a really
positive effect on the NFL's bottom line,
[SPEAKER_01]: having healthier players leave the league,
spending less money on pills, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they could get a benefit from
it in a myriad ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's include the audience a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to jump up to the microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any other compelling stories
or cases that have helped turn people?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are methods that can help become very
potent influencers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to share that I've been doing
education for about a decade now down in
[SPEAKER_00]: San Diego County, which is one of the
toughest counties in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average age of the people I work
with is 67.
[SPEAKER_00]: This revelation in the media that,
oh, the new user of cannabis is the
[SPEAKER_00]: boomer, I don't buy it because I've been
helping these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference is they're afraid to
admit that they use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband's 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just came out of the cannabis closet
three years ago, where he'll willingly
[SPEAKER_00]: say, this is what I do to help with my
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that he's alive today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evan, not to the degree that you are,
but for various health reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen thousands of people over the
last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be part of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to invite you all to come and see
our center in Oceanside, California,
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the name of your center?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give you a card.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Amanda Crawford.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with My Jane.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a couple of things plus a question
would be, one, the main question that I've
[SPEAKER_05]: seen really cut through to people is,
are you in pain?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know someone in pain?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is your mom in pain?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: And just being able to start the
conversation from that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, what we're doing with My Jane is
meeting women where they're at,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is they want to stay in the cannabis
closet, and they want to be educated while
[SPEAKER_05]: they're still in the closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're approaching education from
that, where we bring it into people's
[SPEAKER_05]: homes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys see on the horizon for
education platforms of the future?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know with the media channel that you
have, do you have any insights into what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Greenflower Media is a great
resource, but what else are you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing out there?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think the way that new customers or
patients can get educated is somewhat
[SPEAKER_09]: fractured.
[SPEAKER_09]: And people that are in the closet,
if you will, are probably not going to
[SPEAKER_09]: pick up a high times, are probably not
going to do much research online,
[SPEAKER_09]: or follow anybody on social media,
or go to a cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's one of those things where,
again, we have to create this
[SPEAKER_09]: normalization in society, and you have to
be willing to share.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if somebody isn't out of the cannabis
closet, my recommendation is share with
[SPEAKER_09]: them articles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Share with them a social media channel
that they want to follow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they don't want to follow the
gnarliest cannabis heads out there,
[SPEAKER_09]: but there are tons and tons of social
media channels, and videos, and articles
[SPEAKER_09]: that can be shared.
[SPEAKER_09]: I try to keep a few going out to people
that I think it can help.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you don't want to be that pushy
person, because I think when you're in
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis, everybody automatically says,
I don't want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not looking to smoke yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just asking some questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're like, I'm not going to try to
smoke with you right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're asking me questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to answer them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think compile some education that you
feel is really helpful.
[SPEAKER_09]: The in-home thing is a beautiful idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think I'd love to talk more with
that about you, so we can see how we can
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe help with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll catch you after this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been taking acid cannabinoids for
about seven years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think about sometimes different
types of sports.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I were to compete against people who
wasn't taking it, aside from the fact
[SPEAKER_07]: would I be doping?
[SPEAKER_07]: But I thought, well, maybe there should be
a team called the THCAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're talking raw cannabinoid acids,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not acid and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the HCA, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not discriminating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Proper distinction.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Maha.
[SPEAKER_08]: I run and founded a cannabis student group
here at UCLA called Cannaclub.
[SPEAKER_08]: Eben has spoken to us before, which is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think reaching out to college students
is a huge, huge thing right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, I guess, moving forward with the
youth, even, with just their interest,
[SPEAKER_08]: but also with how curious they are on an
academic level.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really, really want not just y'all,
but everyone in the room, to kind of reach
[SPEAKER_08]: out to students and teach them,
we want to learn about all this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we want to be part of all this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are age demographics to focus
on, like the older consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: But students also want to be a part of
that and help older people kind of get
[SPEAKER_08]: situated with cannabis as well as us
learning simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to thank you, Eben,
for coming and speaking to us students.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really hope some of you cannabis
industry leaders and professionals take
[SPEAKER_08]: the chance and educate even the youth and
let them know what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just a drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could help their parents.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could help them streamline their career
into helping others.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I really want to see more effort
with kids, college kids and the college
[SPEAKER_08]: market, and see what we could do as a
youth in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys should definitely, if you get a
chance, go speak at the Cannot Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are doing great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think there's something really
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be Cannabis 101 at
universities across America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to take a class and
learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just started our own Cannabis 101
curriculum.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was organized and designed by students,
for students, because the administration
[SPEAKER_08]: isn't going to instill a new academic
cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we started it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Jeff Chen taught our first class.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It took a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we had the support of other industry
leaders.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had your support, Eben,
to even speak to us and speak to other
[SPEAKER_08]: student athletes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, we've started a curriculum.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have it every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cat Packer will be talking on November
14th, speaking about the current LA
[SPEAKER_08]: atmosphere and stuff on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, we've already started a
curriculum.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really hope it gets to the
administration.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing our best as students.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also need the support of,
I guess, the industry leaders and the
[SPEAKER_08]: people who've been in the game.
[SPEAKER_08]: For longer than we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Eben, good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Michael Masterman-Smith.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm a cancer biologist here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll be presenting tomorrow on aspects
of Cannabis for Cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I thank what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's sort of my scientific but political
contribution.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's a lot of, you get,
when you reach people on a real level of
[SPEAKER_10]: just like, you know, like Eben says,
it's like, you know, we've got some banged
[SPEAKER_10]: up players that need to be taken care of.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my question is to really, I'm trying
to understand this concept of how do we,
[SPEAKER_10]: in a political environment where we're
supposed to be, you know, we have to be
[SPEAKER_10]: advocates for what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, where do we decide,
forget trying to convince the people that
[SPEAKER_10]: aren't going to be convinced.
[SPEAKER_10]: And how do we build our relationships?
[SPEAKER_10]: And each person has an individual.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, you work with Dana Farber.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe talk about what was that like to
deal with the doctors and talk to the
[SPEAKER_10]: doctors and what was, what were they
responsive to?
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe Eben, answer this question is
that who was responsive?
[SPEAKER_10]: Who were the folks that will be a part of
this, a part of this movement that we can
[SPEAKER_10]: talk to?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we know we're going to be,
you know, it's almost like, should we be
[SPEAKER_10]: in denial of the guys that don't want us
to and are just have some opposition to it
[SPEAKER_10]: and just focused on who's receptive or
maybe what percentage do we put up the
[SPEAKER_10]: fight to the ones who don't want to listen
and versus the percentage of folks where,
[SPEAKER_10]: hey, listen, we're going to get all these
other folks on board and let's focus on
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, give me that, give me that
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you that perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who don't want to learn,
just don't waste your time on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because go after the people who want to
learn, who want to be educated,
[SPEAKER_04]: because those are the ones that you're
going to turn into advocates and the
[SPEAKER_04]: zealots and the future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who are staunch, like staunch
against it, you're going to waste a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: time with those folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the large part of the herd and let
them convince the other guys later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I mark it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll weigh in on the Dana-Farber
experience is that we found it was best to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to speak in their language.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we walked in there with the DNA
sequence of the tumor, which Dana-Farber
[SPEAKER_02]: loves to sequence tumors, you know,
and we're like, look, we have this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've worked with Stan Nelson.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does great work in this field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sequenced one of the first glioblastoma
genomes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you walk in with that saying,
this is pointing to AKT inhibitors and
[SPEAKER_02]: here's 10 papers on cannabinoids being
potent ones and everything else you're
[SPEAKER_02]: offering is phase 2B.
[SPEAKER_02]: These aren't, these aren't, you know,
they're non-toxic and he was just
[SPEAKER_02]: bestowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it helped going in there
with speaking their language.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we didn't have those,
that sequencing data and we didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: those papers, he just would have been
like, you know, if you want to do it for
[SPEAKER_02]: pain, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's off our books.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to know about it,
but we're not going to get in your way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That conversation changed to being,
okay, let's do this sequencing in his
[SPEAKER_02]: bloodstream every quarter if we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way we can monitor the mutation that
we found in this bloodstream because the
[SPEAKER_02]: PSA number is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't trust that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you went through immunotherapy,
it dis-rected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that really is what I think brought
them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm glad that you're here because
you're doing this type of work as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's more, we'll convince
more oncologists if we are on that table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm going to tell you, I wouldn't be
here if it wasn't for the audience that
[SPEAKER_10]: would be interested.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, these are things that is in the
cancer community.
[SPEAKER_10]: We, we, we were always a part of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We always knew it, but unless we had a,
unless we had a movement behind us,
[SPEAKER_10]: we were not really going to be able to
come up here and be vocal about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm at that leading edge and I'm going
to keep on going.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, you can, you can tell all
your friends that yes, cannabinoids can be
[SPEAKER_10]: used to treat cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and so maybe that's, some of the
things that I, that, that folks like me
[SPEAKER_10]: entered to the conversation, but support
the physicians, support the folks that are
[SPEAKER_10]: trying to do the medical aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's going to be a great
potential, but media guy, what are you
[SPEAKER_10]: going to do when you're in, in your talks
to, and in your, in your podcasts?
[SPEAKER_10]: We, we, we partied last night.
[SPEAKER_10]: I forget your name.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a good time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, uh, conference center,
they were like, you guys are the coolest
[SPEAKER_11]: smart guys in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you know, for us, it really is,
uh, our desire to become the platform
[SPEAKER_09]: where people feel comfortable learning
about cannabis, uh, whether it's through a
[SPEAKER_09]: podcast, whether it's through watching one
of our broadcasts, whether it's through
[SPEAKER_09]: listening to us on, you know, uh,
or following us on social media.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I think, you know, I agree with my big
mic about not necessarily they pursuing
[SPEAKER_09]: people that don't have a, have an
inclination to, to embrace cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think at the same time, it is a
round that like you do it around everybody
[SPEAKER_09]: and eventually that one last person gets
split.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and I think that's going to take some
time, you know, so for us, it's really
[SPEAKER_09]: about, you know, trying to not hype things
up, you know, like, uh, this, everything
[SPEAKER_09]: is different for every customer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just really helping people understand
what the, what edibles will do to you and
[SPEAKER_09]: what micro dosing means.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, kind of some of the basics
around consumption, um, is really where we
[SPEAKER_09]: try to focus.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause that's where we have them right at
the point of sale.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're, that's, they're watching a TV
right before they're about to walk in or
[SPEAKER_09]: it's in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we try to have the brands give,
have a good call to action and really try
[SPEAKER_09]: to provide an answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, at least create questions
for them to ask the bud tender when
[SPEAKER_09]: they're, you know, about to make a
purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, we've got one, we'll go one more
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think some folks might are curious
where food is going to be and have some
[SPEAKER_02]: announcements there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so we have a YouTube show,
a little YouTube show that we do on Sunday
[SPEAKER_06]: afternoons from our, our little apartment
house in Mount Washington, where we talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about the cannabis news across the country
every week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how we contribute to
normalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's called DC four 20 LA on YouTube,
Sunday's live four 20.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and we wrote a movie about Alzheimer's
and cannabis to again, help normalize it
[SPEAKER_06]: and share that information to a wider
audience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been, your mama loves you.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the best yoga teacher in all of Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom has, I have so many people come up
to me just randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: She, Hey, she helped me get to the NFL
doing yoga 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
