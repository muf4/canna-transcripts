[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to kind of get straight
into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to talk to you guys about tissue
culture and what it is, how you go about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and just kind of explain how I got
into this whole industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin, tissue culture started about
a little over 100 years ago, and it has
[SPEAKER_00]: revolutionized industries, the bamboo
industry, the banana industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pineapple industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, you could only take a
cutting and get it to root and propagate
[SPEAKER_00]: via that method.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this in vitro culture or growing in
non-biological conditions, or not normal
[SPEAKER_00]: biological conditions, you can actually
create an environment where the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to replicate without the need to
take all that time of creating a new
[SPEAKER_00]: meristem from each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the uses of tissue culture in
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question everybody asks me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apart from the things on this list,
I just want to kind of touch on what it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually get about 20% faster
growth or reset the genetics to almost
[SPEAKER_00]: seed rates by putting plant through tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not every cultivar, and a lot of it
is protocol dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't talk for every industry or
every cultivar of cannabis, but specific
[SPEAKER_00]: ones I have seen the growth rates
exponentially increase by just basically
[SPEAKER_00]: resetting those cuts that are cuts and
cuts that have been going on for about 19,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years, which is huge for this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do we use tissue culture over
cuttings or traditional cloning methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: those sort of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the biggest one is tissue culture
doesn't require maintenance once it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let it sit there, and it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you don't have to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to look at it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had these cultures stay alive for up
to nine months at a time without having to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch them whatsoever under just normal
room temperature conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them will die off by that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, it's good to know
that you can keep them in tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what the USDA actually uses to hold
on to endangered species or other
[SPEAKER_00]: plantlets that they're having a hard time
propagating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually started doing quite a bit of
this at the Denver Botanic Gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I ran their protocol creation lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized while I was doing that,
my passion lie with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody in the industry really knew
what it was or was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I started my company,
Minibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just been going around doing
tissue culture consulting and small-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: lab setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't stress enough, small-scale lab
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions I commonly get asked
doing consulting is, what's this media
[SPEAKER_00]: made out of?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, it's just all the nutrients,
vitamins, and hormones the plant needs in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can incorporate antibiotics
to prevent pathogens from either
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing or coming out into the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can add dyes to try and color-code
some of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about growing with an input of
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of letting the plant
photosynthesize, the plant grows off the
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar that's located in the media,
along with all the nutrients, vitamins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hormones it would normally need to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you know what chemical compounds
and concentrations of all these things to
[SPEAKER_00]: add?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, apart from lots of different
nutrient companies that have developed
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff, there is a media called MS
Media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the standard for every tissue
culture protocol, pretty much,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple modifications for bananas
or orchids or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, this MS Media was
developed for tobacco culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is key to talk about here because
cannabis is not tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you put it in this media,
sometimes these plants are lacking
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen or you're lacking other hormones
that you'd expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires each individual cultivar
to have a specific protocol made for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress that enough because in
every other aspect of the horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, you'll see Scutilaria
bicollensis and Scutilaria orientalis,
[SPEAKER_00]: or different species such as, that require
different hormone and nutrient blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people, when we talk about
cannabis tissue culture, they want to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: one shoe fits all to it and hope that it
works out with just one protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen that too many times where
that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll develop a protocol that works with
one species, not another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to understand the morphology
of your plant, I guess, is where the main
[SPEAKER_00]: concept of all this comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people define it as Sativa
indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized quite a while ago those
terms were invented in the 1700s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The late 1700s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've grown plants that have a more
indica leaning leaf structure and a more
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa leaning leaf structure that have
the same basic effect and require
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say effect, I'm talking about
the hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I did was I tried a
couple different hormone blends that were
[SPEAKER_00]: unconventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see in some of these
pictures here, they'll produce elongated
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves or just weird genetic issues that
are all on environmental base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's epigenetic stress changes rather
than actual gene changes themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you culture that plant again and
again, it will revert back to the state
[SPEAKER_00]: that it normally was at.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are four common stages to tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to summarize these
because they're in all the literature
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your stage one initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about two to four weeks or two
weeks for almost every one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your stage two, which is your
multiplication, you're trying to mass
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stage three, you get the plant to root
once the stems have grown and your cells
[SPEAKER_00]: have massed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then stage four, your acclimation
stage where you go and you harden it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That rooting stage I need to talk about
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get into this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to establish a set rooting
protocol for every single cultivar of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read some literature talking about
hops and people trying to do indirect cell
[SPEAKER_00]: organogenesis where it only works some of
the time on some cultivar of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you run into a lot of problems
going down that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found that if you germinate seeds
or quote unquote a well designed protocol,
[SPEAKER_00]: so straight MS media, takes about eight
days to root and shoot at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can exponentially cut down on your
propagation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do it for cuttings,
you have to develop that individual
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol for that individual species of
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something most people just
don't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now I want to get into the
details and get into stage one,
[SPEAKER_00]: that initiation stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is where the magic basically
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why everybody wants to advertise tissue
culture to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about just cleaning the
exterior tissue of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about endophyte removing
or anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I'm talking about is taking something
like tween 20 which is a non-ionic
[SPEAKER_00]: detergent and adding it with some bleach
to some reverse osmosis water so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no minerals in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixing it up for about 10 minutes and then
transferring everything under your laminar
[SPEAKER_00]: flow hood in order to maintain a sterile
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key there is maintaining clean
tissue from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to talk about two different
forms of stage one tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a third that's called
callus culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to go into that because
as far as I'm aware, very few if anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: has developed a protocol where you can get
shoots or indirect organogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shoots deform from callus culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go on to meristem culture,
which is taking a meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, let's see here, highlighted
in that red bubble here, you can see a
[SPEAKER_00]: meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lateral meristems and apical
meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take an apical meristem,
that tissue can be so new you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: culture out of viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can culture out of viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not guarantee the virus is going
to be eliminated because there's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: chance you had human error and you did not
culture out of that virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, you need to really
look at does your plant have a virus in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, I would recommend auxiliary
node culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hell of a lot easier to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with auxiliary node culture,
all you do is you take a cutting where
[SPEAKER_00]: those red lines are and you can just stick
it straight in your media after cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: the exterior of your tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, this works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that second picture in there,
you can actually see shoots starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: form out of the plant and that's actually
two plants out of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That took about a week to get to that
stage, another week of growth and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been good enough to cut off of,
making it so you can exponentially
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply your cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in time, you can see the
infected pathogen or the plant that was
[SPEAKER_00]: infected by a pathogen in there and those
pathogens can create huge issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard quite a few presenters here
talk about endophytes and that's exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what the majority of them are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have endophytes or bacteria living
inside your cell wall that pop out into
[SPEAKER_00]: your media about two weeks after you've
cultured.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know they're there and I've
heard too many growers tell me,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, my plants are completely clean and I
know exactly what's in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to culture their crop and it's
just, you'd be amazed what you see out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have some pictures coming up of
some of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stage two is the multiplication
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was typically getting a one to three to
one to eight division ratio per culture
[SPEAKER_00]: every single time I did this and that
culture media only cost a couple cents a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's virtually free to do once you set
up the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you only want to keep a plant in
stage two or I guess in culture for no
[SPEAKER_00]: more than five generations at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do more than that, you start to get
genetic degradation the same way that
[SPEAKER_00]: holding on to a 20 year old cutting would
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stage two, the multiplication stage,
has quite a few advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over just typical cuttings as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can create bushy clumpy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That picture in the center I actually
managed to get 22 cuttings off of that
[SPEAKER_00]: single 25 millimeter culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was huge because all of a sudden I
could exponentially manipulate that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and get a ton of cuttings out of the
single plant mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also poses another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else does it do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It cuts down on your actual vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you already have the structure
you're looking for where you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that initial peach tree pruning where
you get that nice bushy top canopy that's
[SPEAKER_00]: all evenly consistent and you start off
with the plant that already has that
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, you can grow your plants a
little bit shorter but they're still going
[SPEAKER_00]: to yield the same amount as if you top
them and top them and top them to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: get that yield that you were looking for
by growing them out an extra month.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third stage here is the rooting stage
and this is one of the big stages that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to touch on here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well but it just depends on your
hormone blend on the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations of your culture and some of
the contamination that might happen with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll have weird contaminants
or endophytes that don't want to come out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the media and once you start rooting
you'll actually see some of the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: degrade because they have endophytes that
only like living in the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it makes sense plants are like
icebergs they have more mass on the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: a good majority of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the keys I want to stress here
is stage three has the potential to ship
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a small-scale trial on this where I
did no more than 24 plants and I rooted
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first picture is how I got the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had cut a plant down this is cannabis
and I had stuck it in a 55 gallon trash
[SPEAKER_00]: bag and forgotten about it for a little
over a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: A week later I just wanted to check see if
it had started molding or whatnot open it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and there were roots all over the lower
part of the plant right where the callus
[SPEAKER_00]: or the undifferentiated cells really would
have appeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start to see those white little
dots those are all root starts and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave it a shot in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not try it in vitro if it works ex
vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results I got were varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant rooted yes but if you look at
that picture the top of the plant didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: always look completely healthy and that
could be due to a lot of different things
[SPEAKER_00]: chances are it wasn't developing some sort
of hormone and you need to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol for that particular cultivar that
would fix that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case I was just seeing binary A or B
do they root or not and turns out they do
[SPEAKER_00]: which was huge for a lot of the future
potential in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I also want to advertise the roots are
not going all straight down some go
[SPEAKER_00]: completely straight out and I don't know
what causes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't look enough into it just thrown
that out as food for thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily perfect root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stage four the acclimation stage this is
one that a lot of people are struggling
[SPEAKER_00]: with so I'll touch base on it really quick
and get back into it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stage four you're just getting plants into
the greenhouse that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once they're there they develop a nice
healthy root system and as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't add more inoculants and create
issues within the plant itself they tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to remain fairly healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at times if you look at the bottom
right picture here you'll actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the plant tissue is deformed or
the morphology of it was not correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means my initial hormone blend when I
was culturing that plant was not what it
[SPEAKER_00]: should have actually been.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see different serration issues and
things like that and within about two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks of pulling it out of the tube it'll
revert back to its normal state you won't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know it was there but it is good to
mention that those type of things can
[SPEAKER_00]: happen coming out of in vitro culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardening stage is fairly simple but
I've seen a lot of people struggle with it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just a matter of removing the
humidity over the course of a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see here is just a soup food
container nothing insane where I just
[SPEAKER_00]: shoved a grodin rockwool cube with a plant
inside of it and slowly over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: about a week I let it harden off and it
worked great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I should mention as I was pulling some
of these plants out of culture the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: would snap off if I accidentally touched
them or I brushed them against something
[SPEAKER_00]: so they are extremely fragile at this
state they've been growing in basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: jello substance the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point you know you can pull it out
you can wiggle it around they might not
[SPEAKER_00]: break off but you go flicking those or
tapping them there's a good chance the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are not accustomed to that they
haven't developed the resistance in the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure to really be able to move around
that much they were never agitated in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning there was no wind in the tube
don't expect there to be wind the second
[SPEAKER_00]: you take them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the four main problems with tissue
culture and this is the biggest stress I
[SPEAKER_00]: have here is improper hormone creations
endophytes the rooting stage and the
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation stage so the endophyte there
I'm sorry the improper hormones every time
[SPEAKER_00]: I have looked and read a research article
online about cannabis tissue culture I see
[SPEAKER_00]: PDZ as the main ingredient so we got to
talk about PDZ here it's actually an
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide that is a plant growth regulator
and it causes the leaves to lose weight
[SPEAKER_00]: but not fall off so as you can see in some
of these pictures this was the some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first tissue culture I had done just
trialing some of these protocols the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves are on there they're a lot smaller
they're yellowing and they don't look
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy I do not recommend using PDZ as a
starting point or any other point for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tissue culture that's just a huge
no-no in my book and I've never found one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant species that works with that
cannabis wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using better oxen cytokinin
combinations is a much better idea
[SPEAKER_00]: metatoplin is the one I would recommend
people start with if you use metatoplin
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a pretty good growth but it
doesn't always root or it can have other
[SPEAKER_00]: issues it's just a good starting point I
also included a lot of other cytokinins in
[SPEAKER_00]: this slide so if anybody wants to
experiment try some of those out your
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of success will go up you also need
to know that oxens in coordination or in
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio with those cytokinins make a huge
difference endophytes are the second point
[SPEAKER_00]: here endophytes I drew a nice little
pretty picture live inside the cell walls
[SPEAKER_00]: as indicated by the blue lines and you'll
actually see them pop out in the media
[SPEAKER_00]: about two weeks after you culture the
plant this is so problematic I can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: explain how many times I've heard people
fail at tissue culture and stop their lab
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've literally don't know what
happened so here's the problem endophytes
[SPEAKER_00]: can be toxic or novel so beneficial those
inoculants that we've all talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: adding to our plants that are very
beneficial might not culture all so well
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just a consideration it doesn't
mean don't use them or anything like that
[SPEAKER_00]: just be aware of what you're actually
adding to your plant and if it's likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: pop out in media if you're trying to get
somebody to tissue culture your plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: your tissue culturing yourself so here's a
couple more pathogen pictures because I
[SPEAKER_00]: just couldn't believe I had over 20 and I
tried to fit as many as I could in just a
[SPEAKER_00]: single slide to show you they're all over
the spectrum and rather than going through
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to identify all these I decided
it would be a wiser use of my time to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to get rid of them so what
I did was I noticed we were using
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculants that had endophytic properties
such as the bacillus what I ended up doing
[SPEAKER_00]: was to get rid of them I watered with
hydrogen peroxide at about a three to five
[SPEAKER_00]: percent concentration every day while
adding in my nutrients to my water over
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of about three weeks I actually
was able to recover some of these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to the point where the pathogen slowed
down or the endophyte slowed down inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant tissue itself and you were able
to get a couple clean in vitro cultures
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was huge maybe not all of them
but some of them would take so if you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at common stage three rooting problems one
of the biggest ones I ran into at first
[SPEAKER_00]: was I was using t5 lights those small
little bulbs essentially and my
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature fluctuations would change more
than 10 degrees sometimes up to 20 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: between day and nighttime temperatures I
realized very quickly that was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest limiting factors and switched to
complete LED lights for my tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: it almost overnight fixed my problem all
of them which I couldn't believe just the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature fluctuation alone potentially
some of the light created some of that and
[SPEAKER_00]: so what I tried to tell people when
they're trying to create some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone blends or whatnot is look at the
compounds or the bottles that you've used
[SPEAKER_00]: as rooting hormones for the rest of your
cannabis grow I mean people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this for years why not pay attention
to the IBA concentrations on the back of
[SPEAKER_00]: clone X or Hortus or Hormex if you start
looking at those and you actually utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: those ratios and some of the additives
they're putting in you're going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more successful at rooting your
culture in vitro I do also need to mention
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous media plays a big impact or
has a big role in your actual next
[SPEAKER_00]: successive stage if you have too much
cytokine and build up from stage two or
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplication media your stage three
media will have residual and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to form more callus than you will roots
ask me why don't really know but that was
[SPEAKER_00]: just a something that I saw along with
nonpolar oxens so I've seen a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that decided I'm going to try and
make callus culture and do indirect
[SPEAKER_00]: organogenesis for my first generation they
make their plant they put it through
[SPEAKER_00]: callus and they might get a little more
too much callus on there at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: they used a nonpolar oxen if you look at
that top right picture you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is growing upside down the roots
are at the top and the shoots are at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom that's one of those things that
most people are not aware of and so they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really think about well I need to
use polar oxens when I'm trying to root
[SPEAKER_00]: things the last one that I really have
noticed is stage four problems or
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation problems where the grower will
actually pull their plant out of the test
[SPEAKER_00]: tube and just expect well it has shoots
and it has roots why can't I treat it like
[SPEAKER_00]: a cutting well these things have been
under a hundred percent humidity there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no reason that you should expect to treat
that like a cutting you have to harden it
[SPEAKER_00]: off like a cutting treat it like a
non-rooted cutting maybe but not one that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just plop out of a tube and stick
it straight in a green house I get the
[SPEAKER_00]: question a lot how long does this take
generally the acclimation stage is that
[SPEAKER_00]: two week period sometimes it can go as
high as three but once you start to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of see the roots grow you know the plants
a lot more hardened off and generally you
[SPEAKER_00]: can plant it at that point germplasm
conservation is one of those things that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people have a lot of interest in in
this industry and there's a lot of factors
[SPEAKER_00]: that go along with this you can put a
plant in test tubes stick it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator and it slows down the
degradation of your media in which case
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant can live a little bit longer so
when you start refrigerating your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a couple basic rules I've kind
of learned from literature and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you need to pay attention to
do not go lower than 40 degrees on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant tissue you're essentially starting
to freeze it and you'll get a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: cell death and I should also mention that
your contamination although slowed down
[SPEAKER_00]: can still be there in a refrigerator I've
stored test tubes for a long period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time in a refrigerated condition and oh
when I pop them out three or four months
[SPEAKER_00]: later I can have a world of contamination
if I didn't keep that refrigerator sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: in some way or another I didn't keep the
room it was in sterile so it's very good
[SPEAKER_00]: to know you need to do this in a pretty
clean I'd recommend ISO five standard lab
[SPEAKER_00]: or better the other one that a lot of
people ask is can you freeze these
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures cryo preserve on that sort of
stuff I have actually never personally
[SPEAKER_00]: tried cryo preserving cannabis tissue
culture but what I have found in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature is there's all sorts of issues
with either freezing or thawing that
[SPEAKER_00]: causes the vacuoles to burst and that
causes a lot more problems in the long
[SPEAKER_00]: term for even trying this out so whenever
I'm starting somebody out in the lab or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot I just recommend they go room
temperature no more than refrigerator and
[SPEAKER_00]: just work with that develop their
protocols before they try and do long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: storage or commercial propagation or
anything like that because in the end
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just going to be dumping a ton of
money into these labs without actually
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing how to keep the plant alive in
them and why waste your money plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding was another aspect of cannabis
tissue culture that a lot of people have
[SPEAKER_00]: had interest in so kind of touch briefly
on it and that's you can germinate plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in vitro so inside the test tube takes
about eight days for him to get to about
[SPEAKER_00]: the point of the middle picture and you
can screen them for pathogens so medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics I know has a female male
indicator for sex testing and what I found
[SPEAKER_00]: was if I grew them in a test tube I could
pop open the lid take a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue sample run it through PCR and
extract the DNA and be able to see is it
[SPEAKER_00]: male or female since it does not detect
hemaphrodites it was a you know somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: biased test but at the same time male or
female for those for the sex of that
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling that allowed you to separate the
seedlings out in your room and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: then grow all female or produce a much
higher quality breeding program the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one is green pod sewing where you can
actually pollinate a female plant and wait
[SPEAKER_00]: a week until the seed starts to develop
the embryo develops first and in the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: coat develops around the embryo when you
pull the seed early and the embryo is
[SPEAKER_00]: developed you can actually put that in
culture and grow it out and you can cut
[SPEAKER_00]: months off your breeding cycles every
generation because you're not waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed coat to develop with all the
nutrients hormones and vitamins the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: needs in order to grow and keep it alive
within the seed coat itself so the big one
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm going to talk about is a
cost-benefit analysis of tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have a couple different labs that
I've set up and I try and do you know all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way from small scale to medium scale I
try to avoid the large-scale propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: currently because I don't know anybody
that has a completed protocol that can get
[SPEAKER_00]: any strain you want or any cultivar you
want through the entire process from start
[SPEAKER_00]: to finish without a hitch and when people
are asking about times how long can I get
[SPEAKER_00]: a return on my investment those sort of
deals when you start to get these numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: and throw them out there you don't want to
give a false impression of what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually providing so what I would
recommend is go with the essentially 35 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 thousand dollar lab if you really want
to start and figure out what protocols you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to make or how to go about making
them you can always go a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper if you need to but that forty
thousand dollar range allows you to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: good hood a good autoclave and really put
your plants through culture efficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: and successfully well having the ability
to trial some other medias and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones just to make sure you're not
basically shooting yourself in the foot
[SPEAKER_00]: that being said if you go more expensive
labs you are still able to do in-house
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding techniques you're still able to
do production and all that and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: start at the low scale your equipment does
not become senile or obsolete over time
[SPEAKER_00]: you can still use the old hood and the old
autoclave as you're expanding to a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: lab to get the results that you're really
looking for so that being said I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple more minutes here and I'm just
curious on if anybody has questions I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: love to take some
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi you mentioned the endo pathogens you're
seeing in the system that contaminate the
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture are those plant pathogens
that will eventually be reflected in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant or are those just a problem in the
tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a pathogen that you will see
eventually reflected in the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes they are beneficial and
sometimes they are toxic so if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: present it makes your tissue culture
process much more complicated much harder
[SPEAKER_00]: initially they're in the plant when you
took the culture when you took the X plant
[SPEAKER_00]: so when it was before in vitro before
stage one you have the plant to grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: that pathogen is present by cutting it out
and putting it in a tube you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that it's there rather than
eliminating it all together there are
[SPEAKER_00]: methods of eliminating using antibiotics
or other things but those are all
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols that still have to be developed
for cannabis specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay one quick follow-up to that I'm sure
not in your tissue culture operations but
[SPEAKER_02]: in general in the industry are there
certain pathogens that are appearing in
[SPEAKER_02]: product put out by the current nursery
practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I can't speak for tissue culture
being put out per se but I do know there
[SPEAKER_00]: are quite a few present Fusarium is one
among them I've actually cultured that out
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and look for that I've also heard
confirmation of other growers finding
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium in their plants different species
of bacillus I think phytophthora is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty big one as well and those are all
the know all that I know off the top of my
[SPEAKER_00]: head but I'm sure there's a plethora of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you comment on the addition of
beneficial symbionts at any of the stage
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial additions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah sure so every time that I have gone
to I should mention I've worked in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria culture lab and when I did that
we had to make specific media and
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics to make it so other bacteria
didn't grow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're making tissue culture media
there's no antibiotics you're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a cocktail that everything loves
to grow in including fungus and bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're perpetuating the problem if you
add those inoculants right before you take
[SPEAKER_00]: the culture itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there an optimal stage like at your
rooting stage or whatever that you can add
[SPEAKER_01]: it before you you actually go ahead and
root in matrix and soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot you have to add them in your
soil itself because under in vitro
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that media will grow whatever
you're trying to add and take over the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is not really a tissue culture
solution it's a matrix it's a post rooting
[SPEAKER_01]: in the matrix solution as you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you determining whether the
viruses are there or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this just a visual detection?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with respect to the slide that
you had with which I love the you had your
[SPEAKER_03]: cost benefit analysis there is the
automated step I assume that liquid
[SPEAKER_03]: handling or sample prep is a big part of
that protocol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you speak to any software that you've
seen or systems that are being used in a
[SPEAKER_03]: high throughput way to do some of that
method development and protocol work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually yes I have so I found it on a
YouTube video actually that's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: readily available if anybody wants to look
for it of a couple very large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: production labs that have automated media
pouring techniques that they do and so
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll pre make the media in the autoclave
and then pipe it as a flat moves along
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a line and that flat fills every
single tube and all of a sudden you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have anybody filling tubes you have people
picking them up setting them on the rack
[SPEAKER_00]: and pulling them off the rack pre-filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then would you repeat your other
question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah so you mentioned that you found
disease I'm sorry viruses when you've
[SPEAKER_03]: identified these viruses I'm wondering is
this visual detection or are you actually
[SPEAKER_03]: doing some kind of more validated?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple different techniques
you can actually use the first one would
[SPEAKER_00]: be visual identification but there are
strips that you can actually use to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: are there viruses in those plants and they
have a 99.8% accuracy I've trialed some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those and confirmed there was no virus in
the first place so it could just be you
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that it looked like that sometimes
because those strips are so specific you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually need to take it to a commercial
virus testing laboratory and have them run
[SPEAKER_00]: an analysis to see is there a virus in
there and they can only test four things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're that they think might be in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those virus testing laboratories
again I used to work for something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not able to figure out random
viruses or things that they don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what to look for so I guess the short
answer to that is yes you can visually try
[SPEAKER_00]: and detect and identify and sometimes
that'll work but I always recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a third-party lab to really make
sure that your culture is in fact virus
[SPEAKER_00]: free and if you're gonna try and do it
in-house at least use a strip test they
[SPEAKER_00]: cost a couple bucks a piece make sure you
don't have a virus in your plant tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: before you go selling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well there's obviously controversy over
whether some viruses are systemic and
[SPEAKER_03]: whether you can get rid of them so you
know I think it can be a touchy issue as
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're saying that tissue culture can
completely remediate a virus because
[SPEAKER_03]: similar to the problem of the variability
within you know these chemovars that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're culturing you're going to see
probably some some phenotypical
[SPEAKER_03]: differences there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I would completely agree with that
actually and even when you go to take your
[SPEAKER_00]: meristem culture at times if you take too
much tissue you still haven't cultured out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the virus so it's very important to
know using either strip tests or
[SPEAKER_00]: third-party labs that you did in fact
culture out of that and not just relying
[SPEAKER_00]: on your eyes to you know tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
