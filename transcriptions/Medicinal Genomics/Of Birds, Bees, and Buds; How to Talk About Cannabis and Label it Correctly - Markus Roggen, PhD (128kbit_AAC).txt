[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time for me in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot, it's flat, but I came prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read up on the Florida men.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my guiding impression for this
visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, as the talk might indicate,
maybe we talk about sex education,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I only have 20 minutes, so I probably
get it through before DeSantis signs the
[SPEAKER_00]: law banning this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no, we're talking math.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question I have to you,
and you can write down the answer
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, and then at the end I tell you
you're wrong, in one of the later slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Mary Jane goes to a store and
buys an eighth of lemon OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain has 23.3% total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: She rolls a half-gram joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: She takes three puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much THC has she inhaled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like all the other talks over the
last few days was all about consumption of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and how much you should take.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a low-dose talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can anyone answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually show you the data at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is a hard one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go for an easier one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to buy a Boba Kush with
20.2% THC for $4.20, or a lemon OG with
[SPEAKER_00]: 23% for $7.10, and yes, these prices are
made up because the numbers are funny,
[SPEAKER_00]: which one gives you more bang for your
buck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now, that is what a cannabis
consumer buys for, and the industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to sell to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the total THC number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the less potent THC is actually
the better for the bang of the buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, they shouldn't have bought
the higher one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have bought the lower one if
they just wanted more THC for the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is weird, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I find this curious why the industry is
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the whole talk will be about why
are you doing this, why this is wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how can we do it better?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a summary of what we're going to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about, I will tell you
how cannabis is bought today, why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong, how could we do this better,
and I will fight you for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Florida men who got convicted for
assault with a deadly rifle by throwing an
[SPEAKER_00]: alligator through a drive-through window.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, that's not efficient,
and I'm all about efficiency, so I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't use the alligator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm German, I'm kind of a stereotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a PhD in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm German, and I'm all about efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my lab does all process
optimization, analytical development,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the other fun stuff of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't do this alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this in collaboration with other
research institutions and researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verdean Science presented yesterday,
Mike Tagen, and I'm a good friend with his
[SPEAKER_00]: colleague, Linda Klumpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also at this slide, I just noticed
that all the speakers from the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have private companies that presented
their work, and then all the Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers, so I'm German, but I live in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all are from universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The university did this research,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with UBC, because there it is
federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the licenses, and we're allowed to
do this work.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily for you, I'm actually not going
through all the hard experiments that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been doing, so we can skip all the
chemometrics and the kinetic studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's more of a theoretical or
conceptual talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as I see a camera back there,
you don't actually have to take pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is being filmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I upload this to SlideShare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be on my website at some point,
and the last slide has all the references,
[SPEAKER_00]: so take a picture of the last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, and in Canada, we are licensed
to do mushroom and psychedelic research,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I have those compounds in my safe as
well, but for another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we buy cannabis today?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go in a store, it's all about the
total THC number, how much THC by weight
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage is in the flower, in the joint,
in the vape cartridge, and that seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the number that everyone wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone seems to be complaining about
it, because the producer needs to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: higher number, but the testing lab is not
giving it, so the producer tries other
[SPEAKER_00]: things, or the testing lab will
artificially inflate these numbers just to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been enough articles in the
recent memory that showed that the label
[SPEAKER_00]: claim is incorrect, that laboratories are
cheating and getting caught for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that producers are cheating and getting
caught for it, all that just because you
[SPEAKER_00]: need this high number.
[SPEAKER_00]: But does this number actually make any
sense, or do we even need this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we think of other industries,
do they do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in pharma, do they sell by weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, it turns out two of these
packages, actually all three packages,
[SPEAKER_00]: half the milligram of the active substance
on their packaging, but that's not the one
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the melatonin with the 20 milligram
right there on the label, but the others,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't really care about the number,
you just know that you need that compound
[SPEAKER_00]: or that drug, not how much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one, so I like to ask
questions and participation by the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience, which is the best wine to buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I took this picture from a website,
the 10 most expensive wines in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I think four of them are red and
there's one white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is the best wine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of you are wrong because it's the
vodka that has the most alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go by the logic of the cannabis
industry, that is the best product to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go in a wine store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you already see where I want to get
to, if you sell by THC weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't sell the right product,
you can't really advertise your product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't distinguish your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other point is that the total
THC number is actually mathematically
[SPEAKER_00]: incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easiest exemplified by a pure
crystal of THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might know the total THC number is the
THC percentage plus the THC acid
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage with a weight correction
because THC acid gets lighter when it
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pure THC acid crystal has 87.7% total
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can a pure substance be 88% pure?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you didn't listen in middle school
chemistry and in middle school math,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to correct for the weight loss of
the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you subtract weight on the nominator,
you also have to do that on the
[SPEAKER_00]: denominator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this formula actually is corrected and
now it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very esoteric, very geeky, why do we care?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're underselling your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your cannabis would be bumped up in
total THC number if you do the correct
[SPEAKER_00]: math.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we meet again our Lamino G and
Babakush.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bump up by nearly a percent point if
you have the higher potency, higher
[SPEAKER_00]: potency, I'll get to that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kultubaz, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe to wake you up or why do we care?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we sell cannabis by percentage point of
THC and that defines the value,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we did, we scraped websites,
online stores of cannabis companies to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out if there's a correlation between
the sales price and the THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is, it's about 33 cents per
percent point of THC that your sales price
[SPEAKER_00]: increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the industry is losing $400 million a
year by not correctly calculating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, economists would agree that then
the prices would adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so right now, 400 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of that number because you didn't
listen in school and didn't get your math
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the banned books here in Florida,
they ban all the math books.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a bad side to everything
because your hemp is hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed you that we work with the
university.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a lot of co-op students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are undergrad students that have
to work four or eight months in a company
[SPEAKER_00]: to get work experience and that counts as
credits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I have students that work in
cannabis and get a degree for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're super cheap because I pay them
a good wage, but I get half the wage back
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Canadian government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Canadian government sponsors a lot
of our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just think of that, that blows your
mind as an American.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis, you buy flour, you buy it by
percentage weight of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You buy a cartridge and that is either in
percentage weight THC or it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy a brownie, it's a milligram per
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a tincture, it's milligrams
per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you need an advanced degree to just
keep track of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had talks this morning and
yesterday of how much cannabis to take and
[SPEAKER_00]: like how do you square that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you have an idea how one correlates
to the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a brownie, five milligrams per unit
or a tincture, both ingested, tincture is
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's a different unit type,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really difficult to keep track of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some ideas for new approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying I'm right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying you are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to change this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first idea is sell the bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sell that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yesterday evening and for some reason
some of you all through the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: you enjoyed some alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone or you should be aware of the
idea or the concept of a standard drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, intuitively, you can drink a
larger volume of beer than you can drink
[SPEAKER_00]: vodka or scotch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because standard drink is a constant unit
of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that a large amount of beer and a small
shot of whiskey have the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just correct for the ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you vary the weight or the volume of
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we take that concept and now
call it the standard dank, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: package cannabis by a consistent amount of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you don't sell an eighth of flour,
but you sell a fixed amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your unit packaging might go from
three grams to four grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't actually care about the THC
percentage anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer won't feel cheated because
they get the same amount of buzz every
[SPEAKER_00]: time or the same amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can now start labeling other
things because unit is standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here as an example, your edible
would be one unit of standard dank and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a joint with 20% flour has 40 units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes up for then big cartridges and
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be one idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is firmly a new recreational world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just sell you the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have a lot of medical
presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there more of medical approach to
labeling cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there is because you already
try.
[SPEAKER_00]: You call it a potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not a potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 20% weight percent THC flour is not
less potent than 25% THC flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you all talk about the entourage
reflect and all the other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just concentration what you're
labeling right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we actually label it by potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, let's just quickly take a
step back and think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who of you took their vitamins this
morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much vitamin C did you take?
[SPEAKER_00]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 IU.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does IU mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: No one has an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So IU means International Unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an international unit is a measure of
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing to do with weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing to do with moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is purely based on the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is so that you can compare
different application forms,
[SPEAKER_00]: administration forms, that always give you
the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pill or a tincture would give you the
same international units or the same
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the weight between the two products
might actually change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you always get the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could we use that in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we call that an intoxication unit,
we standardize it and just say that a dose
[SPEAKER_00]: effect is 100 IUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we just think an IU is you get
buzzed and five milligrams of an edible
[SPEAKER_00]: make you buzzed, how much is that in a
joint?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe a puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm guessing here because I don't
actually consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I assume that a brownie or a piece of
gummy and a puff on a joint is about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same buzz, rightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just define that as 100 IUs between
the two products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we would sell our products in
multiples of these intoxication units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it allows a consumer to go from a
joint to a tincture to an edible and knows
[SPEAKER_00]: that they always get the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we're talking about for the
last few years to standardize the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could do that with an intoxication
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for CBD, we ramp up the number because
the clinical doses for CBD are way higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just hide that underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now, the consumer has to
remember that they should take five
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of THC, but probably way over
100 milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just all hide that under IUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's difficult, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we should do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to be medical or
pharmaceutical, we should put some effort
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because back to our initial question on
the smoking side, I have a robot that
[SPEAKER_00]: smokes joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I promise you, it's not my colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked cannabis, both high THC and high
CBD flour, and looked at how the particle
[SPEAKER_00]: size, so the mil size, of the flour that
we put in the joint, affects the delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC or CBD to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the particle size affects the
inhalation massively.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can double the THC delivered per puff
by just milling it finer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our initial question, what does Mary
Jane get, can't be answered because we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't mention in that math question the
particle size of the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I don't care if your joint
is 20% THC or 25% or 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The architecture is as important for the
delivery as the flour ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the recoveries are really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cap is consistent with other
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 30% to maybe 50% of the THC that's
in the flour actually ends up in your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest is just combusted and goes off to
other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're wasting a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, and I do not understand why,
CBD is way more efficient in inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: More CBD gets transported, and the
recovery is quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no clue why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lab, and we will get to that
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also do that for tinctures
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a peer-reviewed study we did on a
randomized triple-blind comparatively,
[SPEAKER_00]: parallel studies, like all the buzzwords
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually checked how different
formulations of CBD in liquid lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: blood plasma numbers of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you can do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So parting thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the only one who says that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also people from the Emerald
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex Dixon from SC Labs says that over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might sell the first product on the
THC number, but your returning customers
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming on other factors, like
terpenes, like flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the THC number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stop advertising it or using that as
your prime real estate on your packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, right now, the consumer that has
been using for decades, they know the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: New consumers don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're way more new consumers than
the old consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't go with the argument,
oh, we can't change it because that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: way it always has been, while it also has
always been illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we managed to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have way more potential customers
coming our way than the old ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we should put an effort in and
change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't sell weight and percentage
CSV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sell convenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a summary, standard dank is the
mass of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And intoxication units would be the
resulting effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I thank my co-founder,
Professor Glensamis, and the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: research team that helped me in these
experiments and kept quizzing me why
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is done this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, this is the one for the
picture with the references.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made it exactly on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
