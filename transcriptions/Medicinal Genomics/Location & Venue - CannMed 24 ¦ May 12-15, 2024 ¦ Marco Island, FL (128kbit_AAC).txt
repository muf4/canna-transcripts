[SPEAKER_02]: Great location.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have stepped it up year after
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that you can do much better
than this, but looking forward to seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: what happens next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it'll be the same location.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the last couple years we're in
Pasadena.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pasadena is a fine city.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got the Rose Bowl Parade and all
that, but Miracle Island is the next level
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beaches are white.
[SPEAKER_04]: People can come here to our conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can bring their families and
participate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes that much time and that close
proximity to keep everyone together.
[SPEAKER_05]: This would not happen in Las Vegas and
it's beautiful out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, please do it here again next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, I love it so much that I'm
staying till Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I extended my trip by like four days so I
could enjoy this because I mean I would
[SPEAKER_01]: have never come here if it weren't for
this conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never been here before so it's
fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great choice for this kind of
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calmness of the area and the beauty of
the area gave a little bit of,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, focus and concentration for
us to at the same time have a great time
[SPEAKER_00]: and then being able to do our discussions
in a better way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful location.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm quite impressed with this whole
complex that we are at and it's been very
[SPEAKER_03]: well organized, very professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have run meetings through my career on a
yearly basis and this is quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'll bring some of my other
societies here one day because it has
[SPEAKER_03]: worked out quite well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
