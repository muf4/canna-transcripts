[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to focus on mostly synthetic
chemistry and finish up with a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of biological activity in mice,
not men.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm here to tell you today about
a new cannabinoid that we've discovered,
[SPEAKER_00]: hexahydro-cannabinoic acid or cannabinoid
acid, which you get from hydrogenation of
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA, which is the form of THCA that's
expressed in the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this compound is hydrogenated,
it makes hexahydro-cannabinoic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what we're going to talk about
today, is the hydrogenation of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, which turns the
tetrahydrocannabinoids that we're very
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with into hexahydro-cannabinoids,
because we're adding a molecule of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen to the north double bond of the
ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do this on cannabis extracts that
contain terpenes, terpenoids, and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids, those compounds have double
bonds, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to get a little chemical on you,
what a double bond is, is that's two
[SPEAKER_00]: carbons that are doubly bonded to each
other, and when you react that with
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen, it saturates the double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all of these compounds, terpenes and
terpenoids and flavonoids that are present
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis plant, there are multiple
double bonds, and so when we hydrogenate
[SPEAKER_00]: an extract that's enriched with THCA or
CBDA, if we're using that type of variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also hydrogenate the other compounds
there, and what we'd like to do is exploit
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call the ensemble effect,
which we prefer over the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the multiple compounds that are
provided in the cannabis plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: provides biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do know that there is a synergistic
effect of these compounds, and what we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do is explore hydrogenation as a
very simple and scalable, widely practiced
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction to be able to chemically
transform the oil that we get from
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction of the cannabis plant to
improve efficacy, stability, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacokinetic profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where did this idea come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at DuPont Central Research for
about 18 and a half years, and one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: projects I worked on was the hydrogenation
of catmint oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So catmint, very similar to cannabis,
expresses its oil in glandular
[SPEAKER_00]: trichlorides, and that comes on the
surface of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enriched with a monoterpenoid that we
call nipetalactone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nipetalactone is actually what's
responsible for the excitation in cats,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by the way, it goes clear up the
feline kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just your little domestic friend
at home, but big cats, when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to catmint, want to listen to jazz
and eat Twinkies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting notion, too,
because these iridoid, oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: These iridoid monoterpenes of
nipetalactone are also found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: secretion of insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found is that when we take
catmint oil, which we harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a field in the Punjab region of
India where we're developing a supply
[SPEAKER_00]: chain of catmint oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some local workers who are
distilling the catmint oil in a steam
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take the steam distilled catmint oil
and we hydrogenate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we hydrogenate it, we take this
material now, the hydrogenated catmint
[SPEAKER_00]: oil, and here's some references that
describe the efficacy against biting
[SPEAKER_00]: ticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really good efficacy against the
mosquito that carries both West Nile virus
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Zika virus as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hydrogenated catmint oil is a
registered insect repellent with the EPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: EPA regulates insect repellents because it
falls into the bucket of insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And DuPont did not commercialize this,
but they've licensed this to a company
[SPEAKER_00]: called Entomol, and Entomol is basically
looking to develop a supply chain both
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the West as well as over in Asia
of catmint oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just snap your fingers and have
80 million pounds of catmint oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to basically build up the
agronomy to be able to deliver that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look for this material to be launched
in the next year or two and to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: DEET as the preferred insect repellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of like where this idea
came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the hydrogenation of catmint oil is
karyothaline, which is a very ubiquitous
[SPEAKER_00]: sesquiterpinoid that's also found in the
extract of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found when we hydrogenate
catmint oil is we hydrogenate this terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're able to actually observe all
four of these diastereomers and NMR and we
[SPEAKER_00]: grab the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: patent on it too as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I became known as the hydrogenator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me something and I hydrogenate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, another thing we hydrogenate,
we take the essential amino acid lysine
[SPEAKER_00]: and notice there's no double bond in
lysine, but what we have is a carboxylic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid here and by changing our catalyst
conditions in the hydrogenation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could reduce a carboxylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think again, by changing the
conditions, we can now do different
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry to cannabinoid acids to reduce
their acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it turns out, we can take this diamine,
which we call lysinol, and replace
[SPEAKER_00]: petrochemical derived diamines that are
about three times more expensive in the
[SPEAKER_00]: billion dollar market of epoxy resins
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is currently being commercialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the hydrogenator.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the only tool you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me a biological feedstock and I'm
the hydrogenator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna hydrogenate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about hydrogenated cannabis
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my chemical great, great
grandfather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my PhD advisor is advisor, advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's chemical genealogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the late Roger Adams and you have
to think that, again, in 1940,
[SPEAKER_00]: these papers came out in about 1940 to 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how close his structure to THC was 20
years before Mishulam discovered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that his structure of THC is
totally correct except for the placement
[SPEAKER_00]: of the double bond, which we know is
between these two carbons, not between
[SPEAKER_00]: these two distal carbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Raphael Mishulam in 1964 had the luxury
of 60 megahertz NMR to be able to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: where that double bond was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, Raphael stands on the
shoulders of Roger Adams here because
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Adams came up with the structures of
the cannabinoids, including the structure
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with the double bond in the wrong
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the structure of the fully
hydrogenated material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But notice it's not the hydrogenated THC
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hydrogenated THC, which we call
hexahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Mishulam group did look at
hydrogenation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 19, or I'm sorry, in 2006 reported
these hydrogenated derivatives of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't CBD acid, it was CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hydrogenated CBD to make,
in this case, H-CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see here is that there's two sets
of double bonds in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have this exocyclic methylene
and the cyclohexene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually developed conditions to
select effectively hydrogenate one olefin
[SPEAKER_00]: over the other, which is a nice little
piece of synthetic chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that these compounds,
again, like CBD, control inflammation and
[SPEAKER_00]: other anti-inflammatory activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people had looked at these
hexahydrocannabinoids as potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kim group later on looked at
hexahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not the cannabinol acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hexahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice how this has got a wedge coming up,
and that's got a hash going into the
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the diastereomers that you make
when you hydrogenate THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a little bit of the methyl up,
and you get a little bit of the methyl
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be separated by column
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this group showed that they were
potent anti-cancer agents and looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: models that were looking at angiogenesis,
which is the tumor's ability to reroute
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular plumbing to feed it with a fresh
blood supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looked like this was going to be an
area of interesting biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our concept was to basically take whole
plant extract and not purify the
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, but then do a direct
hydrogenation to make what we call 8-CO,
[SPEAKER_00]: or hydrogenated cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternatively, we can take the whole plant
extract, decarboxylate it to now remove
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2 and then do a hydrogenation to
make decarboxylated 8-CO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the notion is that we're going to
transform what Mother Nature has already
[SPEAKER_00]: provided by doing the heavy lifting,
providing these wonderful compounds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to do a chemical modification of
those compounds to create, hopefully,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that has improved properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a representation of a bunch of
structures that are found in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, most notably Delta-9-THCA,
Delta-9-CBDA, and a host of variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes that I point out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is certainly not an exclusive list.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many, many compounds in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we take this mixture and all of
these things where you see two lines
[SPEAKER_00]: between carbons, these are called double
bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we hydrogenate these,
it turns into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've completely saturated all of those
double bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've turned the
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid into
[SPEAKER_00]: hexahydrocannabinolic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a cannabinoid that no longer has
the double bond here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to point out that with
the carboxylic acid here,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I did a search in SciFinder,
this is a thrilling thing for a synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: chemist like myself, to do a search on
SciFinder and to find zero hits in
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found an abstract on this compound,
which is a hydrogenation away from THCA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the star of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realizing that this is a novel
composition of matter, we had to file a
[SPEAKER_00]: patent on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friends in the pharmaceutical
industry don't try to scoot me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone ever look at a billion dollar
molecule before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come up and look at it if you want to look
at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's little white crystals on the bottom
of a flask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hexahydrocannabinolic acid,
new composition of matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I stumbled into something pretty
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's talk about the hydrogenation
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is this is called a par
shaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this is is basically a vessel here
that we can put under a pressure of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen and shake it because we have a
catalyst in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get the catalyst mixing with the
elements in the reaction, we have to shake
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use this thing called a par shaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see, this is called thin layer
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is we spot the reactions
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we elute with a solvent in this
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find is that the starting
material doesn't run quite as fast as the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogenated product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives us an indication that our
reaction's complete because here we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture of both the starting material and
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have just starting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see no starting material present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that our reaction's complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could isolate our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run a lot of what's called nuclear
magnetic resonance, proton NMR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proton NMR of this stuff is amazingly
clean, amazingly clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sound like Donald Trump, don't I?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so here's the carbon through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here's the carbon 13 NMR, which again,
the non-synthetic chemist may not be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to appreciate, but this is extremely,
extremely clean product.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so here's what the material looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a white crystalline solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a sharp melting point between 60
and 63 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's we've made a bunch of the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to report that I've consumed
this material and to tell you that it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives me a psychological effect similar to
consuming a THC type material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could feel at a very high dab dose kind
of like ringing in my limbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my beard feels crispy, which is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never felt a crispy beard, but OK,
again, very, very pure compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we identify things by its molecular
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the molecular weight is a unique
molecular weight because we've added a
[SPEAKER_00]: mole of hydrogen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the corresponding THCA compound would
be 358.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add a mole of hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move the molecular weight up to 360.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, we see M minus 1,
which is 359 because this is in the minus
[SPEAKER_00]: mode of the mass spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just high resolution mass spec,
which again, just identifies the compound
[SPEAKER_00]: as being the correct mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we decarboxylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we decarboxylate, we make
hexahydrocannabinol, which is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's two nice aromatic
signals, two nice aromatic signals,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just a beautiful set of signals here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very, very, very clean compound,
also psychologically active or
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we dab this, we have the same
profound effect, maybe a little bit slower
[SPEAKER_00]: than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it maybe lasts a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we've done this to CBD as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange light, yellow light, moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this to CBD, and we've done this
to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the biological
effects of these materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recall the Kim assay showed that these
compounds were anti-angiogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they speculated in a paper that it
was acting on VGEF, but I don't think they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually knew the mechanism of its
anti-angiogenic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we looked in these
little guys right here and looked at a
[SPEAKER_00]: very aggressive form of brain tumor called
gliobastoma multiform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a test where we used the
vehicle that we were injecting into the
[SPEAKER_00]: mice just as a control, and then looked at
comparing THC to the HHCA and CBDA to the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogenated versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here all we're doing is we're
sacrificing the animals, taking the tumors
[SPEAKER_00]: out, and weighing them, and just looking
for a change in tumor weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we observed is that left unchecked,
the tumors will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when treated with cannabinoids at this
arbitrary rate of 10 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram body weight, that we do see
lowering of the tumor sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it looks as though the
hydrogenation improves the activity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-hydrogenated cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's more apparent in this chart
right here where you can see hydrogenation
[SPEAKER_00]: providing a slight improvement to THC
activity, and hydrogenation here providing
[SPEAKER_00]: a much more marked improvement to CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're following up this work in a
collaboration with Professor Roger
[SPEAKER_00]: Pertwee, University of Aberdeen in
Scotland, to get CB1 binding numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a bunch of assays sort of in
the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also doing some more follow-up
work to understand what type of mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: might be at work in controlling these
tumor sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was known quite some time ago in
1991 is hexahydrocannabinol actually does
[SPEAKER_00]: undergo metabolic oxidation, similar to
that of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is apparently,
this is the THC, and what you can see here
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the 11-hydroxy compound is the
major oxidative metabolite component when
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with liver microzones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find with HHC, not the acid,
but with HHC, is we see a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolic profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though there is no double bond
here, we still see oxidation at the 11
[SPEAKER_00]: position and oxidation here at the 8
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically an indiscriminate
oxidation that's still oxidizing these
[SPEAKER_00]: carbons even though there is no double
bond present.
[SPEAKER_00]: But notice that our 11-hydroxy metabolite
is a different 11-hydroxy metabolite than
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up on urine tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea here is you can take this and
pass the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hydrogenated cannabis oil is basically
prepared by hydrogenation of extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It converts the tetrahydrocannabinoids
into hexahydrocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have a new composition of
matter, a billion-dollar molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has similar oxidative metabolism to
THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you it comes with a pretty
fragrant and floral taste and certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: the psychoactive effects that are noted
here on this chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now when you do a search for this
structure in chemical abstracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you find is one reference,
my patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a notice of allowance from the
USPTO just a couple of weeks ago saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have an allowed patent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're an inventor, this is a great
thing to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just like to thank these folks,
Shocker and Mehdi, who did the
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-angiogenic testing at the Albany
College of Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Barone, who I collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from the Clear Concentrates out in
Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is his brand, Barone extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very high-quality cannabis extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Chris Rithner from Discovery 64,
one of my old collaborators from Port
[SPEAKER_00]: Collins, Colorado, and my very talented
patent attorney, who I'm greatly indebted
[SPEAKER_00]: to, and you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
