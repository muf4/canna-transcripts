[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Rob Viglione.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm co-founder of Horizon, formerly
ZenCash, and I'm going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology
in general at CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a few really important themes
that I want to go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is on the payment side and how
applicable cryptocurrency payments are to
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical marijuana industry for a
variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One being that regulations and access to
banking services do very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vary quite significantly across
different states on different parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a kind of a unifying payment
system like cryptocurrencies, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very useful for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second big aspect is blockchain
technology lends itself very well to as an
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurial platform or framework upon
which businesses can now start leveraging
[SPEAKER_00]: the technology and making services easier
for their users.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about these two
general strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one big unifying element to all of
this stuff is the commonality philosophy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, between the Bitcoin world and the
original movement and where we are with
[SPEAKER_00]: Zen and Horizon and where the medical
marijuana industry is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of a fundamental belief in
the right to privacy and personal choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are really big themes that I
think link the industries together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really happy to talk at the
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much for joining us.
Thank you.
