[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks to the maybe 15 of you that
are in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jordan Zager.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with Dewey Scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I'm gonna talk to you guys about how
we can deliver medical quality botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and sort of the steps we need to
take as cultivators and those involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing to actually make that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think to understand this topic,
it's important to look at how the FDA
[SPEAKER_01]: looks at cannabis as medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a slide straight off the FDA's
website where they say there's two routes
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis as medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the eyes of the FDA, there's
cannabis-derived compounds like Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is largely extracts from homogenized
plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or there are cannabis-related compounds
like Marinol and Sesame.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are synthetically produced compounds
that stimulate the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: but don't necessarily come from the plant
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a big problem here in that the
FDA is ignoring botanical cannabis as
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is important because if you look
at the history of medical cannabis dating
[SPEAKER_01]: back to 1996 here in California,
the overwhelming majority of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has been botanically derived,
if not the flower itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: 69% of medical cannabis consumers consume
smoked flower or they vaporize flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention, right, vape pens are
definitely not to the medical quality or
[SPEAKER_01]: purification levels of Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right, the FDA is ignoring botanical
cannabis as a treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to answer that question,
we need to look just at the history of
[SPEAKER_01]: plant-derived medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to the first instance of its
use in Mesopotamia dating back close to
[SPEAKER_01]: 5,000 years, skip ahead 2,000 years and
we're starting to see widespread use of
[SPEAKER_01]: natural product medicine across
civilizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jump up into the 19th century and we have
sort of the first isolation of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant-derived natural product being used
as a medicine in the form of morphine.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, crude plant extracts were very
widespread around the globe by this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jumping into sort of the modern era,
single-molecules natural product medicines
[SPEAKER_01]: are being developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, think of penicillin here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jump to the 80s, we start to see a
decrease in natural product medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 50% of all new drugs are derived
from natural products, however,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, leaving 50% that are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is sort of when chemical
synthesis really takes over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has really been the route of
pharma over the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast forward to about 2007 and over the
previous 10 years, only six plant-derived
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines were approved by the FDA,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So pharma has increasingly moved away from
plant-derived medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right, considering cannabis is a plant
and we are here to talk about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, this is sort of non-congruent
with how I think most of us view natural
[SPEAKER_01]: products in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also evidenced by the fact that
all of these pharma companies here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: left have abandoned their natural product
research programs, while only a handful
[SPEAKER_01]: have actually held onto this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why are we seeing this shift away from
natural product medicines?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's really three confounding
factors here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first off, these lead compounds,
the medicinally active components,
[SPEAKER_01]: are producing incredibly small quantities
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, it's really hard to source and
harvest these natural products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get poor yields, oftentimes leading to
impractical scaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then not to mention, a lot of these
compounds have high site of toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sort of renders synthetic biology
applications moot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's just killing the cells that are
producing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right, if we're relying on a
plant to produce this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: most farmers are going to follow good
agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be using pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be use of heavy metals to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this ultimately contaminates the
natural products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a very good example of this is Taxol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an anti-cancer medicine,
one of the most widely prescribed around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes from the yew tree,
a large family of trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this Taxol is produced primarily in
the needles, but it comes in incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: small quantities with 0.004% yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't even produce the
medicinal component of Taxol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces sort of an intermediary
backbone that then needs to be further
[SPEAKER_01]: decorated through chemical synthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention, right, going back to those
three problems with natural product
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines, these compounds are very
difficult to isolate and purify the
[SPEAKER_01]: compound of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you have here are this,
on our X axis, we have a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: different yew tree species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the taxanes that they produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the species, you're
looking at anywhere from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: four to 11 highly similar compounds that
getting a pure product is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, to make things even tougher,
it has a very elusive biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anywhere you see a reaction that has a
red lettering means that we don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme that catalyzes this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this poses another problem for
synthetic biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't know the gene responsible for
the chemical conversion, we can't engineer
[SPEAKER_01]: a microbe to produce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis doesn't face these
limitations that most plant natural
[SPEAKER_01]: products possess, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, the natural products are
produced in abundance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I put 15% yields here, but we all know
that there are cannabis varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: producing upwards of 30% of a single
molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cannabis products, these are
compounds that are very easy to isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go get pure cannabinoids online
with no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biosynthetic pathway has been very
well characterized.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already have yeast strains that have
been engineered to produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just taking a look at the most
abundant natural products in botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the cannabinoids, things like CBD,
THC, maybe the more minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: like the varins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, a pretty good study came out
showing that terpenes are in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: interacting with the cannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've shown it in a mice model.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've also shown it in in vitro assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still have big sample variation in
botanical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this data outlines here is we
looked at the terpene and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: content of nine commercial varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We applied those values of how much
natural products are accumulating,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're able to visualize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's important here is that
cultivars, generally, group together,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's still variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're considering a medicine from
botanical cannabis and something we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to put into clinical trials, you have to
be able to control this sample variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this goes back, right, to the FDA
statement that they're ignoring botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as a treatment, but can we change
this by reducing natural product variation
[SPEAKER_01]: in the flower itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: My hypothesis is yes, we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can get there by following three
pillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very important because it drives
what can possibly be made, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to produce the varins if
you don't have the proper cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: synthase involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal here is to understand natural
product quality and the overall profile of
[SPEAKER_01]: any given cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second pillar is the environment,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The environment is critical in influencing
sort of the magnitude of the compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: produced, whether it's the terpenes or the
cannabinoids or maybe another class of
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are a little less well studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the overall goal here would be to
reduce the variation of natural product
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles from a single genetic source in a
defined environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that final pillar is post-harvest,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to maintain the consistency of
the levels of bioactive compounds during
[SPEAKER_01]: storage of the product, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And here the goal would be to reduce
variation in the profile through proper
[SPEAKER_01]: storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So diving into that first pillar with
genetics, this is the driving force of
[SPEAKER_01]: natural products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some research that has come out is
largely that the chemotype or the dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid that the plant produces can
sort of be traced back to one of three
[SPEAKER_01]: geographic origins, whether it's China or
Western Europe for CBD producing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: largely what we classify as hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as, right, the THC-containing
varieties having two origins of
[SPEAKER_01]: domestication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Largely in Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you see here with this
phylogenetic tree are the, this is a few
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred cultivars of cannabis that were
genotyped and they fall into clusters that
[SPEAKER_01]: are sort of expectant from three origins
of domestication.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not only that, right, we live in the
genomics era.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can identify what exactly is
contributing to the natural product
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the genetic level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here this is just a chromosome map of
the cannabis genome and where various
[SPEAKER_01]: genes involved in cannabinoids and
terpenes are located.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because a gene may be there doesn't
mean that it's turned on and working.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, right, you might have a CBCA
synthase, but if it's not active,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to produce anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here, right, we have another
phylogenetic tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what this is, these are all the
characterized or identified cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: synthases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from CBD synthase to some of
the enzymes involved in varine production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you see highlighted in blue are
inactive enzymes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back to genetics are driving
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an inactive THC synthase,
right, you're not going to produce THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same could be said with the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far there's been about 33 genes and
proteins that have been functionally
[SPEAKER_01]: characterized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning we know exactly the chemistry
that's that they perform and how they're
[SPEAKER_01]: related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like the cannabinoids,
if a gene is not turned on, you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have data pointing that's very
consistent with this hypothesis that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need the gene to be expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up top here, the top table,
this is terpene accumulation across nine
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bottom table is the gene
expression of the terpene synthase that
[SPEAKER_01]: produces some of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highlighted in green, right, this is
alpha-pinene.
[SPEAKER_01]: In two of these varieties, it accumulates
in incredibly small amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, sure enough, alpha-pinene
synthase is not expressed by those
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same could be said with osamine here,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So gene expression is driving terpene
abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene function is driving cannabinoid
abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and like I mentioned earlier,
these are incredibly well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biosynthetic pathways, we know it
regulates them.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, light regulates the
production of these enzymes that produce
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also primarily produced in
structures called trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're made in one central location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so this leads us to the
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Light influences the production of these
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what data out there can we use to sort
of identify how to reduce that natural
[SPEAKER_01]: product variation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's three critical things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the key factors being light
temperature in something called vapor
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the context of light, the quality of
light that the plant receives,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is right, the specific wavelengths
that are feeding the plant its light
[SPEAKER_01]: source, drives phytochemical or natural
product production in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, terpenes are stimulated by
wavelengths of 600 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here on the right, these are just
the typical light spectra from common
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting sources, whether it's sunlight,
high pressure sodium lamps, or LED
[SPEAKER_01]: fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right, whichever method the cultivator
chooses, it is influencing how much or how
[SPEAKER_01]: little of any given compound is produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is some data from us at Dewey
where we grew the exact same strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: flora deexplora, in two different
environments, one with sun as the primary,
[SPEAKER_01]: light lighting source as the only lighting
source, and then high pressure sodium as
[SPEAKER_01]: the other, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So two very different light spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is impacting and influencing the
terpene profile, where you can see the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences between the two, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain compounds are not made in uniform
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this just goes back to control the
environment, control the exact natural
[SPEAKER_01]: product profile that's being produced by
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so another critical factor here is
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Data with a little grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from conifers, pine trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what these researchers shown was at 30
degrees Celsius, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes are down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in any of these chemical structures,
if there is a red box there, that means
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was increased in production at 30
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the overwhelming majority of these
boxes was blue, meaning that these levels
[SPEAKER_01]: are decreased when grown at 30 degrees
compared to 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final factor is vapor
pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more or less a measurement of how
water is moving through the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is there a drought stress event
impacting the plant during growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, in drought conditions,
you see increases in terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: With some terpenes, some instances you see
decreases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to control the amount of water
the plant is getting as well to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: that natural product variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is some data pulled from our
greenhouses at Dewey, where we have an
[SPEAKER_01]: example of unstable conditions with those
three components compared to stable
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right, there is a method for monitoring
data, and we've created a little scoring
[SPEAKER_01]: system to, we just call it our
environmental growth score, where if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have proper VDP, the flow of water
through the plant, you don't even add,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't even take an example into account
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you nail VPD, you can then start
to score temperature, and eventually,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you get there, you can start to score
lighting interval or humidity of the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right, if you can get every day up into
the red here, it would be a very
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent grow environment, thereby
impacting the natural products produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final pillar here is
post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once the plant's been harvested,
how can we maintain these levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: bioactive metabolites?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very well-known company in the
cannabis space called Boveda.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to say that this will maintain
the freshness of your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more than anything, what this does is
it stabilizes the humidity of the storage
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this matters because depending on how
dry, or even the method you use to dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get different amounts of terpenes
and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this data here, this was done in
collaboration with a company called The
[SPEAKER_01]: Meter Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make sensors for the environment and
in food storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we did was we took first one,
the same variety called White Cap,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we dried it to two different humidity
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's in orange and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you see is, depending on the
dryness of the flower, you get different
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you look within the colored
blocks, these are just different methods
[SPEAKER_01]: used to dry the flower itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the way that you dry it,
and to what degree you dry it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get different cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to sort of summarize all that,
right now the pharmaceutical industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: the FDA is natural product shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And botanical cannabis is currently too
variable to offer what's needed for
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials and actual FDA approval of
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we can overcome that by
controlling the genetics that you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Controlling the growth environment as well
as the post-harvest process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe strongly that advances in
technology can change these first two
[SPEAKER_01]: statements and get the FDA to maybe
consider botanical-derived cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to acknowledge the whole team at
Dewey, as well as Connor from The Meter
[SPEAKER_01]: Group, along with the great research that
sort of fit the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The story that I just told.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will open up to any questions that
you might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for the most part, we do breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a genetics company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We leverage the genome to make informed
and smarter breeding decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to grow plants up the full
12 weeks to identify a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do a DNA extraction at week two and
identify, oh, this is going to be a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that produces high amounts of bosamine,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we are a Washington-based
producer processor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We offer genetics to folks in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a cannabis brand in the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Largely what we're doing right now is
focusing on the traits that help the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer reduce the inputs, overall inputs,
that go into the crop by having plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that are genetically stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the water activity, yep.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually believe that data was for
THC, not total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, in our lab, we test for 16
unique cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could break that down to the exact
molecule, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, oh, another question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to get on the mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any data for LED differences,
actually, or hydro, as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, grow media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see any data at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you guys done any data on LED or
hydro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hydro grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have run experiments, I'm guessing,
with hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mean, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, so exposed root in like an ebb
and flow system or more with like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, controlled drip system in a,
call it rock wall or cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yeah, sort of the gutter model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any data comparing those
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have data comparing sort of native
soil to greenhouse soil compared to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't seen major differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Largely, it is in the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our hypothesis is that the
microbial community impacts sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary metabolites, whether it's
cannabinoids or terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the humidity levels, what's the range?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how tight do you have to keep that
range on the humidity and the drying?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the drying room?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we call it the sweet zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anywhere from 55% to 65% is,
sort of the, at least, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from a recreational cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is going to be the desirable flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything over that 65%, you're enabling
mold or bacteria to grow on the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything below that 55% level sort of just
is like a dusty, not high grade product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, aim for somewhere in that
zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've seen is the relative
humidity of the room after a set amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: time is going to be the relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humidity of that flower itself,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of just thermodynamic
equilibrium that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think number one is stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when most, at least, cannabis
growers talk about stability, their number
[SPEAKER_01]: one concern is, is this cultivar going to
produce male flowers on accident?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to germ, thereby rooting the
crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing to really consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that, you know, our approach is
let's make the farmer happy first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right, we focus on traits like disease
resistance, whether it's powdery mildew or
[SPEAKER_01]: other fungal molds or insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I don't know if I'm on or not,
but I think I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, how do you deliver the genetics to
your customers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you delivering, are you using tissue
culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're checking DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what is the?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, primarily it's clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, right, we're not a nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're not going to find a menu
of 37 varieties that you can buy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, up to 1,000 strains of.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take a licensing approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll oftentimes deliver a tray of flats
or a flat of clones to our partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, thank you all for
listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
