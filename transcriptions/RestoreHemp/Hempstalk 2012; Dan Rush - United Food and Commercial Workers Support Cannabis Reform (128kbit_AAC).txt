[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Dan Rush of the United Food and
Commercial Workers International Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Brother Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody here got a joint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody here having a good time?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about hemp stock, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if they see me on stage,
you know, it's time to talk about politics
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides creating good jobs and working
conditions for working people,
[SPEAKER_00]: and most especially our members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very proud to be the director of
the National Medical Cannabis and Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: Division of the United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I did that, what I did in UFCW
was run statewide ballots like Measure 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody here supporting Measure 80?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're supporting Measure 80, and the
reason we're supporting Measure 80 is
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will create jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody here want a union job with health
insurance and pension?
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're going to do in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we're working in the medical
cannabis and hemp industry, but also right
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're here talking about legalization,
Measure 80, Initiative 502, and Measure 64
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everybody know about Measure 64 and
502?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we're doing is
we've created a slogan that we're using in
[SPEAKER_00]: the union and we're going around the
country talking about, and that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: fix it and pass it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everybody know what that means?
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that we can't lose any
more statewide ballots in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people work as hard as Paul and
Casper and the rest of the folks here that
[SPEAKER_00]: have helped put these events together,
we have to step up and we have to support
[SPEAKER_00]: them in our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every initiative has something that people
don't like about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing to do is when you find an
initiative that's about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's something about it you don't
like, remember, it costs $5 million to $10
[SPEAKER_00]: million to pass something on the ballot,
but it only costs $500,000 to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're telling folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pass it and then fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fight it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been our own worst enemies in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been our own worst enemies in social
justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep finding one sentence in 300 that
we don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is perfect and nothing will ever
be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's crucial in politics for
cannabis in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to pass measure 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to pass measure 502.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to pass amendment 64 and we need
to get together and start doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much and let's restore
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good hemp fest.
