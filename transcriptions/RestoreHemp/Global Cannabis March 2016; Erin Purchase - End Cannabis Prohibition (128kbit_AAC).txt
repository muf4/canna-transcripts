[SPEAKER_00]: Hello Portland, wow thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this is my third year speaking
and this summer marks the fourth year that
[SPEAKER_00]: my daughter is in remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to Cannabis Oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Oil provided my seven-year-old
daughter who was fighting cancer the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to endure two and a half years of
chemotherapy without a single Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that she didn't lose a single
pound and she had a smile on her face the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire time she fought.
[SPEAKER_00]: She finished chemotherapy about a year and
a half ago and just recently we hit one
[SPEAKER_00]: year off treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we hit that mark our oncologist came
and told us that because Michaela replaced
[SPEAKER_00]: brain radiation in high-dose chemotherapy
with cannabis oil she has a lower chance
[SPEAKER_00]: of a secondary cancer relapse because of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of every child that has ever endured
leukemia treatment my daughter has a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of a secondary cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means ten years from now my child's
not gonna have a brain tumor from the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation to treat her leukemia and to me
that is extremely important that every
[SPEAKER_00]: child in our country has that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great here that we have legal
cannabis in the state of Oregon and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke our bowls at home if we're 21 and
older and our children can be on a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: program but that's not the way it is
across our country and our fight is not
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please if there's anything I can urge
everyone to do is to not think our job is
[SPEAKER_00]: done because our job is nowhere near done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our job is not done in our own state and
our job is not done across our country and
[SPEAKER_00]: across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can urge you guys all to use your
voices.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find out somebody has cancer,
seizures, epilepsy, Alzheimer's,
[SPEAKER_00]: any medical condition, urge them to get on
the medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep our medical marijuana program in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saves lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get rid of it my daughter cannot
have her oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been taking cannabis oil for four
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has straight A's.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's doing amazing in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's surpassing all of the expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's just like a normal child and another
importance is this is not just CBD that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter takes THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychoactive THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called a tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you morphine gets the kids
higher than the cannabis oil and I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to experience morphine or addiction
or any of that that comes along with
[SPEAKER_00]: opioid pain medication that they treat
children with in our state and every other
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to shy away from opioid pain
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me for another great
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for attending and marching and
uniting for this great cause.
Thank you so much.
