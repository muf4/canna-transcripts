[SPEAKER_00]: I first smoked pot 45 years ago when I was
a freshman at Georgetown Law School in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, D.C., and I've been a regular
smoker ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing wrong with the
responsible use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 40 years ago next month that normal
was formed, and at the time, so we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: at this now for four decades, and our
position then and our position now is
[SPEAKER_00]: there's absolutely nothing wrong with the
responsible use of marijuana by adults,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it should be of no interest or concern
to the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no business knowing whether we
smoke or why we smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Alan mentioned in his opening comments,
we really are at a tipping point in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more living Americans who have
smoked marijuana than living Americans who
[SPEAKER_00]: have not, and with the increasing support
we have from the public now, we've made
[SPEAKER_00]: more political progress in the last five
years than in the first 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, folks, we are very close to winning
this, closer than it looks like when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're out struggling on the street level,
I understand, but once change begins,
[SPEAKER_00]: it happens more quickly than you
anticipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want to introduce you now to some
of the people who are responsible for the
[SPEAKER_00]: progress we're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't for a moment suggest that these
are the only important projects around the
[SPEAKER_00]: country because, frankly, there are so
many of those, we couldn't possibly have
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone represented on the panel or we
wouldn't have time during the three-day
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend, but this is a fair sample,
I think, of the very good positive
[SPEAKER_00]: progressive work that's going on on this
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first person I'd like to introduce is
because we're here in his home state.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Sageo is the executive director of a
group called Voter Power.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the primary sponsor of Initiative
74, I believe it is, is that right,
[SPEAKER_00]: John?
[SPEAKER_00]: 74 in Oregon, which would create a
state-licensed dispensary system where
[SPEAKER_00]: right now in Oregon, as he'll explain,
I'm sure, they have medical marijuana and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can share it among your friends and
give it away, but nobody is legally
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with some luck in November,
that's going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please welcome John Sageo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Keith, and welcome all you normal
attendees.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any of you that are my age or a
little older, you might remember the last
[SPEAKER_01]: time Normal had the annual conference in
Portland was 1986, and back then,
[SPEAKER_01]: we also had a measure on the ballot to
legalize personal use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the main person on that,
and we've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That year, we got 26.3% yes vote,
and it was a real sobering lesson,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it's exciting to be with you all
here now when we are on the verge of not
[SPEAKER_01]: only being on the ballot but winning the
election, so this is an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume you're all here because you love
marijuana and you would like to legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me tell you, when I started out
as a young activist many decades ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at it and tried to figure out,
well, how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we go to our legislators?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we go to Congress?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we bring court cases where the laws are
thrown out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I quickly realized that the way we're
going to legalize marijuana is using the
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative process, and that has been how
most of the major gains have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we got, you know, Prop 215 in
California brought us the first medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have 14 states plus DC,
and most of them came with initiatives,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we need to embrace the initiative
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people are far ahead of the
politicians on this issue, and that's how
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to legalize marijuana,
and this is an exciting year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not 100% sure, but I think
we have marijuana on the ballot in four
[SPEAKER_01]: states, and I think that's the most we've
ever had on in one time, so that's another
[SPEAKER_01]: measure of progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm just going to try to share some
things I've learned over the years about
[SPEAKER_01]: using the initiative process and what we
need to know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, it costs a lot of money,
and up until recently, most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: initiatives were not funded by us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't funded by, you know,
a grassroots movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were funded by a small number of big
funders, Peter Lewis, Soros, and Sperling,
[SPEAKER_01]: and thank God for those, you know,
really wise, rich men, but it's time for
[SPEAKER_01]: this movement to move past that funding
source, and frankly, we're having to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: whether we like it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got on the ballot by doing it
ourselves, and we did get a grant from MPP
[SPEAKER_01]: and a grant from DPA, but in this
initiative that we just put on the ballot,
[SPEAKER_01]: we raised the lion's share of the money
from small contributors and a few
[SPEAKER_01]: benefactors, and one of my messages is
that if we want to legalize marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have to pay for it,
and it's not going to be cheap,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm hoping that we can go away from
this conference with everybody realizing
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have the power, just those of us
at this conference, to do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we need to shift our spending a little
bit, and we need to all make sure we spend
[SPEAKER_01]: as much on legalization as we spend,
for example, at the Governor Hotel,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if we do that, we'll be pretty close
to legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, part of my pitch to you all is
we need your help.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things that's going
on with this initiative is we barely got
[SPEAKER_01]: on the ballot, we're nearly broke,
and we're in a very, very difficult,
[SPEAKER_01]: tough campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think we can win, and there's lots of
evidence that shows we can, but we need
[SPEAKER_01]: you to help us raise some money,
so we're having an after-party tonight at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Modish building, which is about three
blocks from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're passing out flyers, so come on down,
and, you know, we'll be continuing the
[SPEAKER_01]: conference after it stops here,
and have speakers, and things you can bid
[SPEAKER_01]: on, and all that usual stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, we need your help,
so please step up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what does our initiative do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our initiative, you know, we've had the
Oregon Medical Marijuana Act for 12 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a great law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has stopped patients from being
arrested for using their medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it hasn't done is created a system
where all patients get medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they get it conveniently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now have over 45,000 patients in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's the highest per
capita among the states, but it's right up
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a system that requires these
people to produce their own medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a felony for anybody to sell it
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been struggling with that for 12
years, making the best of it, and we do
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of organizations
that try to help patients, but it just
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's no question that
requiring patients to produce their own
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine keeps marijuana, medical
marijuana, in the dark ages, and we look
[SPEAKER_01]: forward to a future where patients can
grow it themselves if they want,
[SPEAKER_01]: but where they can go buy it and where
they can buy advanced products that
[SPEAKER_01]: research and development and innovators
like some of you out there are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be a better world,
and we're going to make it happen November
[SPEAKER_01]: 2nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really exciting aspects of
this campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've done a lot of polling,
and, you know, one of the things I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: to say is that part of politics is our
issue, but a bigger part of politics is
[SPEAKER_01]: realizing that we're a little issue in a
big C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, one of the things we're up
against is the decline of the Democratic
[SPEAKER_01]: Party in the national sphere, and,
you know, the Republicans are highly
[SPEAKER_01]: motivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out for blood, and they're all
going to be voting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We polled on our issue right after the
November 2008 election, and we were
[SPEAKER_01]: polling at 59-32.
[SPEAKER_01]: We polled in June, and we're only ahead
46-41.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not because people have changed
their attitudes about medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because young people Democrats are
not planning on voting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one lesson there is the key to us
winning this election, and I imagine it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the key to Prop 19 winning in California,
is we have to mobilize the young voters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to register them, and we have to
get out the vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're directing a lot of effort in our
campaign at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have petitioners out collecting emails
and registering voters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just collected emails from about 5,000
people at the state fair, and now we have
[SPEAKER_01]: an email list approaching 20,000,
and we're going to keep building on that
[SPEAKER_01]: to where we can send out emails and remind
people to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oregon, we are lucky because we have
only vote by mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't go to the polls at all,
so we have about a two-week window where
[SPEAKER_01]: people have their ballots, and we're going
to spend a lot of our resources on getting
[SPEAKER_01]: people that we know are supporters out to
vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we do that, that will easily
overcome the fact that we're not over 50
[SPEAKER_01]: percent in our polling numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been another test of this campaign
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last month, a new part of the initiative
process here in Oregon was called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Citizens Initiative Review, where another
nonprofit organization partnering with the
[SPEAKER_01]: state government selected 24 voters at
random to demographically match the state
[SPEAKER_01]: of Oregon, and those folks studied this
initiative for a solid week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had many hours of testimony.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had expert witnesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought out all kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought Mary Lynn Mathri from Patients
Out of Time and Mike Kravitz from Veterans
[SPEAKER_01]: for Access to Medical Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought Don Duncan from ASA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the other side, they talked to
Andrea Barthwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They talked to, you know, Chris's police
chief, who said all kinds of terrible
[SPEAKER_01]: things about dispensaries in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of that process,
where these 24 average citizens got to
[SPEAKER_01]: really get into the trenches and study the
details of the initiative, we won.
[SPEAKER_01]: 13-11.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lesson for that is that we can
win, but it's going to be very close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what we're up against in
this race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're putting the best campaign
forward we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some good things going for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon has a voters' pamphlet that you can
buy pro and con arguments in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets mailed to every household.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an outstanding lineup in our
voters' pamphlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 11 arguments in, including one
from Tom Potter, the former mayor and
[SPEAKER_01]: police chief of Portland, Betty Roberts,
former justice of the Oregon Supreme
[SPEAKER_01]: Court, Christine Olson, former U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney for Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our goal was to have some law
enforcement people on our side,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think we did pretty good there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have eight other arguments from doctors
and patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other side has only two, one from
Citizens Against Legalizing Marijuana and
[SPEAKER_01]: another from the COPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we're going to win in that
arena that's going to be very influential.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope to raise a significant amount of
money over the next two months and use it
[SPEAKER_01]: to get out the vote on our side.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the one hand, and also to put out our
message that a regulated system will work
[SPEAKER_01]: better than what we have now and will make
sure all patients get the medicine they
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, wish us luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you can to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to win this election
in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
