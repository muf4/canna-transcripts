[SPEAKER_00]: Jody Emory, see that free Mark Emory,
see that banner up there that says free
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jody Emory, editor of Cannabis Culture
Magazine and British Columbia Green Party
[SPEAKER_00]: policing critic, is married to the Prince
of Pot Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Emory is a prominent activist and
philanthropist in Canada who funded the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana movement worldwide with millions
of dollars from his cannabis seed
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2005, the US Drug Enforcement
Administration had him arrested in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: After years of trying to fight
extradition, he was brought to Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a disgrace!
[SPEAKER_00]: He was brought to Seattle Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a five-year plea deal, prison term in
the United States, his wife Jody Emory
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to operate his store and website
and will run Canada's next federal
[SPEAKER_00]: election as a Green Party candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jody is devoted to her husband,
devoted to bringing Mark Emory back home,
[SPEAKER_00]: ending the war on drugs, so no one else
has to spend a single day in prison for
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: No prison for pot, Jody Emory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give her a welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: She came from Canada, speak to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Vivian and thank you to
everybody in Seattle, everybody at Seattle
[SPEAKER_01]: Henfest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been so good to my husband,
but it has also been so good to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: To look at this and know that I'm standing
in the United States of America,
[SPEAKER_01]: where millions of people are locked up and
arrested, their lives ruined because of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, that you're able to have this
here, where you can find out about where
[SPEAKER_01]: to buy marijuana seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And meanwhile, half an hour that way,
my husband sits in a prison cell,
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum security, awaiting sentencing for
selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't just selling seeds that got him
in trouble, because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Mark Emory, the Prince of Pot,
as he was known around the world through
[SPEAKER_01]: CNN, National Geographic, Rolling Stone,
everybody knew of Mark because he was the
[SPEAKER_01]: leader to many in the movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in 1994, he went to Vancouver and he
said, this movement needs money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our enemy has endless money, the
government, the police, the prisons,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got all the money and we need
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he decided to sell marijuana seeds and
said, every dollar I raise will go back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every dollar will go towards medical
marijuana initiatives, which he funded in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado and Arizona and Washington D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did federal class action lawsuits
against the government on behalf of
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sold millions of seeds all across
America through California and every state
[SPEAKER_01]: to help you grow your own marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to plant the seeds of freedom
and overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his mission was to enable people to be
free from this oppression, because a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people know about Mark, free Mark
Emory, Mark Emory, the Prince of Pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are thousands and thousands of
people who are in prison right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: who know about Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knows who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's calling for their name or hanging
a banner up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though it's horribly depressing to
be away from my loved one and to have him
[SPEAKER_01]: locked up here when he was facing life in
prison, to take a five year plea deal so
[SPEAKER_01]: his two co-accused didn't go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: To know that he has this much support
represents that all drug users and abusers
[SPEAKER_01]: and everybody who's suffering in the
United States prison industry is a victim
[SPEAKER_01]: of this war on drugs and it's got to end
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why he spent millions of dollars
and devoted all this time doing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: culture magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot TV was the first video streaming
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: He helped spread information.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ran in elections.
[SPEAKER_01]: He funded the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Millions and millions of dollars went
towards ending the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the DEA came into Canada in 2005
and had him arrested on conspiracy
[SPEAKER_01]: charges, they said he was going to go to
prison for 30 years to life but that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a significant blow to the marijuana
legalization movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that Mark Henry was targeted for
his legalization activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds weren't even mentioned in the press
release.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very clear that this U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: government and the DEA who's operating in
countries all over the world is going
[SPEAKER_01]: after the people who are fighting for
freedom because they don't care about the
[SPEAKER_01]: real drug dealers or the cartels or they
would be able to solve that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they care about is dissent and
calling for peace and tolerance and
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom and no more government oppression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while I go and visit my husband
tomorrow morning and I tell him about this
[SPEAKER_01]: enormous crowd and all of these people
here celebrating freedom which has been
[SPEAKER_01]: done so well by all the people behind
Seattle Hempfest who need your support,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be so pleased to know that if you
all just do something, spread the word
[SPEAKER_01]: free Mark Henry because it means free all
the prisoners of the drug war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we've got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on September 10th downtown here,
Mark is being sentenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you show up at the federal court,
show your support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the 18th, there's a worldwide
rally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had three worldwide rallies for
Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the 18th, if you just go and stand
on a street corner, hang a big sign off an
[SPEAKER_01]: overpass to say free Mark Henry or Google
Mark Henry and people will look him up and
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that this war on drugs is so
unjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the worst human rights abuses
that ever was and we've got to end it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's work together, get involved
politically like I do, donate to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hempfest because people like Mark aren't
around with money to give around to
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: They rely on your support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're here, donate $10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I donated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're enjoying this moment of freedom,
this beautiful day in this park in Seattle
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're in the United States of
America, one of the most oppressive
[SPEAKER_01]: countries on earth, but you have this
freedom and you keep fighting for it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll get more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you help me bring my husband
home to Canada, get him a prison transfer
[SPEAKER_01]: treaty, go to freemark.ca, cannabisculture
.com, look him up and help everybody in
[SPEAKER_01]: the drug war because when you free Mark
Henry, we free ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decent thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jody Emory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say free Mark Henry and you
give it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free Mark Henry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't hear you at the DEA office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free Mark Henry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free Mark Henry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free Mark Henry.
