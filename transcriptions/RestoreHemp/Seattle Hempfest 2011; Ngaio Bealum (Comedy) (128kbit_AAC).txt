[SPEAKER_01]: You like weed, do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make some noise, you like marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll roll a joint left-handed on a ski
lift wearing gloves and a blizzard at
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was in a gang, this would be my gang
sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who you roll with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll roll with everybody, dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a fight since 10th grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would I fight you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can negotiate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get it twisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll swell up to try to stop a fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see me in the parking lot later?
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo, shit, that was close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana has taught me a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made me a better cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't have any money,
but I smoke a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will invent shit to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we got Bisquick and peanut butter,
we got peanut butter rolls coming in 10 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked in the pantry one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had marshmallows, margarine,
and top ramen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making ramen treats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were hella good, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know y'all know what top ramen is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a room full of stoners, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you get a crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to break it down to a crowd one
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, y'all know a couple of
noodles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't afford a fucking cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to get old noodles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of you want to laugh harder,
but that second brownie just came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the challenge with the marijuana
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't always time it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't always time your drugs,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the only one here ever woken up
sweaty and confused on an airplane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you taking me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: People say to me, I do comedy a lot of
clubs around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, hey, you talk a lot about
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, shit, Eskimos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eskimos talk a lot about snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about what you know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Eskimos got 40 different words for snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's at least that many different words
for weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make up words.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you use the verb twist or roll,
you can say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, twist up a skiff-diffler.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting high as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, they're telepathic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just glad you guys all made it
outside, man, because I know you smoke a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to leave the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes three to five tries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to leave the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to leave the house.
