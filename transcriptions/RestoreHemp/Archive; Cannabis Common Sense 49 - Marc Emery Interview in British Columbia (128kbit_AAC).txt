[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Paul Stanford, and I'm one of
the chief petitioners on the Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here with me is my co-host,
my fellow chief petitioner, the treasurer
[SPEAKER_02]: of our political committee, the Campaign
for the Restoration and Regulation of
[SPEAKER_02]: Help, and the president of the Oregon
Wildlife Federation, Mr. Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked that introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, we are here to try and get you to
help us out with the Oregon Cannabis Tax
[SPEAKER_01]: Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Paul said, this show is part of our
political action committee, the Campaign
[SPEAKER_01]: for the Restoration and Regulation of
Help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's showing you there one of our
wonderful initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, on this show here,
we've got some special treats for you
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have some interviews up in
Vancouver, British Columbia, where we
[SPEAKER_01]: spent a few days up there checking out the
sea up in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had a good time up in
Vancouver, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went up there for, what, three days,
was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I had a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an excellent trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up in Vancouver, the police basically
ignore the marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't arrest people for smoking
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several establishments where
people openly smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we visited there and interviewed some
of the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tonight, we'll have Mark Emery on,
who is the founder and original proprietor
[SPEAKER_02]: of Hemp BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the viewers out there will
really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite educational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Emery is quite an inspiration to
everybody, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's definitely a unique individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got his own points of view,
which I'll agree with all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's got a vision, and he followed his
vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that fact that Mark Emery
had a vision, and he followed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's taken him incredible places.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been on CNN, featured on a number of
CNN things.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been on the cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the Wall Street Journal with his own
little picture there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just tons of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was nice enough to let us interview
him for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tonight, we'll show a portion of that
interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have some more on subsequent shows
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we'll have other interviews with
other folks up in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because up there in Vancouver,
they have the Cannabis Cafe, which sells
[SPEAKER_01]: food made from marijuana products,
all vegetarian, a lot of good vegan
[SPEAKER_01]: dishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the Hemp BC retail store.
[SPEAKER_01]: All sorts of products made from hemp
clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it has the smoking
utensils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has books on growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has just books on the plants,
the history of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interviews with the Cannabis Canada
magazine, which is one of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: magazines out there today on the whole
hemp issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interviews with some people,
like I say, who work for the magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some scenes of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Vancouver is a lovely city.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got to go up there and kind of
taste the cannabis culture, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're happy to take you there and
inform you of what's going on in our show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we go to our Bart Gimmery
interview, or at least part one of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to remind you to give us a call at
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're circulating the Oregon Cannabis Tax
Act petition, as many of you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have some of those petitions,
I want to urge you to fill in this box on
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom and mail them back to us right
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to get some more
signatures, do it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mail it back to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll mail you some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's get those petitions in.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will do
is tax and regulate the sales of marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: to adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will allow adults to cultivate
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will license farmers to cultivate the
crop for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will also allow medical marijuana and
the industrial cultivation of hemp to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce paper, fabric, protein,
oil, and literally 50,000 other products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to urge you to call us at
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely give us a call and help us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we want to change the entire
culture here in Oregon, that surrounding
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp, get rid of the prohibition culture,
and go into a much more of a regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the first step to freedom,
is to get rid of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to just regulate it,
the same as alcohol is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have it for recreational use in
state liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be, I think, a very good
way of doing it, because there's only
[SPEAKER_01]: adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: They check IDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you wouldn't have people on
playgrounds selling marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: people staying on the street corners
selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be much more of a pleasant
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the state, of course, would raise
money off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everybody would have a much
better time with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see up in Vancouver,
there's such a wonderful atmosphere up
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that comes through in the shows
that we have upcoming here, the various
[SPEAKER_01]: interviews, that the people up there just
really know how to respect the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, therefore, everybody's OK with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The police are OK with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's against the law there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the police say, hey, you know,
long as you don't bother anybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: why should we bother you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first part of this interview is
with Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to urge you to call us and get
these petitions, though, at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, once again, Mark Emory does say a few
radical things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we'll get into it this
portion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, he has his own views.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's really done a lot to change the
perceptions and misperceptions regarding
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana with some facts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without further ado, let's go to the
Mark Emory interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are in beautiful Vancouver,
British Columbia, and Canada interviewing
[SPEAKER_02]: the most famous marijuana smoker in the
world, the latest.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having us, Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Paul?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You originally were in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were an activist there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1980, I've been an activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was greatly inspired by Ayn
Rand and the book Atlas Shrugged and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Fountainhead in 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1979, I had become a real activist ever
since in issues of human freedom and
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing more pressing than marijuana
legalization in that front.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the first 12 years, from 1980 to
1992, I went to court and jail for many
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, opening my stores on
Sunday, which we were convicted of,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sent to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to sell everything that the
government banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to court and were convicted
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during a municipal garbage strike in
1986, I provided my own private garbage
[SPEAKER_00]: service for free for the public,
picked up 72,000 pounds of garbage,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to basically show people they
shouldn't be helpless during government
[SPEAKER_00]: strikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've done all sorts of stuff prior
to the marijuana legalization issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I really started in earnest in
around 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1991, was that when you moved here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that back in Ontario as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started selling illegal banned books on
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was shocked to find that they were
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always wondered why High Times was
never on the newsstands in Canada and why
[SPEAKER_00]: you couldn't buy any kind of material
about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because Canada has a law that
basically says anything that promotes,
[SPEAKER_00]: advocates, or in any way condones
marijuana use is illegal and subject to a
[SPEAKER_00]: $100,000 fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's on video or in printed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It specifically asks for marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it says any illegal drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't promote any illegal drug if
marijuana is illegal, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the primary one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's not a lot of people
promoting LSD or heroin, although there
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly is a lot of medical
documentation that would also be illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: in those areas too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, all books about the subject
are illegal, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are no exemptions, and it
provides for a $100,000 fine, and there
[SPEAKER_00]: were six months in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not a first offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second offense, $300,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, there isn't any fine bigger
than the criminal code, as it turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all for books about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, we started selling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't get charged for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was clearly unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up selling them in front of
the police station one day after a big
[SPEAKER_00]: press conference and hundreds of people
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still wouldn't arrest me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my history in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to Asia to live for a
couple of years, came back here in March
[SPEAKER_00]: of 94, and founded Hemp BC on April 11,
1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we really kicked up some dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that time, what was Hemp BC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of us don't know what Hemp
BC was at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came here, there were no hemp
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no pipes or bongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no books about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The High Times magazine was illegal in all
of Canada and not distributed here for
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five years by that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I knew there must be a market there
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did is, from April 11 through
July of that year, I sold High Times
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine in Grown and Stoned, door to
door, to houses, to people at bus stops,
[SPEAKER_00]: to variety stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a mini distributor to about 40,
50 stores who were willing to handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the way, four fifths of all people
approached in stores refused to handle
[SPEAKER_00]: High Times because it was banned,
they said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so human freedom and liberty is not
alive in the minds of most booksellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did find some who'd sell it,
like here and there, 5, 10, 20 copies and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I did for three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold things door to door and then earned
enough money to pay the rent on the
[SPEAKER_00]: location at 324 West Hastings,
which became the original Hemp BC and
[SPEAKER_00]: where we were first rated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, can I stop you here just for a
second?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you get the High Times from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we would just import them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't stop them at Customs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, based on a customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That law was not being enforced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fear factor involved in having a
law like that, meaning you could be
[SPEAKER_00]: charged at any time, meant that
conventional distributors simply wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the climate was also different in
the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Reagan Bush period, people were
easily scared off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that started to thaw considerably,
especially with the influence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: emperor wears no clothes in the late 80s
and early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually we did open on July 7th,
1994, the Hemp BC store, which is now the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp BC Legal Assistance Center at that
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that block was all boarded up
when you came to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a bad block.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact location of where Hemp BC was
founded used to be a communist Albanian
[SPEAKER_00]: bookshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had been put out of business when
somebody torched it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the place was all fired and charred
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was urine, smells, and urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just was a filthy block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the filthiest
buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was run by a guy who was anxious to
have anybody renovate the place and fix it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we got in a seemingly
controversial business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an Asian landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all my landlords are Asian for this
building, all our stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they tend to only care if they get
the rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really care about what you're
doing in that building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really do renovate all the
buildings extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the properties we've ever been in have
been improved considerably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've benefited by that trust in us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, though, we launched a
separate grow shop down the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after the first raid in January of
1996, we opened a little grow shop three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks later just next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we consolidated those into the
Hemp BC Superstore that you see now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the initial reaction of the
authorities when you opened up the first
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp BC store?
[SPEAKER_00]: We never got any reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never yet had a complaint sent to me
by letter form or written form from the
[SPEAKER_00]: city hall from anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I've never had a complaint from
the general public either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to work there six days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never had a single person say,
I don't agree with what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the least controversial enterprise
I've ever started.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've got to understand that
Vancouver and British Columbia are very
[SPEAKER_00]: much a live and let live society.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is they don't get politicians
that reflect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typical, because live and let
live people don't tend to go vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who tend to vote tend to be people
with property vested interests,
[SPEAKER_00]: people from Vancouver's west side who have
a lot of wealthy property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want anything to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want to keep a white
caucasian and that old Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people who want the new Vancouver are
the immigrants, the new people here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the movers and shakers, young people,
people who don't conventionally see any
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose to voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to a large degree, they're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no real purpose to voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is we're victimized by the
electoral process in the absence of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what do you see the future here in
Vancouver, the city, and the problems we
[SPEAKER_01]: see about democracy then, if this many
people are flouting the law and they won't
[SPEAKER_01]: change the laws?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is that going to have any sort of
impact on democracy here, you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ultimately, politicians are like a
flock of seagulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They follow the leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leader is public opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And public opinion, if it lingers long
enough in the one direction, will
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually permeate society completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all people will presume that that is
the proper way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are going to happen in a very
gradualist way without any momentous
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions on behalf of parliament or some
old judge who is not going to deliver
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we think we're due.
[SPEAKER_00]: Judges are very frightened old men,
really, who've been insulated behind a
[SPEAKER_00]: court bench for a lot of their lives and
don't really understand the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not used to shaking things up in
any proper, controversial way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially Canadian judges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian judges are particularly
conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to think they've got a heart of
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they do have a compassionate
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not the kind of people that
are courageous enough to change laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not going to find politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have 3 million pot smokers in
the country, about 15% of the adult
[SPEAKER_00]: population, perhaps even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have clearly no one in favor
of prohibition in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, you don't have a single
advocate for marijuana legalization in
[SPEAKER_00]: parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not one single guy has taken on
the issue of civil liberties for marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers, even though you'll find people in
parliament having the same interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: homosexuals, of whom there are far fewer
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see the same people having the
same interest in First Nations or Chinese
[SPEAKER_00]: or Asian people's rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those are legitimate,
but there's far fewer of each one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: groups in Canada than there are marijuana
smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason, we have been
considered suitable scapegoats,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they have in America, for 60 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no explanation ever offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in parliament, they never give an
explanation as to why we're keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody says, yes, we need to criminalize a
million Canadians and arrest 100,000 every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for what purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you never get that answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never get part two of the opening
premise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, OK, if we're having this police
state, what's the explanation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it goes like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's most incomprehensible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it great what's going on up there,
Paul, in Vancouver, British Columbia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's just fascinating what's going on
up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we can do better here by
getting our petition and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: signatures, get out of ballot this
November.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then come January 1, we could have
cannabis cafes here in Portland,
[SPEAKER_01]: all over Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need your help to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing these shows for a year
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have called us previously and got
our petitions, please send them right in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not sure where to send them to,
or you want more petitions, call us right
[SPEAKER_02]: away at 235-476-7000.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, we are actually paying
petitioners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you'd like to help us, give us a
call at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have access to the internet,
look at our web page at http://www.crrh
[SPEAKER_02]: .org.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually print our petitions
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want you to turn your petitions in,
though, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn them in so we can get a count out
there as soon as possible, because we know
[SPEAKER_01]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody kind of hangs on to them and
sort of forgets about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you only have two or three
signatures on there, send them in because
[SPEAKER_01]: they all count.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've sent thousands of those
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've just got a tiny fraction of them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we urge you to send your petitions back
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to have them by the end of June.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have petitions, send them back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you need more, give us a call at
503-235-7000.
[SPEAKER_02]: 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in the Portland area,
that's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we should get back to that Mark
Emory interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know that early history of
how Hemp BC started and how the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: culture there started and community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's going to be great watching
the rest of the interview and think about
[SPEAKER_01]: how we here in Oregon can do the same
thing with all of our help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it is, the Mark Emory Hemp BC
interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we're moving towards freedom,
then you're moving in a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly since the time I've been in
here, things have moved on the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: issue in a very positive direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, when you consider that
you couldn't buy a pipe in this town,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and you couldn't buy a book or
magazine about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, productivity has
probably tripled since I've been here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we've been on every major media,
which was unthinkable before, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: never think about putting a marijuana seed
dealer on the front page of the Wall
[SPEAKER_00]: Street Journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, CNN, the mass media,
the Ted Turner, you know, Time Warner,
[SPEAKER_00]: the corporate establishment give me a
great review on CNN, or for that matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rolling Stone, the old hippies and the new
capitalist in Rolling Stone give us an
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent review too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always get good reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a daily paper you've got article
from two days ago, another great full page
[SPEAKER_00]: article.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always great reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: The media is completely on side in a lot
of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they interview me, it comes out fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always ask them, whenever you do a grow
bust, you know, you always take these cops
[SPEAKER_00]: press releases and say, you know,
four hydroponic operations are seized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you ask them what their moral
justification for that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: If resources are short, how can you
justify changing out any marijuana growers
[SPEAKER_00]: when we know it's harmless, when everybody
in British Columbia approves of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: when two thirds have clearly gone on
record saying they don't think marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: should be illegal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you waste anybody's time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you destroy people's lives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you violate their civil rights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you continue this police state for
nothing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They never asked that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't get up the nerve to ask the
cops that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if every journalist asked the cop that
question every time there was a girl raid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd see them drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just wouldn't want to get grilled
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people who were raided would call
the press to alert them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the relationship would be reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd call them and say, I've just been
violated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these people would record their point
of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, it's repeatedly always the police
point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just print the police news bolt and
verbatim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they're a little more inquisitive
here because they know that most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: population is not supportive of this
marijuana war the police are waging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the media could do a lot
more to accelerate the liberation of
[SPEAKER_00]: several million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the reporters are on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, again, the older editorial staff,
the people who have more corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: interests in mind will like to tread a
fine line between supporting the police as
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody has to knee-jerk, do so in a
corporate, you know, democracy like we
[SPEAKER_00]: have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has to say, you know,
the police may have done something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we're against the police or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though, you know, they've been,
like, ruining lives and families in this
[SPEAKER_00]: unnecessary drug war for their own
self-interest, you know, for the last two
[SPEAKER_00]: decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sure, politicians inspire them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cops can tell them to fuck off,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got better things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one would say boo about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cops do it because a lot of people,
thousands of Canadians, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,000 cops are employed every eight-hour
shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just chase down marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they made marijuana illegal to more,
you've got 6,000 guys right there who are
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately superfluous and probably
10,000 or 20,000 other cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you didn't have a drug war at
all, you would need half the police
[SPEAKER_00]: officers in North America that you've got
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a fraction of the prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fraction of the prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd have a great increase in
society's safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, prohibition accomplishes the exact
opposite of every stated aim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It raises the price of marijuana or drugs
or all drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you and I, the consumer, have to spend
more of that on our supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to our children or education or
buying a new computer or a home or
[SPEAKER_00]: investing in the economy or starting your
own business, a lot of our money goes to
[SPEAKER_00]: the herbs and drugs we seek.
[SPEAKER_00]: It encourages police corruption,
armed crime gangs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It destabilizes at least 15 to 20 foreign
governments in the world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole countries are in total
destabilization because of a US drug war
[SPEAKER_00]: in South and Central America.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got whole aid programs geared on
whether they have a crop eradication
[SPEAKER_00]: program going on in that particular
community, like India or Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got organized crime profiting
because it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got biker gangs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got police corruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got people being shot dead in their
homes during raids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got every kind of civil liberty
disobedience from urine testing to kids
[SPEAKER_00]: riding on you at school to parents riding
on their kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a whole terrible system we've
fostered with this drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not a good thing has come of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's destroyed everything that's
supposedly held dear in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freedom, privacy, liberty, money,
law and order, clean government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition ruins it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the one that we really lost
in America, I don't know how you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: going here, but the right to be free from
search and seizure in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I was a kid growing up,
that was always held up to be one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that here in Canada,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cops do what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, they tend to be politer
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's friendly fascism, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I should talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the one hand, if I were in the
United States, I'd be in jail for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got 17 counts of guns,
including nine trafficking, and I'm still
[SPEAKER_00]: walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long that'll last,
but I'm still out on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they barred me from my own
businesses and forced me at gunpoint to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell them, the fact is all of it still
basically exists, except I'm not allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to own it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go on that block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can't go on that block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are revolutionary times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a revolution, you'd still be
allowed on the street and not a shot dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should be grateful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what kind of legal charges are you
facing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've got eight counts of
trafficking from two different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most recently, the one that got me
barred from my own stores, allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually I get charged, by the way,
after I do a major national interview of
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind, or we get raided or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was on the Vicki Gabaro show live
for 25 minutes nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on in the day, I was put in
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was charged for two counts of
trafficking, marijuana and hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently, two months earlier,
some Americans had come up to my cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: A man and his three daughters,
and I allegedly got them high,
[SPEAKER_00]: allegedly gave them a gift of $5 worth of
hash, which would be about that much,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a gram, a quarter of a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went back to the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got caught with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said Mark Emmer gave it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were let go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't really recall this
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, god, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could well just be a story.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, oh, Mark Emmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I find it fantastic that it's even,
you can use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what about the guy who's caught
with a big truck full of pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just say, hey, Mark Emmer told me
to deliver this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Clinton did, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or the mayor of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so they sent this back to
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sat on it for six, seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, right after that
interview, they charged me with two counts
[SPEAKER_00]: of trafficking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no witness, because they're
not coming back here to testify.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: No cop ever saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only person who took a statement
is an American immigration officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not even within the legal
jurisdiction of Canada that anything is
[SPEAKER_00]: alleged to have happened with anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, they charged me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't come to trial till next
December, so for the whole year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, they put me in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what led to you not being able
to visit this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put me in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, listen, if you don't agree
to never go back to the 300 block,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to sign this agreement
undertaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the failure to obey it is indefinite
imprisonment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're not letting you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to ask them to hold you in,
because you've already got tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: trafficking charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had to agree with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would never let me out for months and
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, if I'm going to the block where my
old shops are, then I would go to jail
[SPEAKER_00]: indefinitely until it comes up to trial in
December.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that great what's going on up there
in Vancouver?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, I'll have to say it's
fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Mark Ember, he's such a great
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's fascinating how he stood up for
all of our rights up there and pioneering
[SPEAKER_02]: things with direct civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, from what he started off with,
just like selling banned books and banned
[SPEAKER_01]: magazines to saying, OK, we're going to
sell smoking utensils.
[SPEAKER_02]: To a multimillion dollar enterprise with
43 employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just pulled himself up by his
bootstraps, basically going door to door
[SPEAKER_02]: selling magazines and using that to open
his businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, that's kind of interesting
going from shop to shop saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, here's, you know, do you want to take
a couple of copies?
[SPEAKER_02]: This banned magazine that can get you
busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was quite impressive how he did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I say, I mean, the man, he had a
vision and he followed it and he got
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, we here have a
vision in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is to completely legalize and
regulate adult sales of marijuana to allow
[SPEAKER_02]: people to grow their own, to license
farmers to grow the crop commercially,
[SPEAKER_02]: to allow medical patients to access
marijuana through pharmacies with a
[SPEAKER_02]: doctor's prescription and to allow farmers
without a license to cultivate industrial
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp to produce thousands of different
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can do that here in Oregon with
your help.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us 503-235-235-4606 and give us a
call today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, help us put into reality
our vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Mark Emory, like I say,
had his vision up there in Vancouver for
[SPEAKER_01]: all of British Columbia and for eventually
all of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wants to have it for all of North
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's quoted in a Rolling Stone
interview, the one that has a Buffy the
[SPEAKER_01]: Vampire Slayer on a cover if folks want to
go out and look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great interview with Mark in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's saying that, you know,
he wants to spread his vision elsewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: and he doesn't mind who else copies it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, he said that and it was picked up
in the Portland magazine, the Willamette
[SPEAKER_02]: Week, that Portland is going to be one of
the next places to follow that example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to go farther than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to regulate the market and just
end prohibition here and now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So help us with the Oregon Cannabis Tax
Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call us at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have our petitions, send them back
in now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll send you out some more, but we have
to have all of our signatures by the end
[SPEAKER_02]: of June.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't delay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send them back today or call us right now
and we'll send you the petitions in a
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So call us right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, give us a call,
you know, and talk to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're feeling alone out there that,
you know, there's nobody else out there
[SPEAKER_01]: like that that's going to, like you,
that likes to see it regulated,
[SPEAKER_01]: likes to see patients be able to get this
with a doctor's prescription for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: the doctor thinks it should be needed for,
you know, call us and talk to folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: are just like you, who want to see this
regulated, who want to see an end to
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition, who want to see an end to
crime, who want to see an end to the war
[SPEAKER_01]: on some drugs, who want to see a beginning
of freedom to bring back our liberties,
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring back the fund that marijuana can
give you, any kind of recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: pursuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to stop this incredible buildup of
prisons and the prison industrial complex
[SPEAKER_02]: in the United States, if you want to help
restore freedom in America, help us with
[SPEAKER_02]: the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act by calling us
at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely give us a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I say, I mean, I just,
you know, it's to ban a plant is just so
[SPEAKER_01]: ludicrous to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, something that grows, it shouldn't
be banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just like who, you know,
we think we're more powerful than nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're more powerful than a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just like a plant grows
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just like, this is a downfall
of our society when we try to ban things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: So call us at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in closing, I would like to tell you
that I am a candidate in the Democratic
[SPEAKER_02]: primary that's coming up on May 19th.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm running for state representative.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are six different candidates in the
race for House District 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's inner Southeast and Northeast
Portland.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you live between Holgate and the
Banfield Freeway from Southeast 50th down,
[SPEAKER_02]: vote for me in the May 19th Democratic
primary here in inner Southeast and
[SPEAKER_02]: Northeast Portland.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Stanford for state rep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call us, get our petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call us at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.
Good night.
