[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Marvin Rebulb and I represent
congressional district number four,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Lane County, the central part of
the state, Congressman DeFazio's area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about what's going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want a commercial brokerage or
insurance brokerage or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have offices in Portland and Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to see a lot of businesses,
small businesses, large businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happen to believe that this could be our
Napa Valley, our Silicon Valley,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are committed to doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the rest of the country is
looking at Oregon right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been some mistakes that have
been made in the other two states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to avoid those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start making rules later on
this year with the idea that this becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: an economic engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the goals that I have is that
in the coming year, this next biennium,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Liquor Control is going to deliver
to the state of Oregon $1.2 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what liquor, wine, and beer does to
the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we don't have a consumption tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to be as excited to one day
say, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry produced $1.2
billion to the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we can build a library once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
