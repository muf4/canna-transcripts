[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Gunn who said, first they
ignore you, then they laugh at you,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they fight you, then you win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like we're past the laughter
stage and people are starting to take
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis a little more seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see a lot of documentaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, the slant, because they
are going to fight it, the slant has kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of changed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be a little way more
open-minded in the first couple of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the last one they just had on front
line I thought was tilted a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the DEA, who was clearly lying,
than toward an even balanced or even more
[SPEAKER_00]: pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis and ginger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the challenge to create
the good content for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I think, you know, even not just
national programming, but like local
[SPEAKER_00]: programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do a show called Cannabis Planet
and it came on in Los Angeles and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, I was shocked at the amount of
response that I got from people that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't even have thought were pot
cannabis users or just people who watch
[SPEAKER_00]: television.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, I'll go watch that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's things like that you can do to
spread the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put together your own cable access
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice.
