[SPEAKER_01]: Captain and I have always hoped to have an
army of petitioners of a thousand or
[SPEAKER_01]: fifteen hundred people that one day are
trained from day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freedom fighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freedom fighters and reefer raiders,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ronald Reagan said reefer people could
never make the ballot that our minds are
[SPEAKER_01]: too slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ronnie, my mind's not too slow and I
don't have to read my lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you think you're going to succeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody can beat the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can anybody beat the truth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: No way, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This man and I have been out there telling
the truth and nobody's ever said we're
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep arresting us 33 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have beaten us in jails.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have done physical things to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to describe on this air,
but there's nothing that can beat a fact
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's no and I don't care how
popular a president thinks he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people realize that he's killed off a
planet and he's killed off the knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: of a planet and he's allowed millions of
people to die prematurely and in pain and
[SPEAKER_01]: in misery and has ruined the quality of
life that could be gotten with a good
[SPEAKER_01]: simple medicine that never killed anybody
except that the hands of bad public policy
[SPEAKER_01]: and police carrying out bad public policy
with a vengeance.
