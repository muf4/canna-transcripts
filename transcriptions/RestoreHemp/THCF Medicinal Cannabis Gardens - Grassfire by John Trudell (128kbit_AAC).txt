In
[SPEAKER_01]: between the blues There are good days and
bad days With everything and nothing to
[SPEAKER_01]: lose While the setting sun never sits And
the night has no limits The void between
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom and free Dealing with the
unnatural reality A need to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: a need to be Grassfire, my DNA needs THC
Grassfire, in a world that yearns That's
[SPEAKER_00]: the way this fire burns Like a grassfire
[SPEAKER_01]: In the unnatural society Been trying to
maintain While the same appear to be
[SPEAKER_01]: clearly insane With no way to explain
Outlasting the great lie A sparking spark
[SPEAKER_01]: does my mind Grassfire Pulling the sky
Breathing in Sativa's design
[SPEAKER_00]: Grassfire, in a world that yearns That's
the way this fire burns
[SPEAKER_01]: The void between freedom and free Dealing
with the unnatural reality A need to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: a need to be Grassfire, my DNA needs THC
[SPEAKER_01]: Dreaming of long times past All that those
times brought Looking to the heart of
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow Grassfire, in a world that yearns
That's the way this fire burns
That's the way this fire burns
That's the way this fire burns
