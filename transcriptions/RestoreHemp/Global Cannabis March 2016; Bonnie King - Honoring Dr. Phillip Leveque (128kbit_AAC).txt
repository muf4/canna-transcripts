[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the biggest event the whole
month of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, May is marijuana month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard that medical marijuana
month, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the biggest and most impressive
reasons that we're here today all comes
[SPEAKER_00]: together in this one gentleman down here
in the center picture, Dr. Phil Levesque.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people have done a lot of
things for medical marijuana, but very few
[SPEAKER_00]: have done what Dr. Levesque has done for
the state of Oregon and for the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole globe, believe me, because he
was not just a spokesman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a doctor that believed in us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He believed in patients' rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: He believed in ending pain, ending the
disability, to reach what you need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the medicine that you really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he saw from a young age that cannabis
was that medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was born in 1923.
[SPEAKER_00]: His dad was one of the great loggers of
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when his sons were young, he told Dr.
Levesque and his brother, don't go into
[SPEAKER_00]: logging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to find a new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was in the 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to college, and he got his degree
in biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He joined Patton's Army thinking that he'd
be able to help in some fantastic level
[SPEAKER_00]: because of his chemistry degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, they said, hey, dude,
you're missing a couple of fingers on your
[SPEAKER_00]: right hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be an officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead, he joined the infantry and
became a scout, and is one of the scouts
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually lived from Patton's Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed the Rhine.
[SPEAKER_00]: His stories go on forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, this is his book,
Dog Face Soldier, Doc Levesque's own book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being re-edited right now,
but there are a few copies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wrote his memoirs of the war.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he came back from the war,
he went to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got his degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that he trained under knew all
about cannabis medicine because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: the old guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd been using cannabis medicine
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never even questioned whether or not
they should use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he discovered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still, he would say right now,
should he be here?
[SPEAKER_00]: That there's a bottle of cannabis medicine
somewhere in his barn from back then
[SPEAKER_00]: because it worked so well he decided to
keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was born in the wool, died in the
wool, cannabis crusader from a young age.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a lifetime of incredible
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the first doctor to teach surgeons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brain surgery in Sierra Leone in their
brand new hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he made a lot of really great dedicated
moves for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it came to cannabis, he came back
to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He set up practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he soon discovered where his real
calling was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put his all into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got together with Paul Stanford,
Paul Loney, and a lot of other very
[SPEAKER_00]: important folks, and worked at the TMC.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCF clinic, the very first clinic in the
state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he helped veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had over 1,000 veterans were his
clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they were near and dear to his
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of us were.
[SPEAKER_00]: He testified over 400 times as a
toxicologist, pharmacologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a PhD in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the only toxicologists in the
country with those credentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were lucky enough in the state of
Oregon to be able to have him be with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Represent us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speak to our legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to our hearings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is one of the greatest assets to
the medical marijuana program worldwide
[SPEAKER_00]: that's ever existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it seems almost fitting that last
year on Global Cannabis Day, he left us
[SPEAKER_00]: and passed on to New Horizons,
a better journey, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I am so honored to be able to be
the one that says, we dedicate this stage
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, Global Cannabis Day,
Global Cannabis March, here in Portland,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stage is dedicated to Dr. Phil
Levesque.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now the Dr. Phil Levesque Memorial
Stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being here is really what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single one of you is absolutely
important and precious to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from Doc, what does Doc have to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
Don't smoke in the rain.
