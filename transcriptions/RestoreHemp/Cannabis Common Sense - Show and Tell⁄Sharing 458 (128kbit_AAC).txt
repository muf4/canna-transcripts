[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a little show-and-tell
now, as we often do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little sharing, as they call it these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought this on last week, but I just
liked it so much, I thought I'd bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: How close can you come in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Johnson & Johnson.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Closer still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, Johnson & Johnson, cannabis,
indica, and salicylic acid, aspirin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was used for psoriasis, or warts,
or corns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a very valuable aid for a wide
assortment of skin diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Johnson & Johnson's a trusted name
that we let our, I think my kids still use
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnson baby shampoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we used the baby oil in earlier
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next door to it, this is from
England, and from Boots Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boots Pharmacy's are big in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are corn strap rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aspirin again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says apply this to your corns,
and leave it on there overnight,
[SPEAKER_00]: then put a little warm water on,
and your corn will come right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a nifty thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next door, Dr. Bronner's Pure Castile Hemp
Peppermint Soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a refill bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this at home, and I'm about halfway
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've refilled my smaller bottles with this
big jumbo bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next door, we have Hemp Hulled Hemp Nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: These taste like cashews and walnuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a very rich, nutty, nutritious
food that's high in the essential fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: acids, omega-3, 6, and 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to it, we have Hemp Flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hemp seed that's had the oil
pressed out, and left over is high protein
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp flour to make hemp burgers or hemp
protein shakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to it, now I take about seven
of these, or eight of them every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cold pressed hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here it is next door in a big bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't eat it raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it better in the capsules myself,
so I take it in the capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can use it in salads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it in all kinds of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time you're using olive oil or
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, distributed right
here in Portland by Living Harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Living Harvest Chocolate Hemp
Milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in vanilla and unflavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get hemp milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more nutritious than soy milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the end of our show and tell
for this evening.
