[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Mary Haddock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the chair of the Oregon chapter for
Parents for Pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents for Pot's mission is to end
prohibition one family at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also focus on eliminating any of the
stigma surrounding people and parents that
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to use cannabis as medicine for
themselves or for their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself do not use cannabis, but I am the
mother and the wife of two patients in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the part of the family that supports
the patients that I live with and that are
[SPEAKER_00]: part of my family every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely know the difference that
cannabis has made in my life and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lives of my family members.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a dispensary worker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work at a dispensary in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you the effects that have
occurred since they've changed the Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean Air Act and that my coworkers cannot
medicate when they're on the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that the effects that I
have to watch one of my coworkers
[SPEAKER_00]: physically sit down for more than half of
her shift because she's in so much pain
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're so busy that she cannot take a
10-minute break and leave her station to
[SPEAKER_00]: go and medicate because she can no longer
medicate at her workplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stand here today not as a cannabis user
but also as a parent who watched her child
[SPEAKER_00]: go through major depression issues and
other issues in her life that cannabis was
[SPEAKER_00]: the only thing that kept her off of 14
different medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stand here before you not only,
sorry, stand here before you not only as a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother and a wife, but as a person that
will fight for her community and the
[SPEAKER_00]: unjust way that Oregon has switched
everything that we voted for in Measure
[SPEAKER_00]: 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will stand here with the nine
members of the Board of Parents for Pot in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland and also our brand new branch in
Southern Oregon to fight for every single
[SPEAKER_00]: person in this state to have the right to
choose their medicine the way they use it
[SPEAKER_00]: and to be able to go with the people that
they associate with and to be in places
[SPEAKER_00]: where they can consume their medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
