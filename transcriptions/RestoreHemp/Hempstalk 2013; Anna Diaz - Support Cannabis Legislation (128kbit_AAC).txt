[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Anna Diaz, and I am from the
Normal Women's Alliance, and I'm also one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the founders of Oregon Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to talk to you today about
legalization, because it's time has come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got some really great news from the
DOJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like maybe they're going to
honor states' rights to legalization in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in Oregon, the legislature is
already talking about creating a law there
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than letting it go through the
initiative process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, the powers that be are
starting to understand that legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that the people want and
something that the people are requiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad news is our people are still
getting busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just this summer, my good friend Lori from
Southern Oregon got rated for providing
[SPEAKER_00]: safe access to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just this last week, 14 private residents
in Oregon, right here in Portland,
[SPEAKER_00]: got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard all the details yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody left me a note that said,
well, maybe they should have gotten busted
[SPEAKER_00]: for shipping 50 pounds of weed to Texas
and New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first thought was, don't people in
Texas and New York need weed too?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for Prohibition to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is time for everybody out here
that's having a good time to step up and
[SPEAKER_00]: contact your local representatives and
your federal representatives and tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: to stop sending us to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop taking our babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop destroying our families and allow us
to consume cannabis in peace like we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing right here, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys are the ones who can make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had some kind of impact on this
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If every one of you stepped up,
you could do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not anybody special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a person who's pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not pissed off about what's
happening with cannabis in our community
[SPEAKER_00]: today, then you're not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even though we are so fortunate
that we can be out here enjoying the
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom of weed right here, right now,
our people are still getting busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our people are still going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's mostly people of color and people
who are younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kids who think it's really cool to
sell weed so you can pay your rent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to help us legalize too because
you can get a real job in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a 40-hour work week and get
paid to do that same thing if we legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can grow industrial hemp in this
state, the jobs that will be created and
[SPEAKER_00]: the sustainability that it will provide
for us is infinitely large.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even put it into words.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was unemployed for two years trying to
find a job here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had jobs through industrial hemp and
the cannabis businesses that can be built
[SPEAKER_00]: once we legalize, I probably could have
had a job the first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I ask you all, as you're out here
enjoying yourselves, when you go home,
[SPEAKER_00]: think about what a good time you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how great it felt to be free
because doesn't it feel great to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: free?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't it feel great to be free?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call those representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them a postcard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive them crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them know that they know who you are
and that you support cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't vote for anybody that doesn't
support cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're from Washington, there's a
petition here you can sign today that
[SPEAKER_00]: promotes real legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Anna Diaz, and I am a proud
Stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me at the marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
