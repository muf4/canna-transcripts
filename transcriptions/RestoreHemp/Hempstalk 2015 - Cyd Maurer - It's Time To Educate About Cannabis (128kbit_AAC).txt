[SPEAKER_00]: As you just heard, my name is Syd Mauer
and I am a former local news anchor from
[SPEAKER_00]: Eugene, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still really new for me to be talking
about this and standing on a stage talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis, something that I of
course, like many of you, have worked on
[SPEAKER_00]: hiding for many years before this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened to me was I was forced to
take a drug test and was fired due to
[SPEAKER_00]: inactive THC metabolites in my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you out there probably understand
that when you consume cannabis it
[SPEAKER_00]: interacts with your body differently than
almost anything else and traces of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: even when inactive, stay in your system
for up to 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though I was completely 100% sober
at work, I was penalized and fired for
[SPEAKER_00]: personal cannabis use in my own time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's more is my news director,
an assistant news director, my immediate
[SPEAKER_00]: bosses fought for me to keep my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in case anyone out there was wondering
if it was something else going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told virtually verbatim that it was
my drug test that came back positive for
[SPEAKER_00]: THC metabolites that led to my firing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of just being quiet about it
and kind of pretending like that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, trying to maybe go back into the
news or back into the corporate world,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so frustrated, so frustrated that I
had to speak out against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was completely legal for an out of
state attorney, corporate attorney to fire
[SPEAKER_00]: me, but it wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal, but not right and that is why I'm
speaking out against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little more backstory on my
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like many news stations out there,
my station was very, very comfortable with
[SPEAKER_00]: drug testing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not exaggerating with saying that I
had a coworker who tripped and was drug
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a coworker who bumped her head and
was drug tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for my situation, I was in rush hour
traffic and I tapped the bumper of the car
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of me and was forced to take a
drug test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though I left two scratches on a
bumper in front of me was completely sober
[SPEAKER_00]: and that wouldn't have led to me getting
fired because I used cannabis in my
[SPEAKER_00]: personal time, I was fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, this is completely legal
and I truly believe that the only way that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna see any change, any movement
in these unfair policies is if we continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to educate and expose people to the truth
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this policy was in place to keep people
safer, it's failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to believe that someone
who uses cannabis in their free time is at
[SPEAKER_00]: all unsafe or less safe than someone who
say consumes alcohol in their free time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a minute to think about my
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had I used alcohol or had I used even a
harder substance like meth or cocaine days
[SPEAKER_00]: before my accident, I would still have my
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it was cannabis and like I
said, it stays in your system for longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to explain to businesses that this
is bad business practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not keeping anyone safer and it's
actually sending a really negative message
[SPEAKER_00]: to employees, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The top employers like Microsoft,
for instance, they don't drug test because
[SPEAKER_00]: they respect their current or prospective
employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many reasons that drug
testing is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, policemen aren't drug tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the FBI, for instance,
has stopped drug testing certain
[SPEAKER_00]: departments because they weren't getting
the application turnout that they needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is known that using cannabis in your
free time does not increase your risk as a
[SPEAKER_00]: worker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, this policy should not be in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a reactionary thing,
if there was a time in history where we
[SPEAKER_00]: can point that cannabis was legal and a
bunch of people were just coming to work,
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned and causing, you know, just
terrible, dangerous accidents all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the new story that I was in
the news business for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And never once was there some crazy
incident about someone coming to work and
[SPEAKER_00]: causing accidents because they were stoned
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This instance or this policy was put in
place because Ronald Reagan decided that
[SPEAKER_00]: he wanted to make a federal drug-free
workplace policy, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, it spread and we are
where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I mentioned, I am speaking out to
educate people and expose people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly believe some people really just
don't understand cannabis and that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: they're against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's anything that I could
explain to you is talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come out of the cannabis closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't talk about your cannabis use,
how is anyone supposed to understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't make you a bad person?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make you more dangerous,
more lazy, or any worse than someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: chooses to use alcohol or any other
substance in their free time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to find out more about
me, it's Sid Maurer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at me on Twitter and Facebook
and I'm blogging for Marijuana Politics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a great website if you're looking
to follow anything and everything on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again for listening to me.
