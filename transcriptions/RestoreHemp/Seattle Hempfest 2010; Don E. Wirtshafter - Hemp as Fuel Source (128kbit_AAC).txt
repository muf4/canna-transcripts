[SPEAKER_00]: In the 90s, we were making hemp oil in
Ohio with Chinese seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got pretty popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started taking the seed cake,
the waste product, and making hempenil out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that got so popular that we were
producing oil 24-7 around the clock,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I ended up with 6,000 extra barrels,
6,000 extra gallons of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were making it for the seed
cake at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that became the oil that powered the
hemp car coming out here 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you recall at Hempfest, we had one of
the first biodiesel powered cars was here,
[SPEAKER_00]: running on hemp fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We powered Woody Halston's bus down the
West Coast in the Further movie,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting here in Seattle and going down
the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them riding the bicycles,
but with the bus following them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we proved a long time ago that we
can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran the generators here on biodiesel
one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely convertible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more energy in the hemp
plant than just the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually a man here named
Aguadas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's here at Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got a patent for pyrolytization
in a new way that is very promising for
[SPEAKER_00]: turning much more of the hemp plant into
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of discourage hemp for energy
because it's so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you take $40 a gallon of oil and
burn it up in your car?
[SPEAKER_00]: But pyrolytization gives us the
opportunity to actually create fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: economically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
