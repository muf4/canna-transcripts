[SPEAKER_00]: Think about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I think that the medical marijuana
movement will get a lot further if they
[SPEAKER_00]: will reach out and help explain the
realities of hemp, the larger issue of
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, hemp helps everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp helps the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see enough awareness being
given to hemp as hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're too busy using the medical marijuana
for our own enjoyment and to help heal the
[SPEAKER_00]: pain and these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're ignoring hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp will help the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practical reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to talk about medicine,
all right, we're talking about medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana as medicine for the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hemp is medicine for the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we forget the earth, then we're
only going halfway there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's just some attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build your home out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your clothes out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp, the CBD is in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They serve a larger medicinal purpose for
the human body than even the THC does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people need to kind of look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're talking about diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very effective against breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about a real deal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody's paying any attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the attention is being put to the THC
aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's time to recognize the
entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
