[SPEAKER_00]: When you picture a cannabis consumer,
who is it that comes to mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that that image that used to be one
of lazy, stoner, stupid, hungry,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the awful stereotypes that are
absolutely not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that that image of who a cannabis
consumer for you has changed because I
[SPEAKER_00]: know for me it certainly has.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in fact more motivated than nearly
anybody on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading an article yesterday saying
that people who consume cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: exercise, exercise for longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we're really finding some cool
trends and the stigmas are being shattered
[SPEAKER_00]: about who cannabis consumers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me as a mother, as a woman,
as a business owner, as someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteers with non-profits and advocates
for education choices and all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legalization things, particularly
social consumption, which is the topic
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm particularly interested in as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I implore all of you to support the social
consumption movement going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a place to sign up over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know for me, as a woman in this
world right now, I want to scream from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rooftops that I am a cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't look like the typical cannabis
consumer, although today I may in my
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis dress, which I wear proudly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other areas of my life,
I don't look like a cannabis consumer and
[SPEAKER_00]: I go out of my way to tell everybody that
I am because I think it's up to each of us
[SPEAKER_00]: right now to go out into the world and
say, this is my medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know so many other people that are
finding healing relief from cannabis as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My teenage self would have never believed
what I would do when I grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pinch myself nearly every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Samantha Montanaro and I'm the
co-founder of Tokitivity, the global
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community for women.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have women's communities that organize
events in the United States, South Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain and Canada, and soon 135 other
cities around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I have learned from this
women's community is the ultimate love
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis brings to the surface and
how cannabis can be a vehicle for us being
[SPEAKER_00]: our best selves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women, when they get together and consume
cannabis together, there is this swirling
[SPEAKER_00]: magical energy that is really truly
magical and I think we all, regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: gender, feel that when we consume
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is such a beautiful plant and it is my
life's work from now until forever to
[SPEAKER_00]: advocate for the walls coming down around
cannabis for equal access and really for
[SPEAKER_00]: global legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an opportunity right now to be
pioneers, each and every one of you,
[SPEAKER_00]: by just going out into the world and
saying, I'm a cannabis consumer or by
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing on your Facebook that,
hey, this is a place where you can sign a
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or by going into your dispensary if you're
not a cannabis consumer and going in and
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to learn about what this plant
has to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have an opportunity to be a true
pioneer in this space right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more than enough room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a long ways to go until
everybody's out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much work to do and we need
every single person on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really implore you to join me and so
many others here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find out more about what we do at
Tokitivity.com and again, my name is
[SPEAKER_00]: Samantha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much to all of the absolute
legends whom I have adored and been
[SPEAKER_00]: humbled by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your advocacy and your leadership has made
me a leader and I will continue to take my
[SPEAKER_00]: leadership and turn other people into
leaders as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for everything and what
an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
