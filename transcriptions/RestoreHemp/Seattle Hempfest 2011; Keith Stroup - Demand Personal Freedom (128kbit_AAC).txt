[SPEAKER_00]: Keith Straub, my good friend, the founder
of the National Organization for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Foreign Marijuana Laws, NORMAL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up!
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Vivian and the HIPFAST.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a wonderful celebration of personal
freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start off by being honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke pot and I like it a lot,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first smoked marijuana in 1965 when I
was a freshman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been a regular marijuana smoker
ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here to say there's absolutely
nothing wrong with the responsible use of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana by adults, regardless of why you
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be none of the government's
business whether we smoke or why we smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: NORMAL is the marijuana smoker's lobby in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been now for four decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: We founded the organization in 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: We favor the elimination of all penalties
for the responsible use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also favor the establishment of a
legally regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you good folks here in Washington are
going to have a chance to vote on an
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative like that in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may well be the first state to
actually fully legalize marijuana in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make it happen!
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also favor personal cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is that consumers should have the
right to grow their own marijuana so that
[SPEAKER_00]: if the industry tries to charge us too
much, or if the marijuana isn't good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, or if it's not convenient,
screw them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will grow our own just like we do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what is important, I think,
is that for those of us who smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana to get up, stand up,
light up, and let the world know how we
[SPEAKER_00]: feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must come out of the closet and demand
our rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do that for a number of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we have to overcome a negative
stereotype that many older Americans still
[SPEAKER_00]: have about marijuana smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to demonstrate that marijuana
smokers are just average Americans who
[SPEAKER_00]: work hard, who raise families,
and who pay taxes, and who contribute in a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive way to their communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not criminals and we should not be
treated like criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as gays and lesbians demonstrated
over the last two or three decades,
[SPEAKER_00]: they won their rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won their rights in this country
largely by the courageous ability and
[SPEAKER_00]: willingness of a lot of people to come out
of the closet, to overcome a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: stereotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, smokers have to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, there's nothing wrong with
smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to be identified as a pot
smoker and, in fact, get involved
[SPEAKER_00]: politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't vote for a candidate from public
office who wants to treat you like a
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 30 million Americans smoked pot just
in the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we would simply take that pledge to
stop voting for people that wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat us like criminals, we will change
these laws in the next couple of election
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, very briefly, prohibition is a failed
public policy for two or three basic
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is we waste $10 billion a year chasing
and arresting and prosecuting marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We arrest 850,000 people a year in this
country for marijuana offenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another marijuana smokers arrested every
38 seconds in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've arrested 20 million marijuana
smokers just since 1965.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for Christ's sake, just for that
reason, let's move it aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is even a conceptual reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most Americans agree the government has no
business coming into our house to know
[SPEAKER_00]: what books we read, to know what music we
listen to, or how we conduct ourselves in
[SPEAKER_00]: the privacy of the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, neither do they have any business
coming into our house to know whether we
[SPEAKER_00]: drink alcohol or smoke marijuana when we
relax in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is simply none of their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does that leave us?
[SPEAKER_00]: You folks are on the verge of changing
policy that's been in place for 75 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either Colorado, California, Washington,
Oregon, or Massachusetts, almost certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those states, maybe more,
are going to fully legalize marijuana in
[SPEAKER_00]: November of 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: You people have an excellent chance to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will change the world if you help us
accomplish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, it is important to keep in
mind we're only incidentally talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really talking about personal
freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get up, light up, support normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's restore a measure of personal
freedom to the lives of tens of millions
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith Straub from Normal, the founder of
the National Interest Station for the Four
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Laws.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
