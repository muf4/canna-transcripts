[SPEAKER_00]: Wild seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeding life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the earth is our mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the land is her flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the water is her milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the oil is her blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are her children.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this land we come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of this earth we're made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: With us as future ancestors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given response, abilities to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the future we bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't take care of the land,
how can the land take care of us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with sky and air we breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is time to remember tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality of we reap what we sow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality of land and life is in the
seed.

[SPEAKER_00]: Memory of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild seed memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping alive alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up close, face to face with the destroyer
and their synthetic seed without memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toxic planting poison in earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disregarding well-being for maximizing
profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abandoning the children to massive debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making the price of freedom unaffordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the expense of the many.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the benefit of the few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a spreading mad human disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chaos in minds with liar's promises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeding old fears with new fears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life in the world of the money man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to think our way out of what we
believed our way into.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we show respect to life if we
don't use our common sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Life seeding life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the earth is our mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the land is her flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the water is her milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the oil is her blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are her children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the land is her mother.
