[SPEAKER_01]: As a consumer, you have the right to know
how your medicine is grown, what's in your
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to, folks, ask that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't grow your own medicine,
ask your grower what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a consumer, you have the right to know
it's your medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stand up for it and ask, what's going
on with my medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, normal, we're out there lobbying
to improve our laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now, the dispensaries are
starting to be rolled out, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations to everybody who got their
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, you know, folks, we need to have
it so that if a school moves in next to
[SPEAKER_01]: the dispensary, the dispensary has to
close.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not fair, is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're there paying your taxes,
paying your employees, doing everything
[SPEAKER_01]: you're supposed to do, and then a school
moves in, you have to close, that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: America, folks, and one of my clients told
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds more like Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, that part has to be fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to your legislatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as Scott said, we're voting in
November.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these legislators literally coming
around asking for your vote and state here
[SPEAKER_01]: and ask them, you know, what are you going
to do to improve my access to medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to fix this law?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are you going to stop these
moratoriums?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, again, because they're going to
be back next year, folks, asking for
[SPEAKER_01]: another moratorium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't let that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them it's time to stop being scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to come up with reasonable
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody here supports reasonable
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all we're asking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one is why do we have a
dispensary have to be a thousand feet from
[SPEAKER_01]: another one?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, bars could be next to each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's not, you know,
why dispensaries have to be a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: feet from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that just artificially increases
the price of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and once again, that's not
America, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, talk to your state
legislatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, why are they doing this to us?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we need to make sure that free
competition can take place, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that our growers can be protected as
they grow medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to worry about artificial
weight limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to your state legislatures about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, educate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the state legislatures aren't very
educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard Congressman Earl Blumenauer talk
about him, how he got educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's time we have to educate the rest
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't leave it up to Congressman Earl
Blumenauer to educate folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our responsibility is to get out
there and educate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Anna's doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Patients for Pod, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normal Women's Alliance, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's IKO out there making
videos of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and so, you know, and part of
my other life, as I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: represent processors and growers and
producers and dispensaries, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: represent folks who get into trouble out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always like to wrap up my little
talk with, if you ever get stopped by the
[SPEAKER_01]: police, when they approach you,
what you have to say, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, you know, don't say nothing,
because he's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't say anything, but there's four
little sayings that you always have to
[SPEAKER_01]: think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say them and repeat after me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And IKO knows these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russ knows them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russ used them quite well the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one is, am I free to go,
officer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not consent to anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish to speak to my attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish to speak to my attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thanks, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real message right there, folks,
is we don't have to be bullied by the
[SPEAKER_00]: police when you're pulled over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you know your rights and how
to handle the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we read up on it, study up on it,
put ourselves in those situations,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can be protected.
