[SPEAKER_00]: We've been on the front line for
struggling for freedom of the plant and of
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumers of cannabis since maybe like
17 years now and it was nothing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of built everything from zero with
no money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually what we did and I want to
just give a brief little update about
[SPEAKER_00]: what's really going on in South America,
you know, and this kind of a thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: this big contradictions worldwide,
you know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also contradictions even here
where you guys are ending prohibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big contradiction that we can't even smoke
in the pot even if it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go for South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Chile this year they authorized this
growing for medical patients for 500
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was made by a foundation called Daya
and the government of one of the counties
[SPEAKER_00]: of Santiago, Chile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that they are continuing to
discuss the commissions in Congress,
[SPEAKER_00]: the change of the law, the law number $20
and that's the name of the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're changing it for authorizing
six plants per resident and about half
[SPEAKER_00]: kilo of dry buds in each property.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're discussing now,
but it's not done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to finish it, but it's not
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Chile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a great community, a great
cannabis community in Chile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make like every year they make the
expo weed, which is a three day event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one they had around 72 70,000
70,000 personas attending for the three
[SPEAKER_00]: day event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have the global marijuana march,
which is we have here on my right,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Dana Pio, which is a big responsible
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give an applause for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all these years of making the march so
successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this march in Santiago gathered around
more than like about 300,000 personas this
[SPEAKER_00]: year in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Argentina, the same march gathered
around 200,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So huge, huge, massive event.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that they absolutely feel better by
consuming this herb, but there's not much
[SPEAKER_00]: culture about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people want freedom, but they
don't know the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know all the uses of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in the process of educating all
these massive amounts of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for the herbs freedom,
but we're lack of culture yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to go through a big process of
education and that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me get to Gaston.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to finish with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been here in America for a few weeks
now and we've been observing what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to salute, how do you say,
congratulate all the hardworking activists
[SPEAKER_00]: that have made this ending of prohibition
a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the message is that we're not done
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep on continuing with the
rest of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deliver the rest of America of free
thoughts concerning the plant because what
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys do here is very important for the
rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're not really conscious about
that, but whatever happens here has a big
[SPEAKER_00]: impact worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was here last year when you guys were
with Prop 91 and you succeeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to congratulate all the
hardworking activists and tell them that
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the hard work, but we're not
done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to continue spreading the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no hemp in South America,
only in Uruguay, a research project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have hemp, but we don't have it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to say about this new era
that's coming that I'm seeing here also in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States, part of the
contradictions is we should take the human
[SPEAKER_00]: barriers that made these limits of THC and
hemp, we should just move them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the task that is already,
we have to keep on doing that because
[SPEAKER_00]: those were part of a different time,
a time of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's a different time and we should go
forward in taking those artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: barriers and leave them to the plant grow
as it is naturally and take all the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been representing the growers a lot
because we have a home grow movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to say is that that's not
really important because that's not safe
[SPEAKER_00]: access for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to go forward in trying to find a
different way of getting access besides
[SPEAKER_00]: the home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys are a big example for the
rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think many of us are going to be
inspired by Oregon and by the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Oregon, I think the Oregon law is
really good and you guys have been
[SPEAKER_00]: following the information, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the money has been... That's right.
Thank you.
