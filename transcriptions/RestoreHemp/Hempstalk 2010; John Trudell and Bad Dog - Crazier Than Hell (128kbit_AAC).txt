[SPEAKER_01]: Feeling crazier than hell Got this time on
my hands And got you on my mind And got
[SPEAKER_01]: nowhere else to go The fires burn hot and
cold There's some place in between the
[SPEAKER_01]: melt and the freeze This need for reaching
for you You were all I could be Now I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: here wearing alone We were one Now I'm a
ghost Falling from my place in the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: This dizzy is out of control The world
keeps spinning I heard a vibrating echoing
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounded a lot like you Amongst the truths
I saw You were the one that I found Now
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm needing the remembering close Of
memories of you holding my hand
[SPEAKER_01]: Remembrances of laughter singing Songing
the nights with belong Sweetnessing the
[SPEAKER_01]: shelter of each other Reality,
the reality of safe feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: With all these times of missing you I'm
never not going to love you These days
[SPEAKER_01]: without you to hold my hand Feeling
crazier than hell This crazy goes on In
[SPEAKER_01]: this confusion of me's Crazy together or
crazy apart When crazy is crazy It's not
[SPEAKER_01]: always in our heads Sometimes it's in our
hearts Feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: crazier than hell Got this time on my
hands And got you on my mind And got
[SPEAKER_01]: nowhere else to go The fires burn hot and
cold
There's some place in between the melt and
the freeze
