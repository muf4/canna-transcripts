[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna tell y'all a little bit about
Glenn, I know about the state of the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The girls fall in love and have flowers
that can make your heart slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The funky blend with the pop could not be
resisted to rain and snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you struggle to plan far but don't
demand the best for it, you'll never hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the pioneers coming up, the weapon
trains with a canvas made of him.
Once again a different city girl on that
front, she said to be at the front again.
The first star to strike her so strong,
and the first constitution too.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's around the world for food,
fire, oil, medicine, and fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the world sees we won't have no
need for any of the oil, we can make
a little medicine that's free.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can feed the world with a tree of life,
and make it sustainably.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we cut down all the trees,
we won't have nowhere to breathe.
The world feels a little bit stiff,
again they've got plants to build a house
for our fields, and the guys might grow
wild and free, living the way that we
ought to be.
So I'm leaving my children in a better
world than my ancestors.
Whoa, whoa.
La la la la la la la la la.
Whoa, whoa.
La la la la la la la la.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, whoa.
La la la la la la la la la.
La la la la la la la la la.
Whoa, whoa.
When
[SPEAKER_01]: we see the lack of spirituality,
this one single plant can bring us back
[SPEAKER_01]: 10,000 years in history.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the Shiva, Puranas, to Jesus,
to Christ, to the Buddha, the pagans,
[SPEAKER_01]: the goddess, the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give you all the animals, be one with
all the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to see what's inside of me.
Yes, the edges of my teeth have a triple
of a third.
There is the mother that gives five
births.
And we can yell our religion with a single
grand plan.
We can start right now.
But if we cut down all the trees,
we won't have nowhere to breathe.
The world feels a little bit stiff,
again they've got plants to build a house
for our fields, and the guys might grow
wild and free, living the way that we
ought to be.
So I'm leaving my children in a better
world than my ancestors.
La la la la la la la la la.
Whoa, whoa.
La la la la la la la la la.
Whoa, whoa.
La la la la la la la.
La la la la
la la la.
La la
la la la la la.
