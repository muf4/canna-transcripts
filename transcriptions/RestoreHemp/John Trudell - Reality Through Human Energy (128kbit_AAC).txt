[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and whatever's going on in this
dimensional reality will never out-fight
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about out-thinking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about out-thinking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about that.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: About out-thinking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternative energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternative energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conscious, live thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Process of thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the alternative energy that can
make the change to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really have to understand what this
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really have to get it and understand
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we become that power.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power of the people that have shit to
do with the vote or any other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to do with thinking with a clear,
coherent, intelligent mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the intelligence clearly and
coherently.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much power do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you make yourself feel miserable with
your fears and your doubts and your
[SPEAKER_00]: insecurities?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do that, you have power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply put.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a matter, but that's power
used incoherently and chaotically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just think of some mental shifts here
and use that power clearly and coherently
[SPEAKER_00]: and real change.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the power of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: The voting is like using it as a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just use it as a tool, but your power
isn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your power isn't here.
Your power isn't there.
Your power isn't there.
