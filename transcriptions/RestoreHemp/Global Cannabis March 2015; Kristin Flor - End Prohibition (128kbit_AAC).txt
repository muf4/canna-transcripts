[SPEAKER_00]: I am the vice president of a civil rights
group called the Human Solution
[SPEAKER_00]: International We are a group that believes
that nobody should go to jail or die for
[SPEAKER_00]: our plant So today I brought with you guys
some of my members from Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Tony here and Adam and
Altogether around the nation
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working to end Prohibition 2014 by
delivering support right to the front
[SPEAKER_00]: lines of where this war is affecting us
the most regarding our Defendants and our
[SPEAKER_00]: prisoners right now in the United States
of America while we call it legal in all
[SPEAKER_00]: these states We still have over 50 people
serving life sentences for marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they will never get out We also have
defendants right here in Oregon facing
[SPEAKER_00]: time jail time prison time We have it we
have two chapters now in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm gonna invite you guys to get
involved I'm gonna invite you guys to
[SPEAKER_00]: please come out to the courtrooms when we
have hearings when people are at risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: going to jail I'm gonna invite you guys to
know that we have people Right here in
[SPEAKER_00]: your state that are in jail for marijuana
one being my dad's business partner Chris
[SPEAKER_00]: Williams Okay, if you guys don't know who
I am My name is Kristen floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I am the vice president of the Human
Solution International Because my father
[SPEAKER_00]: he died a couple years ago a very
tormenting and nasty nasty nasty death in
[SPEAKER_00]: federal custody Shackled to a hospital bed
because our plant is still federally
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal So while we celebrate all these
laws we have a nasty federal law That will
[SPEAKER_00]: shackle us and put us in prison for the
rest of our lives Just by following these
[SPEAKER_00]: laws because they contradict each other
when my dad died He died with broken ribs
[SPEAKER_00]: undiagnosed colon cancer liver failure all
kinds of nasty things happen to him Why
[SPEAKER_00]: they kept my mom in prison as well And all
they did is own a company and follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: state laws in Montana his business partner
right here He went to trial the jury
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even know he was a caregiver how
many people he helped Because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: allow state laws in federal court my dad's
other two business partners testified
[SPEAKER_00]: against him So how are we gonna end
Prohibition 2015?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we are not gonna snitch on each
other We're not gonna cooperate with the
[SPEAKER_00]: government and give them our information.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we're gonna stand up for each
other We're gonna go to the courtrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna wear these ribbons these
ribbons that you see me wearing That means
[SPEAKER_00]: that nobody deserves to go to jail for a
plant We're gonna wear them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: courtroom so the judges the prosecutors
and the jury sees them We're gonna know
[SPEAKER_00]: about our jury rights That's your power to
say not guilty if you think a law is bad
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're a juror you have a Right not to
only judge if the law has been broken but
[SPEAKER_00]: to judge that law and if you think it's a
bad law You can say not guilty and refuse
[SPEAKER_00]: to send somebody to jail for a victimless
crime That's something they won't teach
[SPEAKER_00]: you in schools that we have to teach each
other So we're gonna end Prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: through one court support to jury
nullification and educating about it and
[SPEAKER_00]: number three We're gonna defend our
prisoners We're gonna educate about our
[SPEAKER_00]: prisoners and let people know that they're
working as slaves for The top 1% of our
[SPEAKER_00]: nation in private prisons and they are
killing them if they can't work for them
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all paying them less than 15
20 cents an hour So I'm gonna urge you
