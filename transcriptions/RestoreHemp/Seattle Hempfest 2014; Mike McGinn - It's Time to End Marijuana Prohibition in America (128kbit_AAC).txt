[SPEAKER_00]: You know, five years ago, when I was
running for mayor, somebody asked me my
[SPEAKER_00]: position on marijuana legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my answer then was, if every
politician that ever smoked marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: voted to legalize it, it would be legal in
an instant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a funny line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I didn't think it was a big deal when
I ran for office five years to come out
[SPEAKER_00]: for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people of Seattle had voted to make it
the lowest enforcement priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state had medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I later discovered it was kind of a
big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of elected officials, lots of
politicians weren't willing to do it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a couple before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Goodman was in the state house,
was a real leader, and there were others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there weren't that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at where it is five years later,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years ago, you had to explain why you
were foreign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I think if you're a politician,
not just in the state of Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: but anywhere in the country, you're going
to have to explain why are you against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where this is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's amazing how quickly these things
can move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they move because people organize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't happen because of political
leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, most politicians will only do
what the public's willing to say they want
[SPEAKER_00]: them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you all made that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while I got you here, we're winning
this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another green issue we need to
win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the fight against global
warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I've worked on too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep helping you all with
pot legalization around the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: having sensible laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love you all to help me in making sure
that we make this planet right for our
[SPEAKER_00]: children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fight global warming, fight coal
drains, fight oil drains, and build a
[SPEAKER_00]: better future together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah!
