[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a Lowell George song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trucker's favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of mine, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warped by the rain, driven by the snow,
drunk and dirty, don't you know that I'm
still?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lord, I'm still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out on the road late last night,
I see my pretty Alice in every headlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alice, Alice, Alice, I've been from Tucson
to Tucumcay, to Hatchapita, Tonopah,
[SPEAKER_00]: driven every kind of rig that's ever been
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driven by the back roads, I would not get
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me wheat, white sand,
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You showed me a sign to be moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kicked by the rain, driven by the sleep,
had my head stoked in, but I'm still on my
[SPEAKER_00]: feet, and I'm still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lord, I'm still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smuggled some smoking folks from Mexico,
baked by the sun, every time I go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm willing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been from Tucson to Tucumcay,
to Hatchapita, Tonopah, driven every kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of rig that's ever been made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driven by the back roads, so I would not
get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me wheat, white sand,
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You showed me a sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be willing to be moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me wheat, white sand,
wine.
