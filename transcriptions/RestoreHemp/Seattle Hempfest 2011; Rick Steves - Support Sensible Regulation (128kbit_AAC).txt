[SPEAKER_01]: it's great to be here you know I'm a
travel writer and for me I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about this high is a place it's a
cool place it's a place where my speakers
[SPEAKER_01]: sound remarkably good where suddenly I'm a
good cook where conversations slither
[SPEAKER_01]: around like stray cats sometimes I just
want to go to that place you know it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: cool place other people do too but right
now today there's a 80,000 Americans in
[SPEAKER_01]: jail because they wanted to go there and
our government says we cannot go there now
[SPEAKER_01]: there are cases when our government can
say we can't go somewhere and I'll buy it
[SPEAKER_01]: you know but there's got to be a good
reason and I've thought long and hard
[SPEAKER_01]: about this and there's no good reason for
our government to tell us we can't go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the place where a lot of you are right now
I believe the responsible adult
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational use of marijuana is a civil
liberty now it's a drug I'm not promoting
[SPEAKER_01]: it it can it's not healthy it can be
abused it can be addictive kids should not
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to it if you drive intoxicated
by anything I think they should throw the
[SPEAKER_01]: book at you but that does not get in the
way of the basic principle that enjoying
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana is a civil liberty now our
government is waging a very expensive war
[SPEAKER_01]: against this idea the war against
marijuana is based on fear and lies it's
[SPEAKER_01]: costing us billions of dollars it's
demoralizing our police force it's
[SPEAKER_01]: corroding and eroding the credibility of
parents and teachers when they need
[SPEAKER_01]: credibility to teach our kids how to get
through the pitfalls of their young years
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's also messing up hundreds of
thousands of lives in the last year
[SPEAKER_01]: 800,000 Americans were arrested for
marijuana they've got criminal records now
[SPEAKER_01]: these are not rich white guys these are
poor kids and these are people of color
[SPEAKER_01]: and these are people who cannot get
through life with a bump in the road like
[SPEAKER_01]: that it makes it very tough now I bring a
European perspective into this discussion
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think we can learn from here because
they've got drug problems too and they
[SPEAKER_01]: treat it not as a criminal problem but as
a health challenge and as an education
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge if we can take the crime out of
this equation we're gonna do everybody a
[SPEAKER_01]: big favor my European friends tell me that
a society has to make a choice tolerate
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative lifestyles or build more
prisons and then they remind us that in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States here we're really in the
prisons we lock up eight times as many
[SPEAKER_01]: people per capita as the Europeans do it
either there's something wrong with our
[SPEAKER_01]: laws or we're inherently more criminal
people and I think it's the former what
[SPEAKER_01]: shapes American drug policy is fear and
we've got to overcome this fear a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans think there's a whole reservoir
of people that would love to ruin their
[SPEAKER_01]: lives if only marijuana was legal the fact
is if you legalize marijuana tomorrow not
[SPEAKER_01]: many more people would smoke pot people
who enjoy pot are already smoking and it
[SPEAKER_01]: just doesn't need to be criminal it's been
25 years since they arrested a person in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Netherlands for smoking pot and it
doesn't they don't consume anymore in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: statistically we Americans consume double
the Dutch average ten years ago the
[SPEAKER_01]: Portuguese decriminalized the consumption
of all drugs they just did a review and
[SPEAKER_01]: they think it makes a lot of sense they
take the crime out of the equation and now
[SPEAKER_01]: it becomes a health issue and education
issue and people who want to smoke pot
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility do and the sky does not
fall now this fear thing is really getting
[SPEAKER_01]: out of hand a lot of people think it's a
gateway drug marijuana a couple of tokes
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're on the way to being a heroin
addict but what they found out in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: is the only thing gateway about marijuana
is the fact that it's illegal because when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's illegal people have to buy it from
people on the street selling stuff that's
[SPEAKER_01]: more addictive and more profitable Hemfest
is an exciting celebration of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: culture but I feel a little frustrated
because I've been working 10 years to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to help all of us not be criminals if we
want to support or enjoy marijuana we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a fun party this weekend and then
we need to remember to take it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: suburbs take it to people who are afraid
take the scare out of it I got to remind
[SPEAKER_01]: you we've got an opportunity right now to
legalize marijuana in Washington state
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize regulate and tax now there's a
lot of idealists that don't like I-502
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's got a lot of limits on it
I'll tell you we got to get this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: through the electorate and there's only
one way to do that and that is to be
[SPEAKER_01]: practical and pragmatic and recognize and
acknowledge the legitimate fears and the
[SPEAKER_01]: electorate because to be honest you guys
don't vote like the frightened people do
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to vote and we need to present
them something that's not so scary and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what I-502 does we need to work
together to make marijuana not a criminal
[SPEAKER_01]: issue just like the provision of alcohol
was overthrown we can do that with
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana I am a hard-working kid raising
church-going tax-paying citizen of the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States of America and if I go home
after a long day of work and I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke a joint that is my civil liberty
alright so go make I-102 502 pass and have
[SPEAKER_01]: a great time here at M-Fest happy travels
even if you're just staying home thank you you
