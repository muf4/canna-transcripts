[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to the Seattle Million
Marijuana March, which is put on by the
[SPEAKER_00]: folks with the Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to document the march,
which leaves from Seattle's Volunteer Park
[SPEAKER_00]: and heads over to Westlake Park over in
downtown Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like a crowd of about 300 people
here at the start of the march.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing, so that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're about four minutes away from
the start of the march.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
