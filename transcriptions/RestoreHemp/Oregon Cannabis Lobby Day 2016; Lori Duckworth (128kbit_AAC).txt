[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Lori Duckworth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the former director of Southern Oregon
Normal in Medford, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in operation for a little over
four and a half years right next to the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal courthouse before we were raided
on May 23rd, 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband was the president of the
organization and I was the executive
[SPEAKER_00]: director.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both suffered from PTSD at the time of
that raid from childhood experiences and
[SPEAKER_00]: he also had a diagnosis of chronic pain
and eye of seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nearly a year after that raid when we were
prepared to go to trial with our lawyers,
[SPEAKER_00]: Leland Berger, who's here today,
thank you Leland,
[SPEAKER_00]: and my lawyer, Justin Rosa, a local
attorney in Medford, we took a plea
[SPEAKER_00]: bargain and the state of Oregon dropped 29
class A felonies against me and 28 against
[SPEAKER_00]: my husband in exchange for one class C
felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: The charge, delivery of more than one
ounce of cannabis to another medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana card holder for no
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not even a charge like that
anywhere heard of, but we took it so we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have to face trial and possibly
going to jail for the rest of our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our guns and our ammunition back
and our business closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately a year after that I was
diagnosed with cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my medicine now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take three grams a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current rules and regulations would
prohibit me from being able to purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: that in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank goodness we're good growers and we
have great friends that own extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that can help us out with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current rules and regulations that are
being imposed or proposed and I met with
[SPEAKER_00]: very early today early earlier,
they're going to hurt the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to damage the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This program has been the stepping stone
to legalization in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest all of you pick up a
Newsweek that just came out and read the
[SPEAKER_00]: story on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will explain to you how people come
into this state and take advantage of our
[SPEAKER_00]: program with illegal ways and means and
this is what happens to our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot stop fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, the honest people that have been part
of this program and we were card number
[SPEAKER_00]: 436, 436 in this state 17 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot stop fighting for this program,
for the protection and the preservation of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients are the building block of
foundation for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deserve better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The children deserve better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dying hospice patients deserve to not
die before they can access their medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: and dispensaries with their safety
packets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety packets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they get for three months while
they're waiting on their actual
[SPEAKER_00]: credentials to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them die.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hospice patient has to be deemed three,
six months or less to be hospice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get their actual card from the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk into a DMV and get your
driver's license a temporary.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks later, get it in the mail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it so cumbersome just to get your
OMMP card when we just bought them that
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy new what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Million dollar system a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ACMM has been a toothless committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be putting pressure on our
governor and on our state people in this
[SPEAKER_00]: building right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: To listen to the ACMM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are 76,000 strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never lose hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, where did all of that
marijuana come from that started
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown by the farmers under the
patient program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please talk to your local representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always walk the talk of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
