[SPEAKER_02]: Then happy fell down, broken into pieces
of light, fragments of shattering lull,
[SPEAKER_02]: glimpses of what once was, overwhelmed by
what is, what if, and what could have
[SPEAKER_02]: been.
[SPEAKER_02]: At first, it didn't seem like much,
but then each stone thrown had an
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulative effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether they hit or missed, each thrown
stone became a part of the wall they
[SPEAKER_02]: built.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then happy fell down, broken into pieces
of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: then happy fell down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turning quarrel into ritual, losing
balance turns habitual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else's truths are someone else's
lies.
[SPEAKER_02]: During those wars of scars, old wounds
keeping time, waging battle in the minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then happy
[SPEAKER_00]: fell down, broken into pieces of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's when love is blind.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it opens its eyes, it can disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality of what is happening is not
diminished by their unwillingness to
[SPEAKER_02]: comprehend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is them who diminish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then happy fell down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Broken into pieces of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then happy fell down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broken into pieces of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then happy fell down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Broken into pieces of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then happy fell down.
Then happy fell down.
Then happy fell down.
