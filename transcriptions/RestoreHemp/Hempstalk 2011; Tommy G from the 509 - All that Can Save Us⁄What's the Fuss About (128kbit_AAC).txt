[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny Hart, take it to me, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So listen close, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smiling, crying, and biding my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep singing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm bringing the dopest rhymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And though our leaders are all wires,
ain't no need to be pining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pass the jug of wine and y'all see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got to thinking what we're
drinking if we're shrinking that sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheap and she bop, come on, re-bop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let's pass that through round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk owners of this country, they're
tearing it all down to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they ain't making a single sound,
but they keep silencing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someday, it just might be famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more likely, end up looking like a
damn dick neramus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blow the glass and we'll grow the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good Lord done gave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all that can save us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all that can save us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that can save us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We position for a mission that we must
undertake to gain favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't waver, because there's so much
at stake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And though our leaders slowly bleed us,
man, how much are we going to take,
[SPEAKER_00]: y'all?
[SPEAKER_00]: For Joseph and Mary's sake, when are we
going to wake?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someday, we all might be famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 10,000 life-minded praises that claim
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blow the glass and we'll grow the grass
that the good Lord done gave us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all that can save us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someday, we all might be famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fly right by the moon and go circle
Uranus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blow the glass and we'll grow the grass
that the good Lord done gave us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all that can save us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm going to back it down just a
notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now listen close, see?
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever been to a drunken brawl?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the kind where the cops get
called.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always someone getting hauled away
to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever see a stoner picking a fight to
maybe crack a couple skulls on a Saturday
[SPEAKER_00]: night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt you ever will.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been lying to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now please, take my little truth,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody tell me, what's the fuss about?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just a band of hippies that won't
burn one down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll fuck, we'll probably fall
asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe drive the truck 10 miles beneath
the speed limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, what's the fuss about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, yeah, I got to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really hope when I wrote the
song that the message had been real strong
[SPEAKER_00]: so some folks, they might one day
understand now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That alcohol has killed so many more than
green bud ever will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look who's keep on score.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a matter of fact, you can't O.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: on weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been lying to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now please, take my little truth,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody tell me, what's the fuss about?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just a band of hippies that won't
burn one down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll fuck, we'll probably fall
asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe drive the truck 10 miles beneath
the speed limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, what's the fuss about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody tell me, what's the fuss about?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just a band from Spokane that's got
to burn some down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll fuck, we'll probably fall
asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe drive the truck 10 miles beneath
the speed limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, what's the fuss about?
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody tell me, what's the fuss about?
I don't get it.
Tell me, what's the fuss about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, what's the fuss about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, what's the fuss about?
[SPEAKER_00]: The good morning gave us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all that can save us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Tommy G from the 509.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the legends after 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking to come forward to
coming out and party with you guys.
