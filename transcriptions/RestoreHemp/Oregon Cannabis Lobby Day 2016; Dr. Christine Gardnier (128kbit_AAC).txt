[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have written this for the Oregon Health
Authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Dr. Christine Parala Gardner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a patient, a farmer, and a
representative of the organic farmers of
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern Oregon who could not be here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say to the Oregon Health Authority and
the Measure 91 committee, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: overstepped your legal and moral
authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not have the right to overturn the
will of 850,000 Oregon voters who directed
[SPEAKER_00]: the OLCC rec process to make no amendment
to the OMMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our medical marijuana program has been
described in places like Israel,
[SPEAKER_00]: Poland, Czech Republic, Spain,
and elsewhere as the finest medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis system in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Oregon has blatantly,
openly attempted to dismantle our program
[SPEAKER_00]: at breakneck speed with no patient
consultation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers of Southern Oregon and the
people of Oregon will not allow the state
[SPEAKER_00]: to eliminate Oregon's world leadership in
protecting patient access to affordable
[SPEAKER_00]: organic plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research on tobacco is in conclusively
tobacco impairs IQ and cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person dies from tobacco in the world
on average every six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is tobacco seed not regulated as
tightly as you have proposed that Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: should regulate cannabis seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis regulation must be no more
punitive than tobacco regulation since
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco is far more addictive,
more toxic, and kills Americans every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one has yet died of cannabis
intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excessive license fees harm the regulatory
system by discrediting the authority of
[SPEAKER_00]: the state to regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much are tobacco farmers charged for
drying and rolling their crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: OHA, the state of Oregon may not impose
any fee increases until small producers
[SPEAKER_00]: can see clearly how these funds will be
used to help small producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Oregon has forgotten that
most farmers in Oregon are not rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are struggling financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: The draconian proposed regulatory system
seems unlikely to benefit the people
[SPEAKER_00]: actually paying these licenses,
fees, and taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like taxation without
representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposing unenforceable regulations which
unleash the terror of police search
[SPEAKER_00]: without a warrant could be just the
tipping point to ignite Oregon's first
[SPEAKER_00]: civil war in defense of the Fourth
Amendment to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does our legislature want to take
responsibility for criminalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: law-abiding Oregon citizens?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will not comply with unjust laws and
rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world is watching decisions made here
with great interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the people of Oregon need to sue the
state to remind you that the sovereign
[SPEAKER_00]: right of the people of Oregon does govern
our state?
[SPEAKER_00]: My directive to OHA is to maintain OMMP
medical cannabis as it stands in January
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015 to protect patients and the quality
of medical cannabis produced in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make no change to OMMP in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: No compromise, no amendment to OMMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
