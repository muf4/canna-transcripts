[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, well what we are out to do is we want
to grow 500 acres under a center pivot on
[SPEAKER_00]: Navajo or Apache land.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to be ready for the success,
we need to have five acres growing hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: seed for seed to plant 500 acres,
assuming a hundred-fold increase each
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the year before that, we need to have
five hundredths of an acre, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 foot by 20 foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the year before that, we need to have
one hundredth of that acreage,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is two foot by two foot,
which is one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means we're four years away from
being able to grow hemp on a scale that
[SPEAKER_00]: could have a real impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, hold on.
