[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Brian Vicente.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an attorney and I run Sensible
Colorado, which is a non-profit
[SPEAKER_00]: organization in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been around since 2004 and our work
is sort of bifurcated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the lead organization that works on
behalf of Colorado's medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and a fascinating fact there is
about two years ago there were maybe 4,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado medical marijuana patients and
there's over a hundred thousand today so
[SPEAKER_00]: our phone is getting a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our phones certainly ring quite a bit more
now than they did two years ago which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, Sensible Colorado, we also work
on broader marijuana reform issues and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really for my entire professional
career been working to dismantle the war
[SPEAKER_00]: on drugs and so I guess I'm happy to
follow the senator because I think we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to move on multiple fronts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful to see legislators taking
this up but what can citizens do,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can your average Joe do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to some extent Colorado has
sort of forged a path which has been a
[SPEAKER_00]: roadmap for other states and other
activists maybe to get involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we are really close to ending the
government's war on marijuana in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that will happen within a couple
years and it has not been an easy road.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned a lot of lessons and I just
kind of want to lay out a little of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The underlying kind of theme of where the
activism has been at in Colorado is we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been all about forcing the discussion of
this issue and when I graduated law school
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2004 and of course my classmates were
going on to firm jobs and working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate world or perhaps being a
district attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't hang out with those people but
public defender, what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I'm actually going to work on
marijuana reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for MPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: for a little while and then got sensible
Colorado going and honestly people kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: laughed and didn't take me seriously and
we're sort of like well you know this is
[SPEAKER_00]: this is kind of a joke and I think we've
seen an evolution where you know those
[SPEAKER_00]: same people that would not return my phone
calls where there's legislators that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just wanted to talk about the you know the
word marijuana would just turn people off
[SPEAKER_00]: and I really think we've gone from from
marijuana you know just people snickering
[SPEAKER_00]: when they've heard that to this being a
legitimacy a legitimate policy issue right
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way I think we've done that is by
forcing people to say the word marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: to read the word marijuana to hear about
marijuana on the news whether it's medical
[SPEAKER_00]: patients or students standing up and
saying you know we're tired of policies
[SPEAKER_00]: that push us towards using alcohol which
is a much more dangerous drug we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to allow should be allowed to use
marijuana in the dorms or at parties and
[SPEAKER_00]: not be punished not kicked out of school
for using a less harmful drug and so
[SPEAKER_00]: really I think that discussion has been
key to getting people like the senator and
[SPEAKER_00]: people like senators in Colorado to to
consider this issue more seriously and to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to tackle it in short you know what
happened in Colorado on a recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: front was really kicked off by students in
2004 and we had two of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: universities in our state Colorado
University in Boulder 50,000 plus people
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Colorado State University in Fort
Collins take on the issue of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: versus alcohol right and it was led by my
the brave brothers and sisters at safer
[SPEAKER_00]: that I work with and I was involved to
some extent but essentially students
[SPEAKER_00]: saying enough is enough we want our
policies at least at least in the student
[SPEAKER_00]: level right in our handbook in our in our
university code to reflect the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: that marijuana penalties should not be
greater than the penalties for alcohol and
[SPEAKER_00]: both of those measures passed right so it
took kind of a radicalized student
[SPEAKER_00]: movement to kickstart this in Colorado and
that was then launched into Denver the
[SPEAKER_00]: capital capital of Colorado initiative
campaign was run much like is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: happening here in 2011 where enough
citizens get together enough citizens sign
[SPEAKER_00]: a piece of paper and you can put something
you can bypass the legislature right put
[SPEAKER_00]: put use direct democracy put in front of
the people and that's exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in Denver and I worked to some
extent on that campaign and I got to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you nobody thought it was going to win
right nobody thought it was going to win
[SPEAKER_00]: and at the end of the day Denver you know
essentially a city of two million people
[SPEAKER_00]: became the first city in history to
legalize marijuana right worldwide and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is just enormous you know and maybe
idealists like myself thought well now
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have actually changed the Denver
marijuana law our city code to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: adults 21 and older should not be punished
for possessing marijuana maybe things will
[SPEAKER_00]: change and in fact the arrest continued
and it was kind of maddening to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: other activists and probably to many
voters that said you know this is bullshit
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we voted on this and the police
have not really respected that so moving
[SPEAKER_00]: on from there a statewide push was run the
net the following year it only got 41
[SPEAKER_00]: percent but 41 percent ain't bad you know
we've shown that we're actually gaining
[SPEAKER_00]: support every year we went back to Denver
with another initiative in 2007 which was
[SPEAKER_00]: a lowest law enforcement priority
initiative very similar to what Seattle
[SPEAKER_00]: has in that basically says for police and
prosecutors marijuana possession should be
[SPEAKER_00]: the lowest priority and we appointed a
mayor's panel I serve on that panel on the
[SPEAKER_00]: chair actually in the vice chair as a
police officer it's uncomfortable meetings
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes but you know we've seen a sort
of downward trend I think in the arrest
[SPEAKER_00]: which is been positive so the other quick
aspect you know we've had some other
[SPEAKER_00]: action in Colorado people in Breckenridge
people in Durango people in smaller cities
[SPEAKER_00]: we've gotten together and changed their
local laws and all that helps me it really
[SPEAKER_00]: gets news out there and all of these
events all of these changes in our laws
[SPEAKER_00]: are accompanied by people like me people
like you writing press releases sending it
[SPEAKER_00]: out you know emailing out press releases
getting having a press conferences things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that that maybe can be seem a little
intuitive we're not taught how to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: in law school or in college frankly but
it's incredibly important to do to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: word out so you're actually reaching a
broader audience you're getting people to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about marijuana to read about it in
their local paper in the state paper you
[SPEAKER_00]: know your stunts on the news that sort of
thing you know can just be incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: useful you know the medical marijuana
stuff in Colorado we've of course it was
[SPEAKER_00]: initially brought on by the people in 2000
we got our medical marijuana law and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we've had this just incredible growth in
our program which I pointed out and that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually led to the legislature picking
this up so again we have the people kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of driving the boat and eventually eight
years after our law passed the actually
[SPEAKER_00]: ten years after our law passed the
legislature decided oh well we're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going to regulate this and we passed is an
absolute landmark piece of legislation
[SPEAKER_00]: last year in the Colorado legislative
session which is the most comprehensive
[SPEAKER_00]: framework for marijuana regulation in the
world I don't know but we now have about a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand licensed dispensaries we also and
these are state licensed right there they
[SPEAKER_00]: ain't going away we also have about 200 to
300 edible producers who are separately
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed and they're all being taxed and
you know I think some skeptics may say
[SPEAKER_00]: well this this may last this may not last
and to me what what shows that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going to last is we have a state
constitution that protects patients we
[SPEAKER_00]: also have a couple state laws but then
perhaps the most important factor is we
[SPEAKER_00]: have in a hundred person wing of our
Department of Revenue whose job it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: oversee these marijuana regulations yeah
it's a hundred government jobs that's
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome millions and millions of dollars
coming into our state economy to regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: these these medical marijuana businesses
and so you know citizens certainly get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved we were down there every day at
the Capitol trying to either do damage
[SPEAKER_00]: control or push ish push provisions of
that law which would help patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: help their providers and and to a large
degree we're successful so I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop going babbling on and turn things
over to Douglas but I look forward to a
[SPEAKER_00]: dialogue later on thanks
