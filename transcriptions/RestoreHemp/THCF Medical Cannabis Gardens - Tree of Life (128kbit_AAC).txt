[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna tell y'all a little bit about a
plant I know that can save the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows long and tall and has flowers
that can make your mind swirl.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a funky plant with a vibe that is
resistant to rain and mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the strongest plant I've ever known
to man, the best rope you'll ever hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the pioneers covered up the wagon
trains with a canvas made of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Washington and Jefferson grew it on
their farm, said to make the most of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first stars and stripes were sewn on
hemp, the first constitution, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is around the world for food,
fiber, oil, medicine, and fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we press the seeds, we won't have
no need for any of the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make paints and inks, or run our
car.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go back next season, it'll fix the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most nutritious seed we can put in our
mouth with omega-6 and 3.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can feed the world with the tree of
life and live sustainably.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we cut down all the trees,
we won't have nowhere to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll grow fields of hemp instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make our paper, build a house from
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the God's plant grown wild and free,
living the way that we ought to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gonna leave my children a better world
than my ancestors left me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana plant they often call it dope,
can also be made into oil or rope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say you smoke it and you feel
fantastic, but from hemp you can make an
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative to plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made from plants, not petroleum you see,
so it won't still be around if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand to three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can biodegrade, which means it'll be
less pollution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just another reason for a hemp revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will the flowers of the female hemp plant
make the best medicines on earth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Helps cancer and AIDS patients eat their
food, helps those with depression overcome
[SPEAKER_02]: the blues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Procopa, epilepsy, nausea, insomnia,
stress, neurosis, psychosis, pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: PMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the studies have been done and all the
doctors agree, but they can't make money
[SPEAKER_02]: off this plant you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's free, it grows from a seed,
wild and free like we ought to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the future is grown in our own
backyards.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we cut down all the trees,
we won't have nowhere to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll grow fields of hemp instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make our paper, build a house from
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the God's plant grown wild and free,
living the way that we ought to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gonna leave my children a better world
than my ancestors left me.
Whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: La la la la la la la la la.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the mid-1930s, it was a billion-dollar
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the invention of the quarter-killer,
they kept producing non-stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then a smear campaign with Mexicans to
blame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought of making people thinkin' to make
your brain go pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, it's never stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't like gettin' high off a
paint-and-crack rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to bring it back to nature,
time to bring back some life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the farmers do their jobs,
stop givin' them strike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Renewable resources, life-givin' forces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panels for your cars and saddles for your
horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: DuPont, Monsanto, makin' the wrong
choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suicide genes extinguishin' our voices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuttin' down the trees, polluting the
seven seas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leavin' the fate of the planet to the
corporate entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corrupt politics, warfare, disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to make a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to plant seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pepa show nutrition, heat the oil,
seize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you all the protein you will ever
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it in a sandwich with jelly
or jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or make it in a soap or a lotion for your
hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it into fuel, put it right in
our cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we won't need the oil and won't have
to start wars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it into paper, write as much
as you please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it grows like a wheat and we won't
have to cut trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So put your faith in hemp, such a
versatile plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't let the government tell us we
can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause hemp can help us all in so many
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't mean that we will all be
livin' in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's versatility, sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at history, it ain't no mystery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp for victory.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cut down all the trees,
you won't have no end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corrupt fields of hemp instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make up it, build a house from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the good guys that grow wild and
free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Livin' the way that we all feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave my children a better world than my
ancestors left for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, whoa.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
