[SPEAKER_00]: Our next speaker is not only the
presenting sponsor of Seattle Hempfest
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that huge banner THCF medical
clinic up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only the presenting sponsor of Seattle
Hempfest just presented us with a check
[SPEAKER_00]: for $25,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's a sponsor of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driving back from Oregon Country Fair last
year, about four in the morning I fell
[SPEAKER_00]: asleep at the wheel and I totaled my
explorer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I survived, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our next sponsor gave me that 2004
Pathfinder that's sitting over there right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, Vivian's so broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an activist, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so broke I didn't even have the money
to buy a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Stanford of the THC Foundation,
my good brother, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for keeping me rolling because I
know you and I have rolled many together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up to Paul Stanford.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll roll some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know, I want to give a big thank
you to all of you folks for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big thank you because, you know,
we got to come out of the closet and
[SPEAKER_01]: demand our freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been put down too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, marijuana prohibition isn't
about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a smokescreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: What marijuana prohibition is really about
is power and petrochemicals and the
[SPEAKER_01]: continued centralization of economic and
political control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our job is to speak truth to power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we are here to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank all of those patients
out there because it's only because of you
[SPEAKER_01]: patients coming to our clinics and
supporting us that we have the wherewithal
[SPEAKER_01]: to support this and to support the cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, marijuana to me is the creator's
greatest gift to humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that marijuana is the plant that
produces more fuel, more fiber,
[SPEAKER_01]: more food and more medicine than any other
plant on this planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go back, all archaeologists agree
that marijuana, him, was the first crop
[SPEAKER_01]: purposely sown by humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely among the first crops
and there's some evidence in Central Asia
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis cultivation went back 40,000
years into the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could well have been the main reason that
our ancestors came out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hunter-gatherer way of life and started to
grow crops so they could have their stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still need our stash today,
you know, about 75 years ago, the
[SPEAKER_01]: industries that were affected,
the petrochemical, wood-based paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cotton barons of the South,
they realized that hemp was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: displace their economic sustenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they came up with the lies that they
presented to us as reefer madness,
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that marijuana causes us to go
crazy and kill our family and friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the lie they sold to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years of hemp fest and there hasn't
been any violence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an initiative down here in
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out there and get some signatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't get signatures,
give them money because every dollar you
[SPEAKER_01]: give them is a signature that you didn't
go out and get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every hour you volunteer to help them is
$10 they don't have to spend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes right down to you and me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to once again thank all you
folks for coming out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud that we can help and help us
restore hemp.
Thank you.
