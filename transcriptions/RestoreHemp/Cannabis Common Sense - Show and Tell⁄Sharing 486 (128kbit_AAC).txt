[SPEAKER_00]: Next up we have from Churchill and Drugs a
tincture of cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can read that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a little faded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we close in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Closer, closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tincture of cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is like an 1890s bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one is one of our nicer bottles
in the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of these actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a cork up here in the top which
is, they quit corking bottles of medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: back about 1890 as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Blissive Native Balsam for
coughs and colds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it contains a half a grain of cannabis
to the ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got the little fold out handout
here I'm going to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Bliss Native Balsam for coughs and
colds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contains two percent alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the large four ounce size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it contains one half grain of cannabis
indica to the ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the promotional materials from about
120 years ago read, we strongly recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: Bliss Native Balsam for coughs,
colds, bronchitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The syrup made of simple ingredients and a
pleasing taste acts promptly in soothing
[SPEAKER_00]: the inflamed membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a serious mistake to allow a cough or
cold to get started or to linger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carelessness will prove dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first feel a cold coming on or
notice that you have one, start taking
[SPEAKER_00]: Bliss's Native Balsam.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, keep the bowels open
with Bliss Native Herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bliss's Native Balsam.
[SPEAKER_00]: A full bottle and a nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next two medicines are veterinary
medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a colic compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Hess' Colic Remedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess you're supposed to force this
down the throat of your horse or cow if
[SPEAKER_00]: he's for the treatment of, according to
the back of the bottle, spasmodic and
[SPEAKER_00]: flatulant colic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gripes, acute or chronic indigestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impaction of the stomach, inflammation of
the bowel, impactation of the colon,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Dr. Hess and Clark of Ashland,
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next door we have for horses and cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says right here, for horses and cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabis, chloral hydrate and
cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this has 36 and two-thirds grains per
ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nifty embossing on the back of the
bottle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Sloan's anti-colic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sloan's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, jumping forward 120 years,
we have Manitoba Harvest Hemp Seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hulled Hemp Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Hulled Hemp Seed takes the outer
crunchy shell off of the marijuana or hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tastes like cashews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, it's really good if you
like nuts and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it says from the amazing hemp
seed, Manitoba Harvest Hemp Seed nut is
[SPEAKER_00]: created.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken the most nutritious part of
the hemp seed, the inner nut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove the hard outer shell and seal it in
a shelf stable package to lock in the
[SPEAKER_00]: freshness.
[SPEAKER_00]: To ensure quality, Manitoba Harvest grows,
processes and packages all of our own
[SPEAKER_00]: products daily in our kosher and USDA
organic certified facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp seed nut is a delicious source of
omega three and six essential fatty acids
[SPEAKER_00]: and essential amino acids or protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle it on your salad, cereal or
yogurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used in your favorite cooking
and baking recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep the temperature below 350 degrees
Fahrenheit so that you do not damage the
[SPEAKER_00]: precious omegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next order of that, we have to thank
IKO for donating this six pack of hemp ale
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Humboldt Brewing Company founded
in 1987.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an all natural hemp ale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been a few different hemp ales
out there over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come and gone, but this one's
still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can rush out to your store and get
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's family owned and operated since 1987
right down in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it.
