[SPEAKER_00]: I work with the THCF clinic and for me,
you know, I call myself Sister Tiva and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody laughs and but you know,
I really am a priestess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a totally high priestess and I am
actually trained as a Wiccan in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: radical tradition called the reclaiming
tradition where we blend our politics and
[SPEAKER_00]: our spirituality and that's why I do this
for a living because I not only believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but it's also a spiritual calling for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Wiccans believe that the
sacred is an everything in each person,
[SPEAKER_00]: in each living thing, in the earth,
even in inanimate objects that we are all
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the sacred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a very fine poem written
some years ago by a woman called The
[SPEAKER_00]: Charge of the Goddess and in there it says
that, you know, it says if that's what you
[SPEAKER_00]: seek, you find not within yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will never find it without.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's what I want to say
today that, you know, we're all seeking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all follow cannabis for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a healer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, some of us use it to heal
our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us use it to heal our spirits,
our emotions or the wounds that we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulated during our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's really important to use
it to find your truth and to act on that
[SPEAKER_00]: truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over and over from this stage,
all weekend, people have been telling you
[SPEAKER_00]: how you can get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not just saying that because we want
to like, you know, stand up here and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really mean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who's involved in this movement,
you've seen up here this weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: who you've seen out there working in the
booths and making this event a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was once just a person like you
who smoked pot and thought it was cool and
[SPEAKER_00]: you really wish it wasn't illegal,
but you weren't quite sure what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're all, we've all walked down
this road and we want you to join us
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's how it's going to become a
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how this sacrament, this thing that
heals us, that keeps us going,
[SPEAKER_00]: that raises our spirits, that helps us to
bond to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in our control to make it legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in our hands and we all have to do
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't just go home and think,
hey, that was a really fun festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hardly wait till next year and you
know, sit down and smoke your joint and
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of forget all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need you to be a part of this movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one of you have something
that you can give and I'm asking you now
[SPEAKER_00]: to give it and I'd like to paraphrase John
Kennedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he said, ask not what your country
can do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask what you can do for your country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to tell you, ask not what Bud
can do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask what you can do for Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows about the law of karma and
we know what people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what constitutes a person of character in
this society.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not right to take and take and take
and never give back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time to give back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody out there, I want you to think
about what can I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have very limited money and
very limited time and very limited
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, you can do something to make
this movement a reality, to make real
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, normalization,
decriminalization possible, to make it a
[SPEAKER_00]: reality in our lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't want to be 90 years old
and still have not accomplished this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at every single one of you out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out there in the tie-dye, out there in the
shorts with your sunglasses on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join with your brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make this a real heaven on earth because
we have the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blessed be.
