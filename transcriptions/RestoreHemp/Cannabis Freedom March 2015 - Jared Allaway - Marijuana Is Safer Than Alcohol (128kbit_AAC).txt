[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an occupational safety and health
professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked in various industries
including aerospace manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclear pellet manufacturing, nuclear
weapon demilitarization, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a safety professional over the years,
I looked at various material safety data
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found there is no threshold limit value
for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no permissible exposure limit for
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no amount of marijuana that you
can consume that will cause death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since I read the book, Marijuana is
Safer, so why are we driving people to
[SPEAKER_00]: drink?
[SPEAKER_00]: by Steve Fox, Paul Armantano-Masons,
Rirtwood Forward, by retired Seattle
[SPEAKER_00]: Police Chief, Norm Stamper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to spread the message
that marijuana is safer than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people in the audience
wearing Safer shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that some people make their
own Safer shirts using stencils.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalizing marijuana is more important
than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you take the selfishness out of it,
it can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best pot I've ever seen was
not grown for selfish reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown for people who need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since 505-2 passed, we have a limited
amount of time where we can still grow our
[SPEAKER_00]: own and share with Grandma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please call your lawmakers and tell
them to undo 505-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at R-76-No.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a table here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have the initiative ready to go
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to collect as many
signatures on a referendum as you do on a
[SPEAKER_00]: petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have to be printed on 11 by 17
double-sided paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 signature sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have some three signature sheets or
four signature sheets with mail-in
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we need to undo 505-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call your lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Participate in the referendum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Ready?
