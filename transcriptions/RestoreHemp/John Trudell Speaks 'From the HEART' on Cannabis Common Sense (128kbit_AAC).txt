[SPEAKER_01]: You are now a recording artist and you
have a number of albums out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, was it Jackson Brown who first
brought you into the studio?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how did that come about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it came about, you know,
I spent a lot of time as a political
[SPEAKER_00]: activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for me, as an individual,
I came to understand that that wasn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: that identity didn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, because it limited my perception of
reality because I was participating in
[SPEAKER_00]: reality from the perception of a political
activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter how righteous my activism,
no matter how righteous my cause,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm limiting my ability to see because I'm
only seeing as a political activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has its own limitations because I
think there are larger understandings that
[SPEAKER_00]: as human beings we need to be able to
experience maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that whole, as all that's going on
through my head and consciousness,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started writing and then yes,
Jackson took me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of like a fugitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jackson took me in into the world of
music while I was writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point I got the idea,
well I want to put my lines with music but
[SPEAKER_00]: as spoken word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I wandered off into that to see
what where it would go and here I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember it must have been more than
twenty years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I first came across a cassette of yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, this is in El Salvador.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is in El Salvador.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that one of your first ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the fourth album.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fourth album?
[SPEAKER_00]: We made Tribal Voice, which was the poetry
with the tribal music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then three years passed and then I met
Jesse Ed Davis and with Jesse Ed Davis I
[SPEAKER_00]: made Graffiti, AKA Graffiti Man,
which is now with the electric music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we made Heart Jump Bouquet and
then we made, but this is in El Salvador.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in 1987 we recorded that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like that tune Grass Fire Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass Fire, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My DNA needs T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing how the science is backing
that up more and more every day and we
[SPEAKER_01]: often talk about it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, you know, just in, what was it,
in 1993 they discovered that our bodies
[SPEAKER_01]: have this whole endogenous cannabinoid
system where we have these artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that kind of modulate the
rest of the endocrine system, the body's
[SPEAKER_01]: hormones and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do need THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Mother's Milk has endogenous THC
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My DNA needs THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason, right, that it gets
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I'm interested in,
I mean in a way is like, because what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're saying about this, see I think
that, what is this, Cannabis Sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well see what makes Cannabis Common Sense
to me is I think we really need to start
[SPEAKER_00]: putting some efforts into the legalization
of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put as much effort and energy into
the legalization of industrial hemp as we
[SPEAKER_00]: put into hemp that we can smoke,
if we put an equal amount of energy into
[SPEAKER_00]: that, because that's certainly serves,
it meets a larger objective of alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, because I mean, you know,
we make the fuels and the food and all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff, and it's, you know,
and I've had this lingering curiosity in
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of my consciousness, as active as
the cannabis movement is in its various
[SPEAKER_00]: levels and perceptions, right,
that I don't quite get why more energy
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't put into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it would say save the
farmers and all, I mean, there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be, and everybody's talk,
see, and people are starting to sit back
[SPEAKER_00]: now, the political system's starting to
talk about, well, in order to meet our oil
[SPEAKER_00]: needs, in order to meet our oil needs,
we'll do offshore drilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and people are, see,
and I don't see it coming, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to meet some of these energy
needs, industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we often talk about this study out
of Notre Dame University in 1975,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's published in a magazine called The
Midlands Naturalist, and it's a feral hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: in southern Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to that study, an acre of hemp
will make four tons of hemp seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: and four tons of hemp seed will make 300
gallons of biodiesel fuel or oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, those of us who come from the
hemp community, see, this should be the
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative form of energy that we're
putting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put as much effort into getting
medicine for the earth as we put into
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it for ourselves, see,
we have the energy to do it, it's just the
[SPEAKER_00]: focus and the consciousness, because what
I see as the imbalance, we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the benefits of hemp or marijuana,
medicinally, all right, for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also serves the same medicinal
benefit for the earth, and it does,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're not putting an equal effort into
what it does for the earth as we're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting into what it does for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see it really happening anywhere
to a large degree, but what we really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to have is we really need to have a
stimulation of the energy, consciousness,
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. John, our theme was industrial hemp,
man, we had a serious emphasis going on
[SPEAKER_00]: there on the treatment of energy.
