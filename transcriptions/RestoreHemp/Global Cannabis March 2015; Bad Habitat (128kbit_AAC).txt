perform for you, you're in for a treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to them, well,
basically my whole life, or their whole
[SPEAKER_00]: life anyway, because I've been listening
to them since they were wee little lads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been playing in the Milwaukee area
for god years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before my voice goes totally away,
I want to give this over to probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: best band in Portland right now,
Bad Habitat, guys.

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tryin' to be selfish, sometimes I
can't help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always want seconds after my first help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no matter how I'm doin',
I got room for improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why I do it in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the worst case of hunger that you
ever see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I never eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So forget what you're tellin' me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work hard, they say that I'll reap the
rewards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm seein' the score,
I start feedin' for more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And life ain't always fair, ask if feedin'
is your core.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or ask anybody who's spent more than a
week bein' poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody you meet is sleepin'
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes a bottle of that's keepin'
you warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get it, don't forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're sick of how you're livin',
you got two choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take either system or fight against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got my mind made up, I'm just waitin' for
yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the bull by the horns and tell him
you want more.
