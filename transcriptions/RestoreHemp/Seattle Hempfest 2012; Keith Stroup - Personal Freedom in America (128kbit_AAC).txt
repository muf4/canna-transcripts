[SPEAKER_00]: We favor the elimination of all penalties
for the responsible use of marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the right to grow your own
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we further favor the eventual
legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers want the same thing consumers
want in any other area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a high quality product that's
affordable and convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we support eventually full
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to drive down to the
local store and buy some marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know the strength of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And THC, and I want to make sure it
doesn't have any additives to it or
[SPEAKER_00]: pollutants in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are the marijuana smokers lobby in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the bad news is that we're still
arresting 850,000 Americans a year on
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another marijuana smoker arrested
every 38 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been more than 20 million
marijuana arrests just since 1965.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real problem with that policy is
unlike alcohol, where the government
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiates between use and abuse,
they don't arrest you if you're an adult
[SPEAKER_00]: for using alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only if you abuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet for marijuana, they act as if all use
is abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to make that distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana prohibition, for two or three
basic reasons, is incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: self-destructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, we're wasting something like $9
to $10 billion a year in law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: resources chasing marijuana smokers when
they should be focused on serious and
[SPEAKER_00]: violent crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, prohibition invites the
government into the privacy of your own
[SPEAKER_00]: home, where they know what books you read.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what music you listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how you conduct yourself in the
privacy of the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know whether you drink alcohol or
smoke marijuana when you relax in the
[SPEAKER_00]: evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's offensive to the concept of right
to privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government has no business knowing
whether we smoke or why we smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does that leave us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the good news is that we've got
three national polls that show we now
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy the support of a majority of the
American public.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gallup poll, the year we found it
normal, we only had 12% nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have 50% Gallup poll, only 46%
opposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Rasmussen poll, I think,
had 56% support.
[SPEAKER_00]: A third poll had 52%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are nationwide, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have largely won the hearts and minds
of the American people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Supreme Court decision,
and I want to read this simply because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to get the language wrong,
a couple of years ago in which Justice
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony Kennedy in the case called
Lawrence v.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas said, the following, at the heart of
liberty is the right to define one's own
[SPEAKER_00]: concept of existence, of meaning,
of the universe, and of the mystery of
[SPEAKER_00]: human life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a promise of the Constitution that
there is a realm of personal liberty where
[SPEAKER_00]: the government may not enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, folks, we're about to legalize
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You people in Washington have an
especially big role to play there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You vote for 502, and we're going to send
a message to Washington that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any choice but to rethink your
marijuana policy, because there are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a number of states are saying to
hell with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to enforce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, we're only incidentally
talking about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really talking about personal
freedom, that area where government may
[SPEAKER_00]: not go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support 502.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's finally legalize marijuana in
America.
All right, folks.
