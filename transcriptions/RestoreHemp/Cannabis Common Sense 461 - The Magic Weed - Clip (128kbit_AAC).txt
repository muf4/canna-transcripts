[SPEAKER_04]: We have a film clip we're gonna run it
this is from the magic weed a production
[SPEAKER_04]: out of Great Britain from 2005 enjoy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah The invasion of the two big hemp
producing countries China and Philippines
[SPEAKER_01]: was the start of hemp rationing Hitler was
also aware of the strategic importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp which is used in the making of canvas
and ropes both of which were an essential
[SPEAKER_01]: part of his war effort in 1941 when the
German army invaded Russia it blocked
[SPEAKER_01]: Britain's supply of Russian hemp Germany
managed to develop her own hemp production
[SPEAKER_01]: but the cultivation of this fiber which
had become so necessary in wartime was
[SPEAKER_01]: still banned in Great Britain in 1942 the
German troops reached the center of Russia
[SPEAKER_01]: the land continued to produce hemp which
enabled Hitler to move confidently to the
[SPEAKER_01]: next stage of his plans for the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: To safeguard its own supplies of hemp
Great Britain urged India to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile war was spreading to Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within little more than a year Japan
successfully employing once again the
[SPEAKER_03]: deceit and treachery which had so well
served her in the past had taken the final
[SPEAKER_03]: desperate plunge.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor forcing the
United States of America to declare war
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans realized they were cut off from
their hemp supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US Navy was totally dependent on hemp
for rock resistant ropes for their ships
[SPEAKER_01]: and for many other components.
[SPEAKER_01]: The American government then decided to
redevelop their hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana was legalized again and farmers
received seed a propaganda film called
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp for victory was then made to
encourage this war effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Allies air forces were completely
reliant upon hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parachute straps, packs and belts were
made out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: No other available fiber was so strong and
so reliable under combat conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: After General MacArthur had forced the
Japanese to withdraw from the Philippines
[SPEAKER_01]: and production soon reached pre-war levels
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the war years a new world arose from
the ashes of the old.
[SPEAKER_01]: India gained independence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to automation India doubled its
hemp production and increased its exports
[SPEAKER_01]: to America and the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: In peacetime the United States once again
banned the cultivation of hemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis but at the same time imported
millions of tons of hemp during the
[SPEAKER_01]: post-war economic boom to supply its
industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this is the Port of New York a
sprawling pattern of activity covering
[SPEAKER_02]: more than 1,500 square miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Its 650 mile waterfront an ever-changing
mirror reflecting the work of the world
[SPEAKER_02]: and its needs and tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grain from Canada and fish from Portugal
and Norway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tires from Akron and hemp from India.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the post-war years in France hemp
growing and processing went through a
[SPEAKER_01]: revitalized industrial revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is interesting to underline is the
fact that in France hemp culture went on
[SPEAKER_00]: in spite of American prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: While prohibiting marijuana in the USA
they prohibited hemp too and so you
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't grow it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: In France hemp growing went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: France was a very rural nation at the time
and remained so until the 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continue to cultivate hemp there
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened was that synthetic fibers
went on to become a huge development and
[SPEAKER_00]: even in France in a country where hemp
growing was still legal hemp began to
[SPEAKER_00]: widely decline until the hemp textile
industry finally died at the end of the 60s.
