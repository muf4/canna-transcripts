[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about the breadth of
different patients and the type of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients you see in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you had practiced as a cardiac
surgeon for about 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd see people who needed a heart
transplant or I know in one case we were
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing patients in Spokane and a fellow
said you had taken a bullet out of his
[SPEAKER_01]: heart about 10 years before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but in this case you're seeing patients
that are different from the typical
[SPEAKER_01]: cardiac patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have your hand inside a chest around a
beating heart is an extraordinary
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and I think it was one of these
experiences that kind of lit the fire if
[SPEAKER_00]: you will for me and for the future of the
use of something like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if I could just say a few words
Paul about one of the things that arises
[SPEAKER_00]: to the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when we see people in the
clinics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing many many people who are
coming in with problems associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: pain and this is a very important subject
that needs to be discussed in the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: field as well as the cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who become older users of narcotics
and opiates are frequently seen in our
[SPEAKER_00]: clinics and it's in large part because of
the inappropriate giving of narcotics to
[SPEAKER_00]: patients by physicians and we see this
constantly and here we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible medication which can be used
properly can be very helpful in getting
[SPEAKER_00]: people off of the use of narcotics and
opiates and this is one area that we work
[SPEAKER_00]: diligently on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I've seen the vast majority of
patients that come through with chronic
[SPEAKER_01]: pain issues who have been addicted by
their physicians to these things from
[SPEAKER_01]: Oxycontin to morphine to many forms of
synthetic narcotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say about 80 percent of them
completely get off of those narcotics by
[SPEAKER_01]: the time they come in for their renewal
the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe 10 percent have dramatically
reduced it and the other maybe five
[SPEAKER_01]: percent five to ten percent have continued
it but cannabis has been used by literally
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of thousands of people to help
quit their addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact you know we show these medicinal
bottles on our TV show all the time and
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things that it says on the
bottles is it's for the habituates of
[SPEAKER_01]: opiates chloroform cocaine alcoholics with
delirium tremens to help them get off all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those drugs so it's been acknowledged
as an aid in that for many many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah yeah nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frequently you can attach yourself to
something that moves you beyond the
[SPEAKER_00]: average and I think being a part of
medicine enabled me to do this first of
[SPEAKER_00]: all with the thing I love so much was was
taking care of human hearts and then when
[SPEAKER_00]: that time slip slide it away I could come
in and continue to work with humans and
[SPEAKER_00]: their hearts but in a different way by
advising them about how they can take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of their bodies how they can avoid taking
and eating the wrong things and the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: medications and I think I've been able to
realize a second coming if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
