[SPEAKER_00]: Right here from England, we have a bottle
of Chloridine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloridine was a typical, actually this is
from Australia, a typical compound that
[SPEAKER_00]: was used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to read what it says it's
used for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects great relief in all cases of
diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, fevers,
[SPEAKER_00]: neuralgia, bronchitis, asthma,
croup, cramps, influenza, and as a
[SPEAKER_00]: sedative medicine for the use in a great
many complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds very familiar, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a bottle of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually full of a hundred little
capsules from the manufacturing chemists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the successors to Bell and
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Cannabin Bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an extract of cannabis, strychnine,
and zinc phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabin Bell, a nerve tonic and stimulant
for the treatment of mental and physical
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaustion, depression, insomnia,
neuralgia, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: One tablet after each meal and at bedtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gradually increase your dose to two,
four times a day as directed by your
[SPEAKER_00]: physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got these nifty little green tablets
in there in the bottle and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a hundred of them in there and
they're about a hundred years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is from England.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an apothecary canister.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably would hold about a half ounce
or so and it's got a nifty little mark on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom, an L-E, and it shows some wear
with age on the inside a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one is from the Columbus
Pharmacist Company and it's Nervine
[SPEAKER_00]: Improved Elixir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nervine Improved Elixir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna pull it away and read from
the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains cannabis indica right up at
the top and it's useful in the treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: of congestive, convulsive, and reflexive
neurosis, insomnia, neurasthenia,
[SPEAKER_00]: affections due to derangement of the
nervous system, epilepsy, nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: insanity, dysmania, hysteria, and uterine
congestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dose is one teaspoon, four times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: For hysteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, hysteria and uterine congestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm.
