[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Mickey Norris,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mickey Norris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Engayo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Oregon Normal and the THCF
Clinic for sponsoring this great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also the director of the Cannabis
Consumers Campaign, which is a project
[SPEAKER_00]: that stands up for our equal rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any cannabis consumers out
there today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my people.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Cannabis Consumers Campaign,
we ask people to come to our website,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabisconsumers.org, fill out a survey,
send us your photo, and come out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we need to come out of
the closet is to show that we are good
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing members of our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my project, I show, I prove that we are
the good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not criminals in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we should not be treated like
criminals in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be treated like first-class
citizens that we are, because we are good
[SPEAKER_00]: taxpaying people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't deserve to be treated any
other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to stand up to this
discrimination in society that still
[SPEAKER_00]: exists against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to say no to drug testing,
which is a tool of discrimination against
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not test your impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't test whether or not you're
qualified for the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it does is test whether or not you
used cannabis in the last month or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they do hair testing, it could be
in the last six months or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's totally a discriminatory practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to say no to drug testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to stand up for our equal
rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to stand up for our right to be
parents and to have custody of our
[SPEAKER_00]: children.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to say yes to our right to freedom
of religion, those of us who use cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: as a sacrament.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people say that they get a
spiritual effect from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people get that effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel closer to nature, feel closer to the
universe, closer to God, closer to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a very healing kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people, aside from using it for
medical benefits, and thank God for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they use it for their spirituality as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to stand up for that right to
use it in that way as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when Gaio keeps making jokes about
short-term loss, memory loss, I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: say stop blaming pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to stop blaming pot for all these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep blaming pot for all these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to take personal
responsibility for ourselves and our use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another aspect of the Cannabis
Consumers Campaign that we advocate for is
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible use, knowing when to use it,
how to have a positive relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: it that most of us already have,
and to keep it as a very beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to know when to use it,
when to say no, how much we want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: it, where to use it, all kinds of things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a flyer over at the Oregon
Normal booth that you can pick up that
[SPEAKER_00]: also gives you some things to think about
and how to maintain your positive
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to take another,
I'm going to challenge Oregon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while Madeline thinks that Oregon is
superior, I'm going to give a plug for
[SPEAKER_00]: California here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, cannabis is still way too expensive,
and we all agree that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am firmly behind the $100 ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that sounds much fairer as a price
for your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But meanwhile what we're doing in
California, is we've got over 800 places
[SPEAKER_00]: now in the state, probably close to a
thousand, and including delivery services
[SPEAKER_00]: where people can buy cannabis over the
counter with your doctor's recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have over 300,000 people registered
as cannabis patients now because our
[SPEAKER_00]: program is not quite as restrictive as
yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much anybody who gets a medical
benefit from a certain amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: can get their doctor's recommendation
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're proud of what we've accomplished
in California in the fact that we do have
[SPEAKER_00]: great access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, people can grow
their own, and people are still joining
[SPEAKER_00]: collectively to have their own collectives
where they can grow a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to actually go the next step,
and that's what's happening also in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an assemblyman, Tom Amiano,
who's introduced some legislation that
[SPEAKER_00]: will legalize, tax, and regulate cannabis
for adults in the state legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Governor Schwarzenegger has said it's
time for a debate there because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: such severe economic shortfalls in the
budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have such a severe crisis, and they're
cutting programs left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to start thinking about the
revenue stream that could come into
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our board of equalization,
our state board of equalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: even said that they believe that with the
legal market in California, at minimum,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could expect to get $1.3 billion of tax
revenue from our cannabis consumers in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a lot of money, and people can
use that to help get health care,
[SPEAKER_00]: to help our education.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poorest students are paying for the
prison population right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should not be doing that on the
bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not be paying for the prisons by
raising tuition rates on college students.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have a prison system that
needs to release, according to the judges
[SPEAKER_00]: in California, we need to release 27,000
people from our prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we say, why don't we start with the
marijuana prisoners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they do not deserve to be in
prison in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're asking that for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have three initiatives that have
been filed to legalize, tax, and regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for adults in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if they make it to the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very good chance that one of
them will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might be voting on that in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But meanwhile, I'm also the publisher of
the West Coast Leaf newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have a copy, I believe
they have some at the THCF clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go pick one up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can subscribe to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gives you all the latest news on
what's going on in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can check it out online if you
can't get a hard copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's westcoastleaf.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to go there to find out
what's going on in the news and the
[SPEAKER_00]: politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the court rulings that are standing up
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to get involved with reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we do need all of you to get
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together, believe me, together we are a
big force.
[SPEAKER_00]: They estimate somewhere around 15 million
to 20 million cannabis consumers in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's no excuse for a prohibition
with those kinds of numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason is that we need to get
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to come out of the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to show them that we are the good
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they don't need to waste any more
money on prohibiting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's a waste of our resources,
a waste of police resources that could go
[SPEAKER_00]: for much better uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ask you just to think about how you
can come out, how you can get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're counting on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next time we come to Hemfest,
hopefully we'll have some more good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to take all of you to make
that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand up for our equal rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deserve nothing less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
