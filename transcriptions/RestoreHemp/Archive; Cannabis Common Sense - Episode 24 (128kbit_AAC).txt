[SPEAKER_00]: Video taped at the studios of City Video
at Evolution, it's time for Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Common Sense, the show that tells you the
truth about marijuana and the politics
[SPEAKER_00]: behind its prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here's the host of your show,
Paul Stanford and Paul Oney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our show is a production of our political
committee, the Campaign for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Restoration and Regulation of Hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are the sponsors of the Oregon
Cannabis Tax Act, OCTA.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an initiative petition that we're
gathering signatures on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'd like to have our attorney and
treasurer and chief petitioner and
[SPEAKER_01]: official ballot measure reader to go ahead
and read the Secretary of State and
[SPEAKER_01]: Attorney General's ballot title.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ballot title is Permit Sale of
Marijuana to Adults Through State Liquor
[SPEAKER_02]: Stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: The result of the yes vote, yes vote
permits state licensed cultivation,
[SPEAKER_02]: sale of marijuana for medical purposes and
to adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: The summary starts off, replaces state
local laws on marijuana except drive them
[SPEAKER_02]: into the influence laws, directs the
Oregon Liquor Control Commission to
[SPEAKER_02]: license marijuana cultivation by qualified
persons and to purchase entire crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Commission sells marijuana at cost to
pharmacies and medical research facilities
[SPEAKER_02]: for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also sells to qualified adults for
profit through state liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% of net proceeds go to state general
fund, smaller percentages for drug abuse
[SPEAKER_02]: education, treatment and promotion of
certain hemp products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bans sales to and possession by minors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bans public consumption except where signs
permit and minors bar provides penalties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very explicit ballot title.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tells you everything that our measure
will do and in a fairly good way,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the wording is kind of stilted,
of course, but it's a quite good ballot
[SPEAKER_02]: measure, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was actually drafted by the
Secretary of State and Attorney General's
[SPEAKER_01]: office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went through a process where it
actually went before the State Supreme
[SPEAKER_01]: Court because of an error that was made in
the Attorney General's office.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said it would amend the Constitution,
when in fact it's not a constitutional
[SPEAKER_01]: amendment at all, statutory measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that it went through the
Supreme Court very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went through in just three weeks,
which I think is a record for Supreme
[SPEAKER_01]: Court acting on something in a quick
manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got it out and we're collecting
signatures and we need your help to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to put this in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important issue on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a phone number, Paul?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a phone number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that phone number is 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like us to send you a petition,
we'd be very happy to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us a call at 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what about those who are web savvy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for the people who have an internet
connection or can go to an internet cafe
[SPEAKER_01]: or to a college or university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Multnomah County Library.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Libraries too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've mentioned that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you can go to any library.
[SPEAKER_01]: The address, it's right there on your
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put it in the location part of the
internet browser.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: That CRRH stands for our political
committee, Campaign for the Restoration
[SPEAKER_01]: and Regulation of Him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have to put this little thing at
the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: First to the web address, the http colon
slash slash, then www.crh.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually print our petitions
right from the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to wait for the mail and
you don't have to come to our office.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a lot of different things
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have information about just tons of
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why this initiative will be upheld in
federal court and how it was designed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be upheld in federal court.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of other things too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a great website.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has some of the historical documents
concerning the prohibition of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some great newsletter articles talking
about around the world, cannabis reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the Reefer Madness clips on there
for people who have the more souped up
[SPEAKER_02]: computers that can watch the downstream
feed of a film clip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all there for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But tonight we're here to help get you
involved to sign our petition because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just every day we see them more and more
taking away our liberties, our civil
[SPEAKER_02]: rights, our freedoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: The police more and more wanting to take
away people's homes and cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a great thing behind the
referendum that was, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_02]: the referendum, but the re-criminalization
of small amounts of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was passed by a state legislature
here and signed by Governor Kitzhaber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that is it's going to allow them
to take away people's automobiles and cars
[SPEAKER_02]: for very small amounts of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's just what the governor said
when he signed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, quote, this has less to do with
marijuana as it does with increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: police powers of search and seizure.
[SPEAKER_01]: End quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the governor spelled it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about money and search and seizure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to come in and if you've got any
marijuana at all, they want to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: search your car, search your house,
seize your property, and put you in their
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would also, that bill would also
require the suspension of your driver's
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be in your bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not be under the influence of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might find it in your sock when
you're in the woods out camping or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever they do, they can suspend your
driver's license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can take your property and they
can put you in their system where you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got to go through drug treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a sad case or a perfect example of
this is one of Portland's basketball
[SPEAKER_02]: players, I guess an ex-Portland basketball
player now, Cliff Robinson was driving
[SPEAKER_02]: downtown in a Humvee, a very expensive
vehicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the police pulled him over and they
found a gram or two of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if this were pulled over after that,
if this law went into effect, if it does
[SPEAKER_02]: go into effect, they could have seized his
Humvee for like a dollar's worth or less
[SPEAKER_02]: of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how much more ridiculous do you
want it to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what actually happens out there
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And less than a year ago, they arrested
another Portland trailblazer, Isaiah
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryder, with just under a gram of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went to court and they found him
guilty under the current law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it had been the new law,
they could have seized some of his assets
[SPEAKER_01]: and his belongings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he was in a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was in a BMW or some fancy
luxury car.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have seized.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the police are famous for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the recent Portland Hemfest in downtown
Waterfront Park, let me digress here,
[SPEAKER_02]: folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Jeff and Susie Crawford of
Bohemia After Dark for putting on the
[SPEAKER_02]: great Portland Hemfest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good success with all types of
music and lots of signatures gathered.
[SPEAKER_02]: But down there, the police had a what they
called on the side of it was a mobile
[SPEAKER_02]: command unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically a Winnebago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure it was a seized Winnebago
they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they now chocked it full of police
equipment, a mobile booking lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But something they obviously seized from
normally a law abiding citizen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just shows you what's the term,
the police industrial complex,
[SPEAKER_02]: what lengths they've gone to to keep
themselves employed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for a long, long time,
it was illegal for them to seize property.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the war on drugs back during the
Reagan administration, suddenly would they
[SPEAKER_01]: allow property forfeitures, even though to
me that seems to be a bill of attainder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Constitution prohibits bills of attainder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they went ahead and passed it and
declared it's constitutional.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're allowing police agencies to
seize people's property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that's become a primary
motivation for them, don't you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, very much so these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Marijuana Task Force here in the
Portland area, they've been quoted in the
[SPEAKER_02]: local media, mainstream media saying,
yeah, they like to bust marijuana growers
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's a nice, easy thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're real co-operative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have lots of things for them to
take, stereos, cars, houses, you name it,
[SPEAKER_02]: they take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're happy to take this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you don't have a house that
they can try and take, forfeit,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll take your stereo and TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a house that they can forfeit,
they'll leave behind your stereo and TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me it's not obvious what they're
actually there for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're there to make money and to
seize our property.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have anything to do with drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, too often when they
seize drugs, those drugs are back on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market the next day, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those guys are out there selling
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone in as an expert witness on a
marijuana case once, and they showed the
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures of someone's garden that they had
seized with all these marijuana flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you looked at the actual plants,
all of the flower tops were snipped off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for this is that the police
agents snipped those off and put them out
[SPEAKER_01]: on the market where they can make a pretty
penny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, marijuana today is more
expensive than gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $400 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more expensive than gold,
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, marijuana grows in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grows on trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15-foot tall trees.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it grows in a very few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, why should something like that be
more expensive than gold, which you have
[SPEAKER_02]: to dig out of the ground, deepen the
ground a lot of times, and destroy the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very labor-intensive, very
capital-intensive thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why marijuana, a simple little plant,
should be more expensive?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense unless you stop
to look at the military police industrial
[SPEAKER_02]: complex that makes money off of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to put people in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to grab a larger and larger
part of the economic pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do that by creating these laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look at the drug laws in
general, each year here in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, they arrest over a million people,
I think, on drug laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in the United States, we have more
people in prison than any other country in
[SPEAKER_01]: the history of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We passed the Soviet Union and South
Africa back about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have more people in prison than any
other country than the Chinese do per
[SPEAKER_01]: capita.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our country is the world's biggest police
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's frightening.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a little kid, I grew up in
Texas when I was young.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember in our schools in Texas,
they told us that in the Soviet Union,
[SPEAKER_01]: those dirty communists send police
officers into the classroom to intimidate
[SPEAKER_01]: children to turn in their parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, they don't do that in the
Soviet Union anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not even a Soviet Union anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Communism's not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have here in the United States
something that's much more insidious and
[SPEAKER_01]: worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We send police officers under the D.A.R.E.
[SPEAKER_01]: program to intimidate children into
turning in their parents and turning in
[SPEAKER_01]: their family and friends for minor
marijuana crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the overall number of
people that are arrested, 60% of all drug
[SPEAKER_01]: arrests are for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you take those out, you're left
with a very small number of people to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: When marijuana is legal, the rest of the
drug problem is going to be fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: insignificant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, you know, it's just really
quite frightening the amount of people we
[SPEAKER_02]: have in prisons these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you look at other industrialized
countries around the world, that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, studies show, all statistics,
that we have less crime in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States than the common market countries
have, you know, that we have less crime
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet we lock people up at a higher
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, because we're locking
people up for victimless crimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant to say that we have less victim
crimes here in the United States than they
[SPEAKER_02]: do in other countries, other developed
countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we still have a much higher rate of
incarceration just because of victimless
[SPEAKER_02]: crimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got people locked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's a horrible vicious circle
because down in California, the largest
[SPEAKER_02]: union now is the prison guard union,
which is really scary because they're the
[SPEAKER_02]: most powerful union now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they donate a lot of money every
election campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what do they want their legislators
to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Build more prisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a state can't afford to
have an empty prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would that look?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just go out and arrest more
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in California and now in Oregon,
the state is spending more money on
[SPEAKER_01]: prisons and jails and incarceration than
they're spending on education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's frightening.
[SPEAKER_01]: A college education.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spending more money on keeping
people incarcerated than they're spending
[SPEAKER_01]: on community colleges and universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a misappropriation of
resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing that primarily by
prohibiting hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to legalize the sales of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to regulate the sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just legalize it, but regulate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, the government has abdicated
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government has a responsibility to
regulate this market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, it's abdicated that
responsibility to the black market and
[SPEAKER_01]: those least able to control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act,
the government will come in and control
[SPEAKER_01]: the sales of the drug marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will tax it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will license farmers to produce the
drug, tax the recreational sales through
[SPEAKER_01]: liquor stores and bars and taverns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will allow the untaxed sale of
marijuana to medical patients in
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, it will allow
industrial hemp to be grown without any
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Industrial hemp can be used to produce
more paper, more fabric, more protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: and more oil than any other plant on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need your help to put these important
issues on the ballot and start the real
[SPEAKER_01]: debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get this thing where we're all
talking about it and we stop this war on
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get our petition 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look it up on the web.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got internet access or you go to
the library or university or internet
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee shop, you can look it up on the
internet at www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help us restore hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need your help to do that, don't we,
Paul?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need your help to restore hemp to its
rightful place as a medicine, as an
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial product that we've used for
thousands of years, as a pleasure
[SPEAKER_02]: substance that people can use responsibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this is about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about making choices and having the
ability to make the choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government wants to take away that
choice for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for why?
[SPEAKER_02]: For what reason?
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to have this prohibition
machine out there to control things,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's the prisons, the police,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just trying to control us all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our initiative, OCTA, the Oregon Campus
Tax Act, is about restoring our civil
[SPEAKER_02]: liberties, restoring our freedoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, our initiative will create
thousands of ecologically sustainable jobs
[SPEAKER_01]: by allowing industrial hemp to be
cultivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will allow patients to have access to
marijuana at cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, we were saying just a moment
ago, it's $400 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a real market, I think the price should
be more like $5 or $10 an ounce at
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum, maybe less than that,
maybe with taxes $5 or $10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, it's $400.
[SPEAKER_01]: That money's going into the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going into the hands of the people
who are controlling the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, too much of that
control is in the very hands of those who
[SPEAKER_01]: we hire to prohibit it, the police
agencies and the marijuana task forces.
[SPEAKER_01]: They not only seize our property to fund
their bureaucracy, but they take the drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: and sell them on the black market and lie
in their own pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our initiative will stop that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us a hand with the Oregon Cannabis
Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us, 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, our government, both the
Oregon state government and our federal
[SPEAKER_02]: government, spends so much money on this
war on drugs or the war on some drugs for
[SPEAKER_02]: what results, very little results from
their point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: People still use cannabis at the same rate
as they pretty much always have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're saying is education is the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that money they're going to throw
away on this war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And educate people so people can make a
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our founding fathers, quote
unquote, of our country, all believe in
[SPEAKER_02]: education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Education would make great citizens that
whole time period in the 1700s all across
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew him, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all across Europe and the US,
they said education is the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: They believed that within 100 years,
we'd reach this wonderful age where
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody would be educated and we all
would live in a great life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead, we're in Jefferson's worst
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a police state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thomas Jefferson, I think, would be
rolling over in his grave to see that hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: was prohibited today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thomas Jefferson brought certain hemp
fiber strains into the United States from
[SPEAKER_01]: Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also invented a device to process hemp
fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: That device mechanized hemp fiber
production by having a mule drive the
[SPEAKER_01]: device that was decorticating hemp fiber,
taking the bast fiber away from the herd
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that he was going to patent
this device so that he could give it away
[SPEAKER_01]: for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the 10th patent granted here
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he wanted to patent it to prevent
some interloping patentee from
[SPEAKER_01]: profiteering from distributing it and
stopping people from using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even George Washington grew hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: He even experimented with hemp and said
that he found the, quote, the artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation of hemp from Silesia of real
curiosity, end quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he was talking about paper
or fabric there, folks, the real
[SPEAKER_01]: curiosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he liked to have more time to use
this artificial preparation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was president when he wrote this letter
to a doctor in England who sent him this
[SPEAKER_01]: artificial preparation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he'd have to make more time for
that with the winding up of the session of
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very founders of our country were hemp
farmers, and they would be shocked to see
[SPEAKER_01]: today that hemp was prohibited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have people getting together,
the pharmaceutical industry and the prison
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and the police industry all
working together to ban a simple plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: to take away our freedoms, our freedom of
choice, because people have got to realize
[SPEAKER_02]: that, I think they also, they realize that
if we're allowed to choose our own
[SPEAKER_02]: intoxicant, we'll demand to make other
choices for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the government right now makes so
many choices for us, doesn't allow us to
[SPEAKER_02]: choose everything that you can think of
that they can't allow us to choose our own
[SPEAKER_02]: intoxicant, because then we'll start to
think for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that prison, police, pharmaceutical
industry just won't allow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they prohibited hemp, you know,
I think that one of the key factors was
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that hemp produces more oil than
any other plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces three times more oil than any
other plant seed oil crop that's available
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that hemp seed oil will run any diesel
engine with no conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the diesel engine, the first
internal combustion engines were invented
[SPEAKER_01]: to run on hemp seed oil back in 1884.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was 15 years before they
synthesized petroleum to be like hemp seed
[SPEAKER_01]: oil so that they could replace hemp seed
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason they wanted to replace it
is because they can do that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: centralized method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes millions of dollars to find oil
and produce petroleum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes billions to refine it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very capital-intensive industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you've already invested in that,
you're not going to want to let go of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to make sure you're going to
give money to your favorite congressmen
[SPEAKER_02]: and senators.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will vote your way to keep on the
prohibition of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very labor-intensive,
capital-intensive, not labor-intensive,
[SPEAKER_02]: capital-intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just sort of insidious the way it
has grown up and stopped all research into
[SPEAKER_02]: modern-day industrial applications of
cannabis and its byproducts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a whole exploding field in the 20s
and early 30s was finding all these
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful new uses for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has kind of stopped coal in the tracks
from the oil people and the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're out there just saying,
no, you can't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got together with the Bureau of
Narcotics in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And put a stop to it and put all this
propaganda so people would forget that it
[SPEAKER_02]: was ever a beneficial plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They totally separated the beneficial uses
from the, I don't know, well... They made
[SPEAKER_01]: up a whole misinformation campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that marijuana caused people to
go crazy and kill their family and
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, it doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they made up this propaganda
misinformation campaign so they could
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, you know, Henry Ford had
invented a car that the body was made
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp fiber and hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like fiberglass today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen old videotapes from the 20s
and early 30s where they take a
[SPEAKER_01]: sledgehammer and they swing it down onto
the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make a scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make a dent in that vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Henry Ford had synthesized a car made with
hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire body was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another one of the reasons it's
produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has nothing to do with drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drug issue is, pardon the pun,
a smoke screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's meant to detract from the real
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately today, it's this prison
industrial complex where we see more
[SPEAKER_01]: people in jail than any other country in
the history of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this destruction of our civil
liberties and the intrusion into our
[SPEAKER_01]: bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do they intrude into our bedrooms
and our homes to see what we're using,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll test our urine and test our hair
and try to say that we're using an illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is an herb that people have used
for thousands and thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with very little harmful effects,
no harmful effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people like drinking a martini
after work at your home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you put your feet up and turn on the
TV set and drink your martini.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of people do the same thing
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put their feet up, turn on TV,
and roll themselves a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all we're saying is give people
that choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether they can choose the
intoxication they like so they can choose
[SPEAKER_02]: a medicine that they like and prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can grow the crops that they like
and prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And use the paper that makes more paper
than trees do.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the USDA bullet in 404,
hemp produces four times more paper than
[SPEAKER_01]: the most productive tree species.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a waste product for making canvas,
rope, lace, protein, and oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need you to call us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need you to get this petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to put this important issue before
the voters so we can start the real debate
[SPEAKER_01]: and let the people know what is really
going on here and stop the buildup of the
[SPEAKER_01]: prison industrial complex here in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we say that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hate to be redundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to bore you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to put this on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need your help to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So call us now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't delay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a big voicemail system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll probably get bumped over to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But call us at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really in a hurry, go to the
World Wide Web, the Internet, and look up
[SPEAKER_01]: there at www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your pencil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write down that address right across the
bottom of the screen because we need your
[SPEAKER_01]: help.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and as we say, don't be
intimidated by the 15 slots there for
[SPEAKER_02]: names and signatures on our petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even one is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need, you know, everybody to help out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you may, you know, be the only one in
your family who wants to sign this or
[SPEAKER_02]: among your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll be out there petitioning,
and the one guy I have a group of friends
[SPEAKER_02]: will come over and sign it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rest of his friends won't,
you know, which, well, I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe he can educate his friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they'll sign it next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, a lot of people are afraid
to sign it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think their names are going to go on
some list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that if we don't get enough
signatures, we're not even going to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we do get enough signatures,
we turn it into the same list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we need your help to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: And call us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll mail it out to you in a plain brown
envelope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need your help.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, help yourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, help win back your own freedoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hemp grows more in a single
sentence than any other crop in the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperate, cooler climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces more fiber, protein,
and oil than any other plant on this
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to prohibit the plant that produces
more fiber, protein, and oil than any
[SPEAKER_01]: other plant, that, to me, is truly evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So help us put this on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to thank Lanny Swerdlow and his
club in downtown Portland, Evolution,
[SPEAKER_01]: for taping our shows and helping put this
on the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night.
