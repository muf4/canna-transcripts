[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not one for trying to find new ways to
do something that has already been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that, we were here once
before with alcohol prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for instance, the last call,
a book by Daniel Krent, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in reading that and looking at how alcohol
prohibition came to an end and the groups
[SPEAKER_00]: that were involved and how they went about
doing it, you know, the mothers that came
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, you know, protecting their
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a similar thing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many, many, many different
groups, many different perspectives,
[SPEAKER_00]: many different reasons for being here at
the table to end prohibition of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to ensure that we are working
well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well oiled machine because a lot has
to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot has to be done politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, what we want to do
is to remove marijuana from the schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: one category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, remove it from the
scheduling system altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so how does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not going to, you know,
reiterate what Dominic already talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about, but how does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two states right now, right here
in Washington and Colorado, who have begun
[SPEAKER_00]: to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 48 other states that are going
to move in a similar direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is how would he do it and how
quickly will they do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I think is
important as many of us here are from
[SPEAKER_00]: other parts of the country is that we have
to connect the dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to go back to our states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to talk about this, yes,
at the kitchen tables and in our own
[SPEAKER_00]: individual circles, but we have to make
those connections to the people who would
[SPEAKER_00]: be responsible in our home states for
doing what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city attorneys, for instance,
I'm from Maryland in Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give some examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Baltimore, where the city attorney is
Mr. Bernstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know Mr. Bernstein and I know
Pete Holmes here is my responsibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect those two people so that they can
begin a dialogue so that Mr. Bernstein can
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from Pete Holmes as to what's
happening in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What differences are being made?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who needs to be involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: City council members, connecting those
folks as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctors from Maryland need to be speaking
with doctors here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: The liquor control board folks need to be
communicating from Maryland to Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: state and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, however it's being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's an important piece of
it because I know people are in other
[SPEAKER_00]: states, just people who have the power to
make things happen in it, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wondering, so what's going on out
there in Washington state?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're developing their own
perspectives about what is happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't allow them to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't allow them to create myths and
rumors and innuendo and monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to show them what's happening here
and that the sky is not falling in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so those are just some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently we have momentum in what's
occurring with marijuana policy reform in
[SPEAKER_00]: this country and we cannot afford to lose
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that we can lose it,
in my opinion, is if we don't work
[SPEAKER_00]: together as a team in making this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to continue to say this
every time I have an opportunity because
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past I've seen infighting among all
of us that want to legalize marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: that want to remove it from the scheduling
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to get beyond our own
individual differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to leave that baggage outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick it up when you leave,
when we're all done, when we end
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick it up and carry it around
again if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this moment, for this effort here,
you've got to leave it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll end with this, you know,
the moms need to support the cops that
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of cops that want to
get it done, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all not members of league.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the cops need to support those
who just want the right to enjoy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who just want to enjoy cannabis need
to support those who come to here,
[SPEAKER_00]: to this place from a medical perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who come to this place from a
religious perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the many different places we come
from, we have to support each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the momentum going, and share what's
happening here in Washington and Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just with other states in the union,
but we're already beginning to see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening outside of this country,
in other countries, like in Central
[SPEAKER_00]: America, with Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The move that you are seeing in Uruguay is
because of what happened here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my two cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
