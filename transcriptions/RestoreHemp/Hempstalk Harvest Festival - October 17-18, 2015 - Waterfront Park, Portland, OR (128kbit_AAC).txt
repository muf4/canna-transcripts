This is
[SPEAKER_00]: a losing battle, now that the truth is out
Even the politicians have figured this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing out You can go ahead and help press,
might help you loosen your mind And
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize the herb and drop all the
[SPEAKER_00]: lies Help me struggle for freedom,
help put us to the test So it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: exercise our rights and put on a hymn set
And we'll educate the youth, soon we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: rule the land It's just a matter of time,
and it's time to take a stand This is a
[SPEAKER_00]: losing battle, one that money can't win
Bet going on for years, dress keeps right
[SPEAKER_00]: on going Like a cold war with the comics,
prohibition and the light You can throw us
[SPEAKER_00]: all in prison, but you cannot win the
fight This is a losing battle This is a
[SPEAKER_00]: losing battle This is a losing battle
