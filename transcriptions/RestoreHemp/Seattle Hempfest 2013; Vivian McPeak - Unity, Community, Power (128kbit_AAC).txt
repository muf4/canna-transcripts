[SPEAKER_00]: We've been putting up with people going to
jails and prisons for 1, 2, 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 5, 20 years for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an outrage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an injustice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not a threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're peaceful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're nonviolent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what's happening today at
Seattle Hempfest?
[SPEAKER_00]: The police are handing out bags of
Doritos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're winning!
[SPEAKER_00]: We are winning this war on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might be living in this oasis
called Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody, while Hempfest is going on,
somebody's life changed today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody had that cop car behind their car
today somewhere in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had their doors kicked in today
somewhere in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the handcuffs go on today
somewhere in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their life will never be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their family might be broken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might lose their marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might lose their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have their kids taken away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be put in jails and prisons
like a common criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When all they've done is kick back and
enjoy some music and watch some tunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And watch the TV and hang out and feel
good and relaxed while other people smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarettes into the cancer wards and drink
alcohol into the detox center.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever died in 5,000 years of
smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever overdosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever had a toxic reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever had DTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever had their brain fried or
their liver destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever gotten lung cancer from
marijuana despite the lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite the lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're winning!
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so beautiful to see this beautiful
community and culture here for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time able to celebrate a serious win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mazer 64 in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-502 in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ground breaking, potentially game changing
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our lives we lived under this meme,
this prevailing myth that marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition is an iron curtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing you can do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just blown that right out of the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that prohibition is more like a
brick wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took a few bricks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take another couple bricks out and the
right couple bricks out, the whole thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to come tumbling down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about if it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's about when it's going to happen
because we're going to win this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have to come back and do another
100 Seattle Hemp Fest, if our great
[SPEAKER_00]: grandchildren have to do this and bear
this weight and this load and this
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility, this stress and anxiety to
throw a Seattle Hemp Fest into Urban
[SPEAKER_00]: Center in one of the most beautiful series
of parties and parks right on the Puget
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound in one of the gems, right in the
view of the Space Needle, if we've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to do this, whatever it takes,
whatever it takes necessary to win our
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom and our equality and our justice,
we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just feels so good to be able to
stand up here with all these great
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers and activists and performers,
bands and DJs, vendors and sponsors and
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteers and this incredible beautiful
audience that's kept Hemp Fest violence
[SPEAKER_00]: free for 21 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beautiful, such a beautiful statement
of unity and community, of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Hemp Fest is an act of love for
all of us volunteers because we love this
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd and this community so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a leap of faith every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Praying nothing goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody jaywalks and gets hit by a car or
nobody falls on the rocks and or drowns in
[SPEAKER_00]: the water or walks across the railroad
tracks and gets hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing we want is for anybody to
get hurt at Seattle Hemp Fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for keeping it iry, being
responsible, keeping yourself safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay high, Drayden.
[SPEAKER_00]: High and Drayden.
Thank you.
