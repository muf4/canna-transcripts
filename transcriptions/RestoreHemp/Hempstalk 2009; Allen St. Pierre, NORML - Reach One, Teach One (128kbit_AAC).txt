[SPEAKER_00]: This state was the first state to
decriminalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Oregon was even ahead of
California in changing the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's no surprise to me that this state
continues to be at the vanguard of reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons why the state's
policies are as functional as they are is
[SPEAKER_00]: because people like Dr. Labeck,
for the better part of 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: have been helping citizens connect with
doctors to get the medicine that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my heroes for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This state has over, I believe,
25,000 registered patients at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: California doesn't have 25,000 registered
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to some places like Vermont and
there's like 250 registered patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 250 registered patients right here
in front of me, more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: This state has a functional medical
marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it perfect?
[SPEAKER_00]: By no means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are certain parts of the state
you can be a serious victim of geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, here in the greater Portland area,
maybe in Salem and Eugene proper,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get harangue that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But go dead east?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with California, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the coastal communities,
they basically have medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: retail access.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more easterly you go in a place
like California or Washington state,
[SPEAKER_00]: the harsher the laws get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are in a great part of the
state to be making this argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to recognize that we couldn't
be here without activists being involved
[SPEAKER_00]: for 20 or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Stanford, who heads up THC
Foundation, has been working for 25 years
[SPEAKER_00]: to reform laws at so many different
levels, whether it's been hemp or medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana or regulating the legalization
of cannabis for adult use, Oregon normal,
[SPEAKER_00]: voter power, and all the other groups that
predated them in the 1970s and 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1980s, one of the first votes for
medical marijuana, one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization votes ever happened,
Oregon Marijuana Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that legacy still lives on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be celebrating our own
personal freedom on a beautiful day in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet every 38 seconds in the United
States, statistically, somebody's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're hanging out here for five
or six hours today, hundreds and hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of people will be arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 2,000 people will be arrested today
in the United States for marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% for possession only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, I'm not here to convince
anybody or to deliver a polemical about
[SPEAKER_00]: the need to reform marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we have to do is to do something what
the black churches told people to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 50s and 60s, and that is reach one,
teach one, reach one, teach one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the law is where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change the laws at the local county level,
it percolates up to the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the nitwits in that
little dome building on that little hill
[SPEAKER_00]: in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: finally get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's a reason why in
Washington, D.C., the conservatives want
[SPEAKER_00]: to break up the Ninth Circuit,
which is the California, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii judicial
circuits, because here, the court
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions that are coming out are so
different than the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much more respect for personal
freedom, personal autonomy, and civil
[SPEAKER_00]: liberties on the West Coast than you get
anywhere in the Midwest, and certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: even where I'm from, in New England.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I always ask folks,
were you born here in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise your hand if you were born in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are fucking lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you moved here to Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are fucking smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really is how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we think we're all complicated,
sophisticated beasts, but we're mammals,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people migrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, people will migrate to where they
think they have the most personal freedom
[SPEAKER_00]: and the most personal autonomy,
the most amount of self-preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's no surprise that people are
moving in droves from the Iowas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Indianas, and Kentuckies, and
Tennessees of the world, and coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: California, and Oregon, and Washington,
because I think they rightly perceive that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have more personal freedom,
and the government respects their rights
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason why people in
Washington want to get rid of the Ninth
[SPEAKER_00]: Circuit, because these trends go from West
to East.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing coming from Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares about any socioeconomic legal
trends from Wilmington fucking Delaware,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Philadelphia, or Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: The serious social trends come from
Portland, from Seattle, from the Bay Area,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Los Angeles Basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, really take great pride in not only
walking around today and enjoying your
[SPEAKER_00]: personal freedom and the great environment
that is Oregon, but you've got to fight
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your legislature every single year tries
to roll back and retard the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year, Oregon Normal and others
fight hard for your rights to keep these
[SPEAKER_00]: liberties and to keep expanding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, while you're out here having a great
time today, vending and buying all the
[SPEAKER_00]: great stuff that makes this festival
happen, and listening to the great music
[SPEAKER_00]: and speakers, this is a First Amendment
freedom event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never, ever forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At its core, it's all about your own
personal freedom and liberation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't do our work in Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: without knowing that you support us,
and you have to know that for 39 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal has supported all the people that
get arrested, all the people that have to
[SPEAKER_00]: fake drug tests, all the people that would
have their children taken away from them
[SPEAKER_00]: because they use cannabis, that they would
have their student loans taken away from
[SPEAKER_00]: them, that they would have their very own
home taken away in a civil forfeiture
[SPEAKER_00]: proceeding, to have professional licenses
taken away like commercial driver's
[SPEAKER_00]: license, tugboat captains, nurses and
doctors and lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you so much for Oregon leading
the way and continuing to be at the
[SPEAKER_00]: vanguard of personal freedoms and liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is nothing more but a metaphor
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
