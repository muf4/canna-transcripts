[SPEAKER_01]: In between the blues There are good days
and bad days With everything and nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: to lose While the setting sun never sits
And the night has no limits The void
[SPEAKER_01]: between freedom and free Dealing with the
unnatural Reality A need to see A need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be Grass fire My DNA Needs THC Grass fire
In the world and yours That's the way this
[SPEAKER_00]: fire burns Like a grass fire
[SPEAKER_01]: In the unnatural society Been trying to
maintain While the same appear to be
[SPEAKER_01]: clearly insane With no way to explain
Outlasting the great lie A sparking spark
[SPEAKER_01]: does my mind Grass fire Pulling the sky
Breathing in Sativa's design
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass fire In the world and yours That's
the way this fire burns It's a grass fire
[SPEAKER_01]: The void between freedom and free Dealing
with the unnatural Reality A need to see A
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be Grass fire My DNA Needs THC
Dreaming of long times past All that those
[SPEAKER_01]: times brought Looking to the heart of
tomorrow Grass fire In a world that yearns
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way this fire burns
We are grass fire We are grass fire We are
grass fire
We are grass fire
