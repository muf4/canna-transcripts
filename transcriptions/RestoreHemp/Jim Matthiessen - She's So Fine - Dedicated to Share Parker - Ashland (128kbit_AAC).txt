[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a song for Cher Parker.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was my bass player for 25 years,
and a few years ago she got sick and had
[SPEAKER_00]: to leave the world and I grew a medical
garden for her down on the Klamath River
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few miles from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for any of you who are interested,
you could always show up June 8th at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyricka Courthouse where they have me up
on felony charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: For trying to grow medical marijuana for
my dying wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not too happy and I don't know who
all defends me in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I defend all that I can defend always.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd hope to see a few of your faces
there that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this song I wrote for Cher long
ago while we were playing music together
[SPEAKER_00]: for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's so fine Gonna love her forever In
and out of time This love will die never
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord, she's so fine Gonna love her forever
Rep
[SPEAKER_01]: when I first saw her I knew The way she
looked at me was like brand new In her
[SPEAKER_01]: mind was a room with a view I know she
loves me and I ain't no fool She's so fine
[SPEAKER_01]: Gonna love her forever In and out of time
This love will die never Lord,

[SPEAKER_01]: one's in love Her vibe, it hits you just
like a drug All the things you want to
