[SPEAKER_00]: This is Mr. Henry Ford in 1941 with
Popular Mechanics magazine showing off his
[SPEAKER_00]: car made from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that when the whole car itself was
made from hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says so right there in Popular
Mechanics, 1941.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: One more nail in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an eerie... I mean, they should
have never let us find that one.
Ha ha ha ha!
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha ha ha ha!
