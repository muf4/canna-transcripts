[SPEAKER_00]: If you think and you look historically
marijuana was not prohibited until 37 and
[SPEAKER_00]: so up until that time you actually had a
legal viable market and just because of
[SPEAKER_00]: market shares and let's say competing
market interest as it pertains to say for
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp you had Randolph Hearst
who wanted to ensure that wood fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: became the fiber for paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had DuPont and other chemical
companies who wanted to see cotton move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and so they wanted to demonize
marijuana and so and if you look at what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened with the prohibition of alcohol
you had basically the same setup it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: taken many more years because of the
interference and obstacles that came into
[SPEAKER_00]: place but clearly I think you will in fact
see a change and a rebirth of an industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of the things that's very
important to me is ensuring that local
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers will have the opportunity to
benefit what I think not only for the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp but also in the marijuana
for cannabis that's where we should allow
[SPEAKER_00]: for the growing to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see small businesses but it's
going to be a birth of an industry that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to bring a lot of new jobs to our
communities and you can see what has
[SPEAKER_00]: happened just in Colorado and what we'll
be watching in the next couple of months
[SPEAKER_00]: in Washington State to see how that plays
out and clearly we're in a position
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that we're the grass seed capital
of the world that we can grow and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been shown that we will in fact be able to
be in the market on a national basis and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be branded for the product that
we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will anything happen to people currently
in prison for marijuana related
[SPEAKER_02]: convictions and what about people being
charged at the time of legalization if it
[SPEAKER_02]: should happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the way it works is that at the time
of the conviction it was against the law
[SPEAKER_00]: and so those convictions will stand that
does not mean that the legislature cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: revisit and look at this issue on a let's
call it somewhat of a case-by-case basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect that once IP 53 whatever the
ballot measure number is passes the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature will start looking at what is
the impact on our prison system currently
[SPEAKER_00]: and how does it pertain to the changes
that we made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was just in 2013 we did a
remodification of the penalties that a
[SPEAKER_00]: person would face if they had previously
anything over an ounce was a felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: We changed that through the legislative
process to up to four ounces is now a
[SPEAKER_00]: misdemeanor and so I expect that you will
see at some point looking at what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost drivers for the prison system as to
what we think we should be modifying if
[SPEAKER_00]: anything at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no guarantee I mean the reality is
they were when they were convicted it was
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact a felony and so just the passage
of it will not change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well if there I guess is going to be based
on when the charging instrument comes
[SPEAKER_00]: through the reality we're going to have
this period of time over a year from
[SPEAKER_00]: basically 2015 up to 2016 that you're
going to have the transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would expect that you'll what you'll see
in many of the district attorney's offices
[SPEAKER_00]: and in that are an only district
attorney's offices do felony work they
[SPEAKER_00]: will start looking at what the reality is
as to what the people have actually passed
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do believe that you'll see charging
practices change based on the passage of
[SPEAKER_00]: IP 53.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the letter of the law nothing
changes the legislature could very well
[SPEAKER_01]: take that issue up and additionally we've
seen in especially Denver and Seattle once
[SPEAKER_01]: the law passed we saw prosecutors like
drop a bunch of charges against people so
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you will see practically speaking
an improvement in how people are treated
[SPEAKER_01]: but we may need a legislative fix
especially to look forward towards how
[SPEAKER_01]: much money we're spending on these cases
locking these people in prison if somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: happened to be in prison for four or five
ounces you know at their home which would
[SPEAKER_01]: now be allowed under new approach I think
that would be something that the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislature even potentially certain
judges definitely could look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have we learned from Colorado and
Washington and what are these two states
[SPEAKER_02]: done especially well or poorly from what
you've seen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure I think that in Washington the bill
was fairly poor it doesn't allow people to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow their own it does it limits the
possession to an ounce if you have over 28
[SPEAKER_03]: grams in Washington you're have a
misdemeanor if you have over 40 grams
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll go to jail so this is dramatically
better than that and in Colorado they have
[SPEAKER_03]: a particularly onerous system of
regulation that requires video cameras on
[SPEAKER_03]: the grow side from seed to sale with video
feed to the state store it's definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: over regulated we've seen prices of seven
and eight hundred dollars an ounce in
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington and several hundred dollars an
ounce in Colorado we're not going to wipe
[SPEAKER_03]: out the black market at those prices folks
I think initiative 53 will do that and a
[SPEAKER_03]: $35 an ounce tax is certainly reasonable
and I think it's a lot better.
