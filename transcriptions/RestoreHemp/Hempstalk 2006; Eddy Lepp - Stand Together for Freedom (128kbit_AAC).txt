[SPEAKER_00]: I tell a little story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've told it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you guys it real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps you'll understand then why I
do what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many years ago, I went to this little
shithole in Southeast Asia called Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it screwed up my head real bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for about 15 years, I didn't really
give a shit about my wife or my kids or my
[SPEAKER_00]: family or anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day I had a realization that
if I didn't change my life, I was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so about 17 or 18 years ago,
now I got sober.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would devote the rest of my life to
promoting the sacred plant at every level,
[SPEAKER_00]: both as a medicinal and as a industrial
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I would dedicate myself to
helping those less fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I started a ministry in 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2002, we were raided where they got 658
kilos, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figured we were safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next year, we planted over 1,000
plants, which we harvested safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the following year, they came in and
raided us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the following spring,
they came and raided us again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I tell you this background is
because I've based my entire defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm facing four life sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: $17 million in fines, an additional 40
years, and the part that really makes my
[SPEAKER_00]: balls ache, a $600 spatial assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the $17 fucking million.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can wait on a $600.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we have based our entire defense
on the Religious Freedoms Restoration Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows for the use of marijuana as a
holy sacrament.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for two years, I've been trying to get
this in front of a judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the federal government, the judge,
even my own attorneys have all conspired
[SPEAKER_00]: against me at every level to keep this
argument from going in front of a court.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a recent decision by the Supreme
Court called the UDV decision,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is incredibly critical because it
has to do with the church drinking what
[SPEAKER_00]: they call white tuska tea, which comparing
marijuana to that tea is like comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: ice water to battery acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Supreme Court said in a 9-0 vote,
leave them boys alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if they can let people French kiss
rattlesnakes, drink cyanide, drink a tea
[SPEAKER_00]: that they import in 50-gallon drums from
Brazil, then I am having a lot of trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering why they are so hesitant to put
a marijuana case in front of the judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell me it's because I would be what
they refer to as a gateway case,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that if I want one and you
guys all joins my church, we'd all be
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting here smoking pot right now instead
of wondering about looking over your
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be able to do whatever you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why my case is on hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it looks like they're going to
probably dismiss all of my charges,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're going to do it under bad
warrants so they don't ever have to
[SPEAKER_00]: address the religious issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that are disappointed,
this is where the story gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife, who was as bald as a baby fucking
bird and weighs less than 100 pounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: four months ago told me that she had to do
something before she died to make things
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she went down and she started her
own ministry because I couldn't do it
[SPEAKER_00]: through the one that we had started
together because of the legal problems I
[SPEAKER_00]: already had.
[SPEAKER_00]: She turned around at that time and sued
the Attorney General of the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Attorney General of the state of
California, the governor of the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California, all of the DEA agents in the
National Guard, highway patrol and
[SPEAKER_00]: sheriff's agents involved in her fucking
raids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now she has, I'm not sure,
but somewhere in the neighborhood of
[SPEAKER_00]: 35,000 plants planted back in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far they have come in and done
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot tell you what an honor it is to
have Jack Herrera for a best friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that peels by in person the honor I
have of having Linda for a wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: She personally is taking this to them in
such a way they will have to address the
[SPEAKER_00]: religious consequences of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it's settled, it will be legal
across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Jack sometimes has a little trouble
getting the message out because of his
[SPEAKER_00]: stroke, but in a nutshell, what he said
was hemp will save the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you will study the history of hemp and
marijuana, you will find that it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: main state product that has sustained this
world for over 25,000 years that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: prove in black and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said this last month in Seattle at the
Hempfest and I say it to you now,
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you, if we will all stand up
just one fucking time together,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will never have to stand up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70%, 70% of the Republicans in a national
survey admitted that they smoked pot and
[SPEAKER_00]: had no problem with marijuana as a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 70% of the people that fucking hate
us, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't we get the rest of us on board with
that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the people that we elect know that
they are our servants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that they kneel at our
feet, not rip out our throat and bite our
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be serve and protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's screw and prosecute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right in the Constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have any of you ever read that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a victimless crime, there can be
no jail time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you people sitting out there
today know somebody in jail that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: hurt fucking anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, put your hands up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the Constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing Jack said that's
imperative is you have to know your
[SPEAKER_00]: rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to understand the laws and you
have to understand your rights under the
[SPEAKER_00]: laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best thing that we can do is vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NAACP, the NRA, the multitude of
national organizations that create voting
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks control elections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
