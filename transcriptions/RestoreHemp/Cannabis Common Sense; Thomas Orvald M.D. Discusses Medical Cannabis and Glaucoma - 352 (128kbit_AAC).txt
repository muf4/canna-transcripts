[SPEAKER_00]: a disease called glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually a disease that is caused,
that is found in elderly people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ultimately, if it's not treated
appropriately, it can lead to blindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the pathology in glaucoma is that
there's an insidious increase in pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: within the globe of your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a normal pressure that is
acceptable in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is an excessive pressure that is
not acceptable in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the eye, this is a crude drawing of
the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cornea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the lens that's on the inside
of the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light comes in through this area here,
through the cornea, through the lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's focused on the retina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the retina is a light signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very sensitive coating of the
back of the eye here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the optic nerve comes in and
supplies fibers to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well in glaucoma, the pressure goes sky
high within this globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the treatment for glaucoma is to
somehow get the pressure down within the
[SPEAKER_00]: globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just so happens that one of the many
virtues of cannabis is that it has the
[SPEAKER_00]: capability of decreasing intraocular
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago, when I was active in
basketball, I got stuck in my eye by an
[SPEAKER_00]: index finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bled in my globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five years later, I got unilateral
glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well one of my friends is an
ophthalmologist and has been taking care
[SPEAKER_00]: of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an hour before I went to visit him,
I took a small amount of tincture of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in to see him an hour later.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the pressures in my eye and they
were seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is way, way down from the
pathologic pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, yes, my drops are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it wasn't his drops at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is a very effective way of
reducing the pressure within the eye and
[SPEAKER_00]: to preserve this wonderful retina back
here that transcribes all the visual sites
[SPEAKER_00]: into the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come to see us if you need to have some
help with the management of your glaucoma.
