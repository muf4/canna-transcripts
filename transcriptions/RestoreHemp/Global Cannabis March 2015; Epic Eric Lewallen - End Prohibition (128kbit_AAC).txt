[SPEAKER_00]: How y'all doing out there, Portland,
Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me start off by telling you a
little bit about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have muscular dystrophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was diagnosed at the age of three in my
first electric chair by the age of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was known as a pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: People never understood that I needed
certain things to make my days go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I learned that I wasn't a
pothead, I was a medicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was free from the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we have women, children,
men out there that are dying because they
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot get this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot have free access to the meds
they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not able to get themselves out of
bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not able to maintain a family
life because the government says we are
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y 'all feel we are wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all deserve the right to be
free and to take the medicine we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: help us relieve our lifestyles and pains,
whether it be PTSD, tremors, stomach
[SPEAKER_00]: aches, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know it's your medicine,
you deserve the right to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's just really sad that people
are dying and people have to fight for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cannot have access to your
medicine, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You fight, you fight, you fight just to be
totally healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to die, it's not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the access.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make it right for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to wrap it up and make it
real quick and simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical, social, recreational,
whatever it is, you all have the right to
[SPEAKER_00]: choose if you need it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that note, let's get ready for this
great march.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
