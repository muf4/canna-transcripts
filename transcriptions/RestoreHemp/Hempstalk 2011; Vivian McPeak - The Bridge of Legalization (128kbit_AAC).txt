[SPEAKER_00]: Hempstock, thank you so much for being at
this wonderful sacred event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a demonstration of two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a demonstration against the laws,
and it's a demonstration that we can come
[SPEAKER_00]: together peacefully over and over and over
with no problem, because the only problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with the whole cannabis thing is the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis prohibition, as we know,
is fixing a problem that doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had Hempfest this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was our 20th anniversary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hard year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, we had a five-month battle with
the city over the permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to give us a permit to
have the event, because they were building
[SPEAKER_00]: a bridge, a sky bridge over the road and
into the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a real big event with 150,000
people we had this year, 280,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big footprint event, and there's
not a lot of places in Seattle that have
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had a five-month-long permit
battle, and we sued the city of Seattle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we won.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we won a third day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the city said, you're too big
for that park, and we said, give us a
[SPEAKER_00]: third day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they says, well, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, because if you give us a
third day, that Friday is going to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: enough off of Saturday that there's going
to be enough room for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to work real smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, well, where's your science
behind that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a theory, and that's not
proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we won this year, we won the
third day as well, and Friday was our most
[SPEAKER_00]: attended day, and Saturday was totally
smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were right, and hopefully that's
going to have an impact on next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every year is a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, you've got to fight for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freedom doesn't come easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a lot of responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, at Hempfest, one of the
reasons we've gotten 20 years down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road with such a big event is that we try
to take a safety-first approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not always perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aim to please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our aim is not always perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we try to learn from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to always do a better job,
and that's gotten us down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here at Portland Hempstock,
you know, I've watched this event grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and blossom, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, this year is just so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just such a beautiful location with
such an iry ambiance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Hempfest, it's right by the water
and energy, which is always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weather couldn't be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of perfect weather to grow a big
stand of pot plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always a blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think often of Jack Herrera,
a friend of mine that I knew for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time, Jack only missed one Seattle
Hempfest, and that's the first year that
[SPEAKER_00]: he had his first stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, most people with their
career would have been over right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would have had an incredibly
illustrious career and all these books and
[SPEAKER_00]: his incredible work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he'd stopped right there, but not Jack
Herrera, he's not the kind of guy he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came right back the next year,
and he came to Hempfest, and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: hardly understand a word that he said
after his first stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he got up there on the stage in front
of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was so driven, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't gonna let that stop him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was up there, and sometimes it'd
take him 15 minutes to get his five-minute
[SPEAKER_00]: speech in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jack was back the next year,
and he was speaking a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's back the next year, and he's
speaking a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty soon, man, Jack was speaking
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was taking hemp oil every day,
and he was taking Rick Simpson's pot oil
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, because I saw him take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's gotta die, but Jack
Herrera really bounced back, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was one of the most driven people
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack, really, if you think about it,
he sacrificed his life for the Cannibs
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he literally went until he
dropped, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he dropped the first time,
he got up and he kept going again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second time he dropped,
he never got back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that guy is the true hemp warrior of
all time, and he was a great friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always gonna be something we
think about when we're at Hempstock of how
[SPEAKER_00]: much we love Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the people at Seattle Hempfest
this year on our main stage and a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of our other stages, we had something
really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had these thin, transparent prayer
flags on this really thin mesh cloth that
[SPEAKER_00]: had pictures of all of our fallen folks,
of all the people in the Hempfest family
[SPEAKER_00]: over 20 years who've passed away while
they were working on the cause,
[SPEAKER_00]: while they're a member of Hempfest,
of the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to really honor all those
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that always strikes us is,
man, I wish they could see how far we've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be so proud of all of it,
of everybody's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank all the volunteers with
Hempstock and everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot, in the Cannibis
reform movement, in the legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: movement for the last 25 years that I've
been actively involved in it, there's been
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of kumbaya camaraderie,
this kinship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody got along and everything was
rosy and wonderful because the nuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: bolts dynamics of legalization were so far
down the road, it was irrelevant at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like would you argue about
crossing a bridge while you still have 20
[SPEAKER_00]: miles of woods to get through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get to that bridge,
you're going to be arguing about how the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to get across that thing is we're
at the bridge of legalization now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, are we arguing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have different initiatives out
and different ideas on how it should
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of infighting within the
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just important for the community
to remember that we're a part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly beautiful, artistic,
peaceful, wonderful, gentle community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the activists have to realize that
we represent this huge community that's
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger than us and to try to keep as much
unity in our community as we possibly can
[SPEAKER_00]: while we increase the peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: SeattleHempFest.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see me walking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a book out this year called
Protestival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
