[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that any effort to bring
compassion to Ohio is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a medical marijuana patient in the
state of Ohio, like Bonnie said,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I support all efforts being made to
bring compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a patient in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got House Bill 214,
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced by State Representative Kenny
Yucco and State Representative Bobby
[SPEAKER_00]: Hagan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ohio's got a lot of exciting things
going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're trying to do it
legislative-wise, which I've been begging
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last,
[SPEAKER_00]: our legislators to stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got two different,
very different constitutional amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are trying to get into because one
way or another, Ohio's going to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we get our legislators to do it,
or whether we bring it to the people,
[SPEAKER_00]: because Ohioans are tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks ago, I was hospitalized with
calcium deposits on my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a CAT scan on me and saw that my
brain was covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've found, come to find out over the
past few years that I've been in this
[SPEAKER_00]: activism and in this movement is that
marijuana, or cannabis, or pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever you call it, or choose to call
it, is actually a neuroprotective and an
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidant, and it can protect what brain
I've got that isn't damaged from the
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium deposits that's surrounding my
brain right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't go get chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this fight has even become even more
personal because now it's a life or death
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that with my big, little,
long list of health conditions and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis treated, a lot of those
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it can actually protect what brain
I've got left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm hoping to do is get folks on
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a national level, to stand up and do
what's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now, I think it's y'all
that's gonna save my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain controls everything,
and I think I should deserve a chance at
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting for my life, even though our
government says no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't lie to us, though,
would they?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they own patents on cannabinoids
as neuroprotectants and antioxidants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they've had that since 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: How dare them to deny anyone the right to
use something that's safe as aspirin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Safer than aspirin, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have enough problems with my health that
I shouldn't have to worry about being
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecuted and terrified, terrorized by
our local law enforcement or even our
[SPEAKER_00]: federal law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the House Bill 214, the Ohio Medical
Cannabis Act of 2003, and 12, the Ohio
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternative Treatment Amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that's progress for Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that we're moving in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep us in your prayers, keep us in
your thoughts, and stand up and do what's
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna turn the mic over because we've
got a lot of wonderful folks that need to
[SPEAKER_00]: give their point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for giving me a voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming to this wonderful
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for inviting me to Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you.
