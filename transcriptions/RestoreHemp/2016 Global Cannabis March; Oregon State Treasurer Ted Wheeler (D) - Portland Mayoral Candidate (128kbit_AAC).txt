[SPEAKER_00]: It's so great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Ted Wheeler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to say, it excites me to have
been here today to talk to some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry leaders, some of the
cannabis industry entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am enthusiastic because they are
excited, they're pumped, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: visionary, and they're excited about the
economic opportunity of this industry for
[SPEAKER_00]: our state, for our region, and of course,
for the great city of Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people of this community, as you just
heard, overwhelmingly voted for a legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated tax cannabis industry,
and as long as I am the treasurer for the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Oregon, which is only about seven
months, and as a candidate for mayor of
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland, I promise you that I'm going to
do everything I can to uphold the will of
[SPEAKER_00]: the voters in this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a great amount of energy
here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pivotal time for our country,
for our state, for our city.
[SPEAKER_00]: But folks, let's be honest, there's a lot
more that we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard from so many of the
entrepreneurs about the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that Portland retains its
place as a respectful and open community
[SPEAKER_00]: to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do that, what's going to happen is
people are going to want to open
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses here, they will want to employ
people here, and that can only be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for our economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also understand that under Measure
91, there were rights that are ascribed to
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They deserve a safe, respectful,
indoor location to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the intention of Measure 91,
and we should work hard to uphold that
[SPEAKER_00]: intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to acknowledge that the
entrepreneurs that were here today,
[SPEAKER_00]: only a year ago, they were criminals,
and they were treated as such under Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to acknowledge that there is a
path here to help make sure that Fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: Start Oregon, which was created with the
legislature and other efforts,
[SPEAKER_00]: including expunging over thousands of
records, criminal records that were
[SPEAKER_00]: non-violent in 2015, has helped getting
people back to where we need to be as a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong community.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, here's what we've
got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to acknowledge the cannabis
industry for what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is legal, it is regulated, it is taxed,
and it's a tremendous opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: uplift our community, help get people
employed, reduce income disparity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we all know is growing across our
nation, our state, and our community,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can be a great boon to our
community done right and done well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as your mayor, I'm pledging to do
that.
Thank you.
