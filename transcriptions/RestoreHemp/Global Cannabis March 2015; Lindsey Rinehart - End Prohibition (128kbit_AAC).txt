[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm really excited that
marijuana is legal in Oregon and that
[SPEAKER_00]: 12,000 people won't go to jail this year
for cannabis.
Yay!
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we are working toward implementing
that law, we've come across some problems
[SPEAKER_00]: and that the Measure 91 committee decided
that Measure 91 was a good first draft and
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to do something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've had a time of coming together
and really communicating what our
[SPEAKER_00]: community needs because the Measure 91
committee did not follow what Measure 91
[SPEAKER_00]: said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure 91 said that OMA should remain
untouched.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said it three different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it wasn't a constitutional
amendment, because it wasn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: constitutional amendment, they changed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took it as a good first draft and
they're doing what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, tomorrow, Monday,
SB 844 is going to be adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some discussion if it's already
been adopted or if it's not adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's pretty close to adopted
as it's going to be until they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: take care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they've got dash seven
amendments, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to alter it sentence by
sentence, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's literally sentence by sentence,
change this word, adopt this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they've done is they've messed up
our grows, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They messed up our possessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They messed up our production limit for
our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a really big deal because
now a bunch of patients that were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have medicine from their growers,
their growers cannot give them that
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine for free because they're not
going to have a surplus of medicine to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to give away for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there won't be as many growers able to
help as many of these patients out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've put on some pretty strict
reporting requirements and they've put in
[SPEAKER_00]: some things like inspections for grows if
you designate somebody else to grow for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that person would be subject to
inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things like that that are
very alarming in this legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I would invite all of you to
do is to read it, get involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: show up in Salem on Mondays and Wednesdays
at five o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Measure 91 committee meets and they
have done a really good job about
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to what we have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recently called themselves a monkey
with a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called themselves a monkey with a gun
over our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need everybody here to show up and
tell them what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after they're done with this 844
amendment or the SB 844 and the amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: that go with it, they're actually going to
turn toward Measure 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Measure 91, they're going to be
looking at re-taxing and the taxing
[SPEAKER_00]: structures that were laid in place are
going to be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to look at implementing
moratorium and they're going to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing moratorium without putting it
to a vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things that they are not
allowed to do in Measure 91, but because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a legislative session, they're going
to be allowed to do what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really up to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the ones that voted it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the ones that wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the ones that have been screaming
out to be regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have to hold them accountable in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to tell them what we think about
what they're doing to our grow limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to show up and tell them what we
think about taxing our medicine or taxing
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to show up and hold these people
accountable because if you think they know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing, I want to remind you
again, he called the member of the
[SPEAKER_00]: committee that sat there and said,
we are monkeys with a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are monkeys with a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they do not know what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you saw a monkey with a gun running
through this plaza right now, what would
[SPEAKER_00]: you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You would try to disarm the monkey and you
would run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not just leave the baby
unattended with the monkey with the gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a baby, which is our program,
which is Measure 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a committee that's monkeys
with a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I need everybody to do is come
babysit the monkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have our baby and we all have to
babysit the babysitters, the monkeys with
[SPEAKER_00]: the gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need everybody to show up in Salem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mondays and Wednesdays, this whole next
month, they're going into the last bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: the session.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can visibly see that they're tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have definitely made an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that we're there the
whole rest of the session, because last
[SPEAKER_00]: time everybody got tired, we wound up with
moratorium all over the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: 126 counties, 36 cities, because people
didn't feel like going to Salem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you didn't enjoy not having
access to your medicine for the last year
[SPEAKER_00]: or you lost your job because of
moratorium, maybe we should all just show
[SPEAKER_00]: up and make sure that despite our
tiredness, we hold these people
[SPEAKER_00]: accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please come to Salem, submit emails,
make phone calls, be loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the time that they're listening
and read the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Oregon Legislative Information
System.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look up all of the legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can form your own opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no reason to be under informed in
this community, not one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be responsible and read the stuff
that pertains to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 40 pieces of legislation right now
that pertain to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all need to read them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to hold them accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please defend the OMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please defend your plant limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 plants in a residential area is only
two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have enough people growing in one
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not enough space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't have enough medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they want to have the medical
program, stimulate the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: program, until after outdoor harvest is
done, I really see a problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: shortages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, please show up in Salem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them what you think about what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give your thoughts and your opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then call them back up and ask them
what they thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold them accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they understand what you're
telling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any changes that you have to the
legislation, Representative Buckley has
[SPEAKER_00]: been very, very clear that if you're going
to give your thoughts and opinions on the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation, he and the other members very
much appreciate it if you're very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: on the line item and that you're talking
about, because then they can address it
[SPEAKER_00]: more promptly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, please show up in Salem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please hold them accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And come to One Draw Two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get free hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
