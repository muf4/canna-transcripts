[SPEAKER_00]: Live at the studios of city video at the
rage nightclub It is time for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: common sense the show that tells you the
truth about marijuana and the politics
[SPEAKER_00]: behind its prohibition Now here's the host
of your show Paul Stanford and Paul Loney
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of cannabis common sense our show
[SPEAKER_02]: is a production of our political committee
the campaign for the restoration of
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation of hemp we are circulating a
petition the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act and I
[SPEAKER_02]: would now like to introduce My fellow
chief petitioner our political committee's
[SPEAKER_02]: attorney our treasurer and the president
of the Oregon Wildlife Federation Mr. Paul
[SPEAKER_05]: Loney Well, thanks Paul for that fine
introduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah our initiative Was a comprehensive
initiative which would regulate marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: in a comprehensive system obviously It
would allow the sale to adults of
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana through state liquor stores for
a profit tax going to the state coffers to
[SPEAKER_05]: cut our state income tax and it will allow
at-cost sales of medical marijuana to
[SPEAKER_05]: patients with a doctor's prescription and
allow our farmers to grow Industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: the low THC variety to provide all sorts
of products of fiber food food fuel and it
[SPEAKER_05]: would Some of the proceeds would go into
drug education Programs realistic ones not
[SPEAKER_05]: the dare not the phony dare ones that
don't work And it would also go into
[SPEAKER_05]: treatment programs, which are desperately
needed It's say like I say it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: comprehensive system It's you know a way
to end the prohibition this that's
[SPEAKER_05]: destroying our way of life Destroying our
democracy and it's just causing tragedy to
[SPEAKER_05]: families.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know we can save untold millions of
dollars in tax revenue that's spent today
[SPEAKER_02]: on Incarcerating marijuana offenders
locking up marijuana growers We can bring
[SPEAKER_02]: in hundreds of millions of dollars in
revenue for Oregon State coffers Which is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to lower the tax burden on us all
when we tax and regulate the sales of
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana to adults So we urge you to get

[SPEAKER_05]: in Vancouver BC Exactly you know we've
been doing some shows now with Mark Emory
[SPEAKER_05]: the founder hemp BC Today's show we
thought we'd show you a different person
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the great things about Mark Emory
and hemp BC that there's been a great
[SPEAKER_05]: community gathering up there of just some
really wonderful folks doing great things
[SPEAKER_05]: and the person In today's interview sister
I see is another one of these fabulous
[SPEAKER_05]: persons that she's got a great story to
tell and she's a wonderfully strong human
[SPEAKER_02]: being yeah, she Mark Emory is actually
passed on hemp BC to sister I see so
[SPEAKER_02]: sister I see is now the proprietor of hemp
BC Mark Emory is actually keeping the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: sales business where he's the largest seed
seller in the world and he is keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis Canada, but he's turned over
management and ownership of Hemp BC the
[SPEAKER_02]: retail and wholesale outlet to sister I
see and we interviewed her I think you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna like this interview folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a real warm-hearted person and So I
guess without further ado let's roll the
[SPEAKER_05]: interview right
[SPEAKER_03]: City of Vancouver we are here at hemp BC's
retail store interviewing the proprietor
[SPEAKER_03]: sister I see thanks for having Sister
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's good to meet you and G
gentlemen and so here at the hemp BC store
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the hemp BC store?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the hemp BC store is a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a hemp store We carry a wide range of
different products everything from rope
[SPEAKER_06]: entwined to clothing to cosmetics Hemp BC
is also a place of advocacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We advocate the decriminalization
deregulation of cannabis in all its forms
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be you know hemp for fiber
and fuel and such and marijuana as well
[SPEAKER_06]: for its many uses MPC is also a pretty
major tourist attraction in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see a lot of visitors from all over the
world a lot of people from the states as
[SPEAKER_05]: well So it's just a few of the things we
are So you sell a wide range of products
[SPEAKER_05]: What sort of do you like it you have books
there?
[SPEAKER_05]: You have clothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a really large library everything
from information on hemp and its uses in
[SPEAKER_06]: industry to grow books to Enable people to
grow their own marijuana Do you have any
[SPEAKER_05]: problems with grow books selling grow
books here?
[SPEAKER_06]: It hasn't been a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've managed the store for a good good
time now and We've never you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the police have never given us any
problems about it So actually in the raid
[SPEAKER_06]: in December they left the grow books alone
and such When they you know took their
[SPEAKER_06]: paraphernalia and seeds and grew them and
they left the books alone So I guess it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not a concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the raid in December that was the
second raid there's been one some time
[SPEAKER_03]: before right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, January of 97 was the second one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right the first one was January 96 and
they did basically the same thing came in
[SPEAKER_06]: on mass and closed the store Stool pipes
bongs what they consider to be
[SPEAKER_06]: paraphernalia Seeds and in this raid
growing equipment lights and such so and
[SPEAKER_06]: then in both instances we were open the
next day and Doing a steady stream of
[SPEAKER_06]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for Fighting for our rights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and you know, that's what we
consider that we do here That's a large
[SPEAKER_06]: part of what we do is we are fighting for
individual rights and freedoms and we
[SPEAKER_06]: believe that it's everybody's own choice
You know how they choose to live within,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know certain confines that society
dictates and as a pot smoker I can
[SPEAKER_06]: honestly say I'm not hurting anybody By my
habit if you'd like to call it that
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly, I'm productive and contributing
to society in my estimation So it seems to
[SPEAKER_05]: me it's a act of civil disobedience,
you know, it's like when you got no other
[SPEAKER_05]: choice But you still have to live your
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then you come to a point in your
life where you decide if it's important
[SPEAKER_06]: enough something to fight for and I
certainly consider, you know, that's what
[SPEAKER_06]: I do here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Will you hear the the day of the
December 97 bust?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes when they came in I certainly want to
talk about that It's always kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting to me anyway to hear what
happens when they come in I guess this was
[SPEAKER_03]: a unprepared they came in with like how
many people?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really it was really quite
ridiculous You know and what when you
[SPEAKER_06]: could stand back and look at what was
actually going on There were 20 25
[SPEAKER_06]: officers that came in with a search
warrant.
[SPEAKER_04]: What time of day was this?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just about 420 That was kind of
auspicious in any case they came in with
[SPEAKER_06]: the search warrant and read the search
warrant to my assistant Tamara and And
[SPEAKER_06]: that stated that they were there to
confiscate illegal paraphernalia for
[SPEAKER_06]: illicit drug use and They proceeded kind
of they took the names of the customers
[SPEAKER_06]: that were here There were quite a number
of customers in the store.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a nice afternoon and let them leave
and Finally stopped Tamara from making
[SPEAKER_06]: sales.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was ringing in sales all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were It was really quite funny and
Got particulars from all the staff members
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they were told to leave I hung
around until Mark got here and after a
[SPEAKER_06]: little while They escorted us out as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, you're not allowed to stay on
premises while they're ripping you off
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a large demonstration kind of
gathering during this Everybody went
[SPEAKER_06]: outside and waited and as the crowd grew
and grew it was really quite Reassuring
[SPEAKER_06]: actually to see the support that we
gathered in such a short time,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know It grew to about I'm not even
sure maybe 300 people All standing very
[SPEAKER_06]: peaceably as pot smokers tend to do You
know around the police tape that had been
[SPEAKER_03]: put up and so it's kind of blocking out in
the street Or was it just on the sidewalk?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, we spilled over into Hastings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely Yeah, but that's because they
wouldn't let us stand on they had it roped
[SPEAKER_05]: off stopping traffic on Hastings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah, so how did the word get out for
all these people to show up?
[SPEAKER_06]: we actually got on the phone as soon as
the police came and started calling the
[SPEAKER_06]: local media and such and For the area and
the people who came out on foot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that the numbers in the area
What are Some of the other fellow store
[SPEAKER_05]: owners or store proprietors on the street
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do they think of your business?
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually were interviewed after the
last raid for that reason and most of what
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard or actually saw on TV was very
favorable They agree that MBC is a good
[SPEAKER_06]: thing on this block.
[SPEAKER_06]: We certainly have kept the the hard drug
users the other side of Canby Street just
[SPEAKER_06]: because we attract so much attention
there's always people coming and going and
[SPEAKER_06]: traffic and We're good for business.
[SPEAKER_06]: They attract a lot of people to this block
MBC is an extremely busy retail store and
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know all in all we're very good
for the area and they have said as much
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good to have support from your
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard when this first opened it was
boarded up and maybe burned out or
[SPEAKER_06]: something Perhaps across the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the first store Was an old boarded
up some kind of bookstore alternative
[SPEAKER_03]: something I can ask So do you also sell
hydroponic equipment and other things like
[SPEAKER_06]: that No, we don't any longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the little grow shop that that
was here when Mark owned the business So
[SPEAKER_06]: that's closed out that's closed as well as
Mark Henry seed sales are no longer
[SPEAKER_06]: on-premise This is here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not affiliated any longer And so
what we do have is the our big beautiful
[SPEAKER_06]: store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it is very So I understand there
were licensing problems and they said they
[SPEAKER_06]: weren't gonna they have licenses What City
Councilor City Hall had said to mark is
[SPEAKER_06]: that they weren't going to renew his
business license for this year I'm sure
[SPEAKER_06]: totally politically motivated,
but you know, whatever that's it's
[SPEAKER_06]: happened and So what Mark decided to do
instead of lose or risk losing the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: business?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he would have been you know
operating without a license and such I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: not sure how far that authority extends
but it would be better to divest himself
[SPEAKER_06]: of these particular holdings and in that
way we were able to retain I think about
[SPEAKER_06]: 21 of the former 35 full-time employees of
MPC the other 14 of course lost their jobs
[SPEAKER_06]: they were casualties of this drug war and
And so yeah, their employment was gone
[SPEAKER_06]: when the growth store and our wholesale
business closed down So but this way,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, there's still a lot of us
working and that's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, we're from Oregon,
you know, Oregon they've really cracked
[SPEAKER_03]: down we used to kind of be the Cannabis
Center of the West Coast until the 80s and
[SPEAKER_03]: the federal government started enforcing
federal laws in local Areas and people are
[SPEAKER_03]: being incarcerated for really long periods
of time and police are using infrared
[SPEAKER_03]: detection to find Halide lights and grow
operations and we like to tell people
[SPEAKER_03]: about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on here in Vancouver?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now that kind of Vancouver's been
the Center of freedom here at least when
[SPEAKER_03]: it comes to cannabis of a Western North
America as far as police efforts go,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean the police are always talking about
you know looking at looking out for the
[SPEAKER_06]: big growers the commercial growers the the
people like that who they assume are all
[SPEAKER_06]: bikers and What I know is that a lot of
people in Vancouver grow pot for their own
[SPEAKER_06]: consumption They may have one room in
their house where they have a light and
[SPEAKER_06]: they have some marijuana plants growing
and and That I think is the the largest
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of profile of a grower in Vancouver
definitely, you know is the personal
[SPEAKER_06]: gardener and there's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please don't harass them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're back and remind you once again that
this interview is brought to you by the
[SPEAKER_05]: campaign for the restoration regulation of
hemp and we're the sponsors of the Oregon
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it away Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will tax and
regulate the sales of marijuana to adults
[SPEAKER_02]: through state liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will allow adults to cultivate their
own marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will allow bars and coffee shops to
open up things like wineries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also allowing farmers to cultivate
hemp for fiber protein and oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will tax the sales of marijuana to
adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll allow the untaxed sale of marijuana
to medical patients with a doctor's
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need your help right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are less than halfway to the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need 75,000 registered Oregon voter
signatures by the end of June to put this
[SPEAKER_02]: important issue on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point we want you if you've
already got our petitions to mail them
[SPEAKER_02]: back to us today and if you don't have
them call us at 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll send them to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you mail some back to us, we'll send
you more.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need a job give us a call because
we might be paying petitioners to mail
them back today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So call us at 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very important that we get any
signatures that you have sitting at home
[SPEAKER_05]: on your desk, in your drawer, mail them
back to us because we don't want you to
[SPEAKER_05]: forget about them and then shake your head
come July because you forgot to mail them
[SPEAKER_05]: back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could make the difference folks.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: If all of you folks out there watching us
get a couple of signatures we'll be there
[SPEAKER_05]: and help us make our vision of Oregon with
regulated hemp available to all a reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a series of interviews up in
Vancouver, BC and they have their own
[SPEAKER_05]: vision up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have their own reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're creating their own reality up
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're creating a community.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've interviewed Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're doing Sister Icy and it's just a
wonderful community up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: In future shows you'll see other folks
that we interviewed from this great
[SPEAKER_05]: community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to create that community here
and you can help us create that community
[SPEAKER_05]: by giving us a call at 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a petition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get some signatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have questions give us a call or
write us and we'll answer the questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we only have until the end of June.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we're closing in with just a
couple months left.
[SPEAKER_02]: So send those petitions in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call us.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have access to the World Wide Web
look at our webpage.
[SPEAKER_02]: www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually download our petitions
from our webpage there at www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you don't have access to this
newfangled technology call us on the phone
[SPEAKER_02]: at 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us send you these petitions and if you
already have them please send them back to
[SPEAKER_02]: us right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and let's go back to our
interview with Sister Icy from Hemp,
[SPEAKER_05]: BC up in Vancouver, BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't she great?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very small country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vancouver is a little larger than our
city, Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Portland they're doing several a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Several a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they often do property seizures and
home seizures and things like that in
[SPEAKER_03]: conjunction with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they do that property seizure here in
Canada?
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually with the passage of Bill C-8 last
year they can apply to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can apply to have property seizures.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's never actually been tried.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there was a case in Victoria
where there was a house seized and what
[SPEAKER_06]: they have to do now is apply to keep it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, it's not been tested so we'll
see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just being implemented?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if Canadians stand for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, hopefully not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone's got to draw the line here
because property is being taken right and
[SPEAKER_05]: left in our country.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say it's a good act of civil
disobedience.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't agree with the law and you don't
want to change it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to live your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really corrupts the criminal justice
system as well because the police are
[SPEAKER_03]: going after property.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really looking and making
decisions on how much money they can make
[SPEAKER_03]: in doing busts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one horror story that one of our
guests a few months back, forfeiture
[SPEAKER_03]: attorney Constance Crooker was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of her clients was arrested for
growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took his refrigerator, his stove,
his TV, his furniture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they charged him in federal court
where he was facing an incredibly long
[SPEAKER_03]: prison sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: He committed suicide and his family went
to get some of his belongings back.
[SPEAKER_03]: The police said they wanted to keep his
refrigerator and microwave for their
[SPEAKER_03]: office.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: For shame, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really the situation in our
country, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a shame that our government's
pressuring yours to try to make it where
[SPEAKER_03]: fascism creeps here as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and it's becoming embarrassingly
obvious.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so here we are, doing what we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're going to stop it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and that's why I like your story
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting information out to people
so they can use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know how to grow plants if they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know the uses of plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can buy products made from a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just such an act of sort of being
it's right there almost is telling people
[SPEAKER_04]: something that they don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to educate.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the only way to change all
this is to make people more informed and
[SPEAKER_06]: to show them where the lies have been told
to them all these years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just we've got to stop believing
everything we're fed by the machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have to stop now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's great that you can take over
the business here.
[SPEAKER_05]: When did you take over the business?
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 8th of March.
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thrilled.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just an awesome opportunity that Mark
Emory has given me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I really want to live up to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a good challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So have you got any grand plans for how
you want to see the story evolve?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to keep growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to keep growing and keep
providing people with what they want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just going to see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not a firm believer in making
very concrete plans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things are a little more kind of unstable
than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're just going to keep going on and
doing what we know is right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in that, I don't think we're going to
fail.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so this is kind of neat that you've
been able to do this when the city
[SPEAKER_05]: fathers, mothers, they give you
permission, the proper commencement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have applied for a business license.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you only had it since the 8th of this
month, it's probably not enough time for
[SPEAKER_03]: much of it to get through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, those wheels turn slowly.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some concern from the people at
City Hall about seed sales and the gross
[SPEAKER_06]: store, both of which I've assured them
that both are gone and they won't be back
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope that just alleviates their
concerns.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we haven't heard backers yet,
so we're waiting patiently.
[SPEAKER_06]: The licensing inspector that I spoke with
a couple of weeks back when I went to meet
[SPEAKER_06]: with him assured me that he would not
close Hemp BC while my application is
[SPEAKER_06]: being processed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're confident that we can continue to
open our doors every day and do some
[SPEAKER_06]: business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do they give you a timetable when they
might decide?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's sort of a secret probation they
have you on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Double secret probation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're behaving ourselves, so I don't
foresee any problems that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty unusual.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't ever been the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's pretty unusual to come in and see
people openly smoking in an establishment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool, I think, really
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think so, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that like?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's any place else here
on this continent that you can see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to congratulate you for helping
pioneer this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot of brave souls upstairs,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, they're all doing what they
think is right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Mark Emery said something,
a time that really stuck in my head,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that is if you want freedom,
sometimes you just have to take it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an awesome feeling when it's brought
to my attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I do this every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't really notice anything out of
the ordinary.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we have people come in and say,
oh, that's amazing that you can do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's so free.
[SPEAKER_06]: And wow, Vancouver's such an awesome
place.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is that we're showing people
something that it's a glimpse of real
[SPEAKER_06]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's doing something that they deem
important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only a flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're trying to show
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're trying to present.
[SPEAKER_03]: A flower that hasn't caused one death in
recorded history is probably the oldest
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: All archaeologists agree that it's among
the oldest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, trying to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once again, I'd like to remind folks
that this interview with Sister Icy is
[SPEAKER_05]: brought to you by the Campaign for the
Restoration and Regulation of Hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have an initiative out there,
the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act, and we need
[SPEAKER_05]: your help.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will tax and
regulate the sales of marijuana to adults,
[SPEAKER_02]: allow bars and taverns, to sell taxed
marijuana to adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will allow the untaxed sale of
marijuana to patients, medical patients
[SPEAKER_02]: with a doctor's prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will allow industrial hemp to be
cultivated by farmers without a license to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce fiber, protein, paper,
fabric, rope, thousands of products,
[SPEAKER_02]: tens of thousands of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will raise hundreds of millions of
dollars in revenue to save all of us from
[SPEAKER_02]: further taxes from our labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lovely state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only taking registered Oregon voter
signatures on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need all of our signatures by the end
of June.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have petitions, please mail them
back to us right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have petitions, we'll send
them to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call us at 503-235-4606 if you're outside
the Portland area.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in Portland, call us at
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and, you know, we need your help,
and we need your signatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you got just one, you know,
this is the filled out sheet, which is
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beautiful sight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hallelujah!
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you only have two or three
signatures on there, or even your own,
[SPEAKER_05]: we still need that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mail it back in today, you know,
because every signature counts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of folks out there that
can only get one or two signatures,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe you can go get your
friend's signature or your partner's
[SPEAKER_05]: signature, and that would be fabulous.
[SPEAKER_05]: But give us a call, and if you have
questions, there'll be somebody there
[SPEAKER_05]: hopefully to answer the phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, leave a message, and we'll get
back to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we need your help getting this
on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to create our vision here in
Oregon, our vision of cannabis back to
[SPEAKER_05]: where it should be, restored to its
rightful place, and one of the many things
[SPEAKER_05]: that humans can use for medicine,
for food, for fuel, for fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: and for recreation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's restore that, folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us a call at 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_05]: Restore cannabis to its rightful place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can make it happen here,
like Sister Icy's doing up in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can make it happen here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we'd love to send you this petition,
so ask for it right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in closing here in the final minute,
I'd like to mention that on May 19th,
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be a primary, and if you live
in inner southeast Portland in House
[SPEAKER_02]: District 14, I am a candidate for the
Democratic nomination for State
[SPEAKER_02]: Representative from House District 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to abolish the income tax on those
making less than $40,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to establish ecological
sustainability taxes, and of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to tax and regulate marijuana out
of the hands of kids and substance
[SPEAKER_02]: abusers, put it in the liquor stores where
the age limit of 21 is strictly enforced,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act
will do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get this petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need your help to make it a better
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tune in next week for another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
