[SPEAKER_00]: Give me an H!
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me an H!
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourselves a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the greatest audience in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's this I-502 stuff going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are for it, some people are
against it in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one reform movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start dividing ourselves and being
angry and calling each other names and
[SPEAKER_00]: insulting each other because we don't
agree on the very fine points,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're defeating ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one, one union.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one reform movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always agree on everything,
but this is one movement, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not like a bunch of reform
movements.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I-75, or excuse me,
I-502 will be historic if it's passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be historic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some folks that are against
it, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a right to their opinion,
and they've got a valid perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have the folks from both
camps up here speaking because that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: HEMFEST is about, getting all the voices
out there, showing respect to everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: treating everybody with dignity and equal
respect, regardless of what the fine
[SPEAKER_00]: points are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all agree on the big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to change the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One community, one movement, one reform
entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
