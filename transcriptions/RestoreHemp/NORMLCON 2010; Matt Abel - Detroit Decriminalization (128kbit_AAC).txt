[SPEAKER_01]: Next, let's switch to the topic of some
municipal initiatives, and in this case,
[SPEAKER_01]: one that's been stalled temporarily,
but we think only temporarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt Abel is going to talk about an
initiative in Detroit, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt is a very active member, in fact,
a life member of the normal legal
[SPEAKER_01]: committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: He founded Cannabis Council, a practice
entirely consistent of cannabis cases and
[SPEAKER_01]: clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more importantly, what I've seen over
the last few years, a year or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: since, I guess about a year now since
Michigan's had that new initiative,
[SPEAKER_01]: is Matt is truly the go-to guy on these
important questions in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, instead of having him talk
about the medical use law today,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like for him to talk about what's
going on with that initiative that we
[SPEAKER_01]: expected to be on the ballot this November
in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Keith, and happy normal,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lawyer in Detroit, and there are
some activists in Detroit who approached
[SPEAKER_00]: me and said they wanted to do something
further to try to decriminalize marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: or move the ball even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Beck is the person who actually put
the language together and then had the
[SPEAKER_00]: petitions printed, came to me and someone
else and asked for funding, and three of
[SPEAKER_00]: us just kicked in a little bit to print it
and to pay some circulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even need 1,000 signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if initiative is available to you in
your state or your municipality or your
[SPEAKER_00]: county, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at the city charter,
the county charter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is available, there are all kinds
of ways that we can do this on a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: level to make inroads, and that's what we
were trying to do in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Detroit city charter allows citizen
initiative, and it didn't require a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we printed some petitions that said,
this would amend the Detroit city code to
[SPEAKER_00]: exempt adults possessing or using
marijuana on private property by amending
[SPEAKER_00]: the code section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to add this section, none of the
provisions of this article shall apply to
[SPEAKER_00]: the use or possession of less than one
ounce of marijuana on private property by
[SPEAKER_00]: a person who has attained the age of 21
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we reprinted the entire
controlled substance ordinances in the
[SPEAKER_00]: city of Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just added that section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it requires you to put all the language
there that might be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So better safe than sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we printed them once,
and there was some small heading that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't in bold, and it was completely
reprinted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cost a couple hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important to have the details
right, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, anyway, what happened was we
circulated the petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We paid petitioners a dollar a signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were filed with the county
clerk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, with the city clerk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were filed with the city clerk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city clerk counted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had sufficient signatures under
the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was submitted to the election
commission to set the language to go on
[SPEAKER_00]: the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tim and I appeared at the election
commission hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of considering language,
the corporation council, one of the three
[SPEAKER_00]: members of this commission, said,
we can't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I move that it be denied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just can this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they had written a legal opinion,
which we only found that day and obtained
[SPEAKER_00]: a copy of it, saying that they felt it was
illegal for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it was preempted by federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it was advisory only in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And neither of those is true or accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sued them, is what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a copy of the lawsuit that I filed
in Wayne County in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got an order to show cause against
the city clerk and the election
[SPEAKER_00]: commission, the head of the city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we appeared at the hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the mandamus hearing, the judge
said, this violates the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to order that it be
placed on the ballot and basically make me
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timing is such that the ballots are
being printed already now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the politics are such that while the
court of appeals, our next step,
[SPEAKER_00]: might, if they want to, hear a case in
three or four days, it typically takes
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly a year and a half from the date
all the briefs have been filed and are
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in the court before they hear the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at that, what we've decided to
do is we're filing a motion for rehearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In front of this judge explaining a little
more how he's wrong because he didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really hear us out all that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had his mind made up and we'd like to
show him what a stupid decision that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a legal term.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to show him some other things
that I didn't have and didn't think were
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a copy of the Detroit medical
marijuana law that was passed in 2004,
[SPEAKER_00]: four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was before our state law,
which was put on the ballot and wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: preempted and wasn't advisory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked me how, you know,
what actual effect it would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it not advisory?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, you know, an officer
wouldn't be able to write a ticket under
[SPEAKER_00]: city code that he can write today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a big practical
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he made up some crazy analogies
that were not on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I explained that to him and he said,
good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, we are going to be filing a
motion for rehearing in front of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we expect it'll be denied,
but our brief will be much thicker and
[SPEAKER_00]: more professional, ready to go to the
court of appeals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of thought it was a lay down,
but it was all over before we got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we go to the court of appeals,
we'll have all the legal arguments already
[SPEAKER_00]: laid out in the lower court, which is a
better way for us to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the timing is such that it looks like
if and when we win this, it'll probably be
[SPEAKER_00]: either a special election, which will be
rather interesting, or it could be even
[SPEAKER_00]: two years from now in the 2012 elections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are slowed, but not deterred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I thought that, first of
all, I thought there was no way we were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so confident when I went to court,
although I never get overconfident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never say it's a done deal, but I felt
very good about the case, because the law
[SPEAKER_00]: really is very strongly on our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we lost, I was surprised that I
wasn't depressed or dejected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was invigorated by more of the injustice
that's still coming from the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that had the reverse effect that I
expected, but it was a good thing for all
[SPEAKER_00]: of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm reinvigorated, and I'm willing and
ready to press on forward in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're gone, but not forgotten,
or we're forgotten now, but not gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back, put it that way,
one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
