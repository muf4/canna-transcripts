[SPEAKER_00]: There's me, there's the other me,
there's another me, and then there are the
[SPEAKER_00]: more me's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got a domino to play,
so we've been trying to work it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how your life went,
or what all that means, but me and the
[SPEAKER_00]: me's, we're not going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already seen what we couldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any skeletons in our closets, or our own
private stash of bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no screen like the next screen,
renewing the past, the present into
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing, while eternity is now not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's divided into what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's love that loves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's love that fears.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's love that possesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's love that needs proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the love that likes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no forgetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some reality's destiny threw at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fate wasn't much help, for this way of
loading the load, that we didn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: say, but it was up to us to carry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the land where the lies king,
pretending, pretending isn't pretending,
[SPEAKER_00]: using fear like glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least one of the me's have seen it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each and every one of us wants the glory,
but not a one of us likes the way we fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straying is a way of walking, when staying
isn't an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've been accused of some things
we did, and didn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we urge, I forgive you, me's that lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and the me's are looking for a me that
will answer to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, there is no one who will.
There
is no one who will.
There is no one who will.
There is no one who will.
