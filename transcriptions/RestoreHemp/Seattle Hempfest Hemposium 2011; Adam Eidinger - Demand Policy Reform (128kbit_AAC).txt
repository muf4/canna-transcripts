[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to thank everyone who stuck
around for our presentation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot to come out all the way
from Washington DC and speak to all the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempsters here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody here is a Hempster who came to
the Seattle Hemp Fest this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be working 24-7 in the
hemp industry to be a Hempster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just, you can become a member of
Vote Hemp and the Hemp Industry
[SPEAKER_00]: Association as a supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, and that's one of the ways the
industry has grown is through grassroots
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just I want to remind everyone once
again, it's been said a couple of times,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we, I really think we are the most
powerful movement in America right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't act like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to start acting like it and
demanding change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any politician who blows you off when
it comes to cannabis reform, you just have
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell them, I'm not going away,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go away if you don't act
on this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, let's keep fighting together
and let's stay united and, and thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: again for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Words of wisdom from Adam, never,
ever, ever vote for someone who considers
[SPEAKER_01]: you a criminal for a nonviolent offense.
