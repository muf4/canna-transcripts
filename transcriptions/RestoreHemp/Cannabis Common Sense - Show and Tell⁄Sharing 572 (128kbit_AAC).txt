[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a cannabis indica, powdered
cannabis indica on the back of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says one ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was powdered hashish from the Merrill
Company in Cincinnati and it says poison
[SPEAKER_00]: up here at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these medicines say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people believed it was a poison,
but this was an ounce of powdered hashish
[SPEAKER_00]: or keif and it was both Park Davis and Eli
Lilly had some products like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we have cannabis tincture number
17.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's physiologically tested and it's from
Park Davis and there's a little pd on
[SPEAKER_00]: embossed on the bottom of the bottle
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next door we have a cork that's kind of
broke off and residue in this bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it says it is poison right
there and this is cannabis fluid extract
[SPEAKER_00]: number 96 from Eli Lilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where this one is tincture number 17,
this is fluid extract number 96 and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't really tell you right off the top of
my head what the differences between those
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is one of the rarest things that
I've run across.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from the Allaire Woodward Company of
Peoria, Illinois and it is still full.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a package of cannabis and I don't
know exactly what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to try to open it,
but it's about 90 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the properties are a nervine,
it will cure your nerves, anodyne,
[SPEAKER_00]: knock you out, a pseudorythic and
anti-spasmodic and anti-epileptic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the things that we are
currently allowed to use medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: for, they were using it for back then in
1910.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom the common names are foreign
indian hemp, hashish, halish, gallow
[SPEAKER_00]: grass, bong, gunja, churus, and one other,
hemp, hemp from the German.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pretty rare package here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a package from the San
Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the way they packaged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like this was five grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very bright, bleak colored package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says warning may cause drowsiness,
dry mouth, mild euphoria, and short-term
[SPEAKER_00]: memory loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not drive or operate heavy machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's printed by the Purple Tree Trading
Company and the price was $60 for an
[SPEAKER_00]: eighth back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's grade California green 5A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to that we have a full bottle,
very rare thing from the Adamson Drug
[SPEAKER_00]: Company of Clarenburg, West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your improved cough and cold
compound, a valuable expectorant and
[SPEAKER_00]: sedative for coughs, colds, and simple
ailments of the throat, chest,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compound is valuable and in the
treatments of coughs, colds, simple
[SPEAKER_00]: bronchitis, and spasmodic croup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says an unusually effective cough
and cold preparation contains a specially
[SPEAKER_00]: selected remedial ingredients of rare
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something I've been holding on
to for a number of years and some
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate preparations that were quite
popular back about six or seven years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: before the feds came in and shut them
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Dragon Bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's chocolate almond dates with medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is called Uno Dos and it's a
medicinal chocolate caramel bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say I probably would have a
weakness for chocolate caramel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm probably carrying a good
number of pounds of chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I love the name of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Hashi's Bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medicinal chocolate almond bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next over, we have a deodorant purchased
at a local health food store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hemp oil deodorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made with the seeds of the marijuana
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to distinguish the THC
content, but it is from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least, another one
of my old products from back when I sold
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp paper from 1990 through 1997,
tree-free eco paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 50% hemp and 50% straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imported about 60 tons of this in
three containers back in 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it, hemp paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also mixed with cereal straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the end of our sharing segment
for tonight.
