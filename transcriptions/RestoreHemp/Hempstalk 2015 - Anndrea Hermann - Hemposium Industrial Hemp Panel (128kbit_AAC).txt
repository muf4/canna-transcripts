[SPEAKER_00]: The Hemp Industries Association,
we are the national non-profit here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've just had our 22nd annual
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 22 years at an association
fighting for the rights of industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: in this country and also facilitating the
rights of so many others as was reiterated
[SPEAKER_00]: in the panel before saying that the rest
of the world is really looking to what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening with cannabis movement and
legislation via what's happening in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully as a hemp industry we have our
international partners to really help us
[SPEAKER_00]: take this sector to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at something like building
material this is from Chris's booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a block he made at Hemp
Technologies which is my principal and the
[SPEAKER_00]: company that we are members of the HIA
which as I said is a national non-profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a burn test he did on a block he
made in one of our workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine how long was this here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one minute burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine your house would have
ended up going up in flames if this was to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for instance of one of the
materials there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am based in Manitoba, Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am from Joplin, Missouri where I've just
completed my 15th season of sampling for
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemp regulation based on THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something also that we are looking
and fighting for the change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: arbitrary THC level in the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada it's also 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the EU it's 0.2% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that we have a
derivative testing requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that all the hemp foods that
come from Canada into this country have
[SPEAKER_00]: also been tested for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's at 10 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're saying since 1998 we have been
sending healthy hemp foods into this
[SPEAKER_00]: country from plants that have been 0.3%
THC and nobody has ever failed a workplace
[SPEAKER_00]: drug test from consuming hemp foods from
plants that are 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know we have that level of efficacy
to move forward to help shift the change
[SPEAKER_00]: in the THC requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately right now, fortunately we do
have the bills in Congress and the Senate
[SPEAKER_00]: and the House of Representatives to
legalize industrial hemp but that is
[SPEAKER_00]: written to 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to make this change it's
something also that we've got to really
[SPEAKER_00]: consider what we've got to change in our
federal legislation right now to help
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Australia the percentage is 1% THC and
that's because it falls under something
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Poisons Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not anything to do with outside of
really just a THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we do have around 27-28 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have changed on Friday for all I
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 states that have legalized the
cultivation of industrial hemp in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States in accordance with section
7606 of the Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year we had 8 states cultivating
industrial hemp underneath that Farm Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing farmers back to the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I can say is we have
seen a lot of youth farmers coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really empowering coming from
working with farmers in Canada and now
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing the shift of people in their 30s
and 40s and even younger getting excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about staying on the family farm because
they have the hope and opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate cannabis and industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
