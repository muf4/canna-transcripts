[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Mexico from Monday, CBD is legal in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big turnaround.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some people call it a war.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been very crazy, the situation,
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thanks to all the movement that's
happened, I guess, worldwide, the
[SPEAKER_00]: advancements in CBD, industrial hemp,
Mexico now, as of Monday, will have legal
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will probably put an end to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This drug war that we've been seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we're starting to work with
hempcrete in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of this is building in
Mexico is actually quite cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though now we have to import the
material from Europe, the costs of this
[SPEAKER_00]: are dramatically low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can provide houses for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of our return to nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp can provide us a lot of solutions,
and housing is one of our basic
[SPEAKER_00]: necessities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to nature, not only hemp can
provide us that, but there's other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: like bamboo, there's coconuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start utilizing these plants,
we can start seeing solutions that
[SPEAKER_00]: basically to bring up more culture,
more education, more infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_00]: this will stop all this violence that
we're starting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess from all this, we've always been
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty much the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while, I guess, there was that bad
weed, but nowadays we have very good
[SPEAKER_00]: growers in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much underground still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot be very public.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good thing is that in Mexico,
laws are just suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have these very harsh
penalties for if they catch you with 60
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, if you cannot pay the cops,
you cannot get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going, I guess, the underground
route, but nowadays you see small
[SPEAKER_00]: associations popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that are growing for
people are making RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through this, CBD now is legal because I
guess through the law structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can defend yourself for a
constitutional right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's against your constitution or your
human right to deny you your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a little girl that she has 400
epileptic attacks a day, very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte, a judge just allowed her the
permit to legally import CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we were saying, on Monday,
medicinal marijuana is legal in Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the doorway to start getting
more people on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what's happening in Chile,
the whole movement of grow your own
[SPEAKER_00]: autocultivo is becoming very big because
if you're going to grow your own medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow your own food, grow your own beer,
grow your own house, grow your own energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow your own everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, liberate yourself from all this
that's holding us down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess we get into cannabis because
in Mexico, we've always been marihuanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been our culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And half of my family comes from Mexico,
but the other half comes from St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were always, I guess,
survivors.
[SPEAKER_00]: People call them slaves, but we call them
survivors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always use the medicine to heal
themselves for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that, we've always been exposed to
cannabis and to some really, really good
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor cannabis, some plants that reach
five meters of just beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as big as body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from that, we learned a lot about the
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been in our culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our grandmothers use it for arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, in my family, a lot of
people have died from cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never really had this safe access
because you always have to literally risk
[SPEAKER_00]: your life to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've lost a lot of friends along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is that this is our freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only hemp cannabis, bamboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, go back to nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where everything comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through that, we try to help people
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try and help people with medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you guys need, come to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as bad as it sounds on the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give us a call, and we'll have a
great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool, very cool.
