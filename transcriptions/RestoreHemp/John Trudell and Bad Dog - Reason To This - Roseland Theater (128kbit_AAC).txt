[SPEAKER_00]: Last night, in a dream, I interrogated
God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it the good die young?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the reason to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked, we argued, we cried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never did get any answers, but God knows
I tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answers already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is it took the creation story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Claimed it and took it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glorifying obedience and fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rampaging through the mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stamping uncertainty into the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's that original sin and
something about the devil to pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that golden rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do unto others, obviously isn't really a
rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The violence gets violenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And God just sits there with nothing to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read it said, in the beginning was
the word, and the word was God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never read it said, in the beginning
was thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thought is to think what that has
to do with anything.
