[SPEAKER_00]: I am here today to talk about Sensible
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you know that I've been defending
medical marijuana patients for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's my utter frustration at the
continuing abuse of medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and the people that care about
them and the voters will and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that has led me to form with
some other people sensiblewashington.org
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sensible Washington put an initiative
out earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked very hard to get it on the
ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some problems, there were some
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not able to get it on the ballot
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have relaunched at HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to put this on the ballot in
2011 and I think we are going to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have worked with the Senator on medical
marijuana issues for a number of years and
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing but respect for Senator
Colwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's done some of the finest work on
behalf of medical marijuana patients of
[SPEAKER_00]: any politician in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: She continues to be one of the few
politicians that actually listens to voter
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns and is in politics for the right
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just briefly address a couple
of issues about the initiative,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it will be next year,
11, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the Senator has brought up the
issue of regulation and I know the Senator
[SPEAKER_00]: is also talking about 2011 versus 2012 and
I want to tell you why regulation is not
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the initiative and won't be part
of the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue of putting regulation in an
initiative is a complex one and you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: get regulation into an initiative without
risking federal preemption.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I have approached ending marijuana
prohibition is not unique and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly new.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I went back and I researched how
we got rid of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a history major in college and I
went back and I started digging and what I
[SPEAKER_00]: found out was that prohibition was largely
repealed by citizens and it was repealed
[SPEAKER_00]: by citizens' initiatives and it was
repealed by citizens' committees that
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed legislation because politicians
didn't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, it was repealed legislatively
about 10 years before the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole approach, it gave me a
template, it gave me a way to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: legal at getting marijuana prohibition
ended and it gave me a way of looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the framework legally that would allow us
to do it and have it be what I call real
[SPEAKER_00]: reform and not policy-driven reform that
can change from administration to
[SPEAKER_00]: administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want that and I would never ask
anybody to waste their time and their
[SPEAKER_00]: precious labor and risk their life to go
out and work on something that wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way our initiative is set up it's
identical to the way initiatives were set
[SPEAKER_00]: up that removed prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it does is an issue of state law,
it removes all civil and criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: penalties for adult use of marijuana in
any way, agriculturally, medically,
[SPEAKER_00]: recreationally, construction, whatever it
is, it just removes all the criminal and
[SPEAKER_00]: civil penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not regulate, it doesn't do
anything else, it simply removes those
[SPEAKER_00]: penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what you have to do if you want to
get rid of marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: First you remove the penalties,
then the legislature can go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate and when the federal government
comes to say we don't like your
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations because they're in a law
passed by a legislature, the
[SPEAKER_00]: constitutional doctrine, a constitutional
doctrine called commandeering doctrine
[SPEAKER_00]: allows the state to defend its regulations
in court and overcome preemption.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the best hope we have of ending
marijuana prohibition and it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: template that the rest of the states need
to use to get rid of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is defensible against the federal
government in a way that nothing else is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pass the regulations and an
initiative they can be struck down and so
[SPEAKER_00]: can the subsequent law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of legal theory,
it's a little bit of constitutional law,
[SPEAKER_00]: but unfortunately we've got to grasp it
and understand it if we want to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: real reform and get rid of these unjust
goddamn marijuana laws that are crippling
[SPEAKER_00]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real issues surrounding marijuana as
well are issues related to industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's critically important for people in
the medical marijuana movement and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana movement to realize
that we have a whole bunch of allies with
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp is the economic giant that
we are talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently, for every hemp product
that you are buying in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: every single one of those hemp products,
whether it's food, whether it's the new
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp Crete, whether it's clothing or paper
or lotions or whatever, anything that you
[SPEAKER_00]: buy that is made out of hemp the hemp has
to be imported.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is imported from China, it is imported
from Eastern Europe, it is imported from
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the three countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we penalizing the best farmers in
the world, people in this state that can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow fields of marijuana in Eastern
Washington?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we penalizing our farmers and
supporting foreign economies?
[SPEAKER_00]: How in the fuck does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sense at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: None.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is none there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about regulation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not overly concerned about cannabis
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mason, Vert, and Safer have done a lot of
work, Brian's pals, comrades in arms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mine too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done a lot of work to show people
marijuana is one of the safest things on
[SPEAKER_00]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no lethal dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants aren't gonna get together and
attack us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing dangerous about
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be an over the counter,
openly sold remedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing dangerous about it at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing dangerous about it is the
power it has to make people act crazy and
[SPEAKER_00]: do stupid things like lock other people
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at any rate, the industrial hemp issue
and the medical issue and the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: issue are all covered by the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get this initiative passed,
2011 or 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that are working with me and
the commitment that they have is what is
[SPEAKER_00]: driving me and is driving the
organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a grassroots organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like Don Skakier sitting here,
people like Andrew Johnson sitting here
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been working and pouring their
lifeblood into this thing, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: basically told me, look, asshole,
if you don't run it, we're running it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, okay, let's go again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are running again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna run every year until we get
this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to worry about 2011 or
2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are pollsters that have talked to me
that are telling me 2011's better because
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll actually drive the turnout and
people will actually come out to vote for
[SPEAKER_00]: us when they don't come out to vote for
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something I tried to get across
to the Democratic Party this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: but alas, I got it across to them a little
too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did have a whole bunch of people
endorse us, including Jeannie's Republican
[SPEAKER_00]: co-partner in crime, Toby Nixon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Norm Stamper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all sorts of organizations
behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Democratic Party, the State Democratic
Party, endorsed us at their convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please help us out, sensiblewashington
.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
