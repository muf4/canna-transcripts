[SPEAKER_00]: We're watching where people understand
that the insane policy of forcing a state
[SPEAKER_00]: legal marijuana business to be conducted
on an all cash basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually I have, thank you for reminding
everybody how old I am, I've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: on this issue for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never met a human being regardless
of how they feel about whether marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: should be legal or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never met one person who feels that
there's any rationale to force it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted on an all cash basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gaining support, we have
bipartisan support for legislation to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with fixing that item.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 280E, I met with several hundred tax
practitioners this morning, several of
[SPEAKER_00]: whom were really concerned that,
again, state legal marijuana businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot fully conduct their business
expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have an effective tax rate that's
two, three, four times what a typical
[SPEAKER_00]: business would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I introduced that legislation at
my press conference was Grover Norquist,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Republican no tax pledge guy who
convenes all the conservative activists in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Grover was there sort of indicating
that this is not partisan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think is going to happen since we
have eight states voting, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there again last Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to Arizona this week where it's
ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical marijuana will pass in Florida,
I predict, with at least a 70% yes vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though it's just medical,
Florida will become the second largest
[SPEAKER_00]: legal marijuana market in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you are seeing is the momentum
that is building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people who have been supportive
of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be a tipping point
where over 270 million people will be in
[SPEAKER_00]: states where some form of marijuana
business is legal at the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the dam's going to break and
we're going to get an opportunity for the
[SPEAKER_00]: banking to be taken care of, the 280B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately I think we're going to also
have the dam break as it relates to
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a little loosen with DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bipartisan support for a piece of
legislation that would really enable
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana research to be conducted with
the same sort of provisions and safeguards
[SPEAKER_00]: as other controlled substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which now it's more stringent for
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're watching this year with
those election results in less than three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, changing the dynamics on the ground
with the momentum that we've built.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's all going to turn in the next
Congress.
