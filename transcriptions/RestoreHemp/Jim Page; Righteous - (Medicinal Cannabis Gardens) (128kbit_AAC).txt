locked in a cardboard box and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a look With sidetracked frills and
fantasies all written all over the book
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody tells you what to think and
they've got their reasons why You gotta
[SPEAKER_01]: pick reality up by the scruff of the neck
and look it right in the eye And isn't

lamppost They talk about what it does to
[SPEAKER_01]: your brain Well I just have to react Cause

[SPEAKER_01]: Righteous is good enough for me George
Washington was the father of our country
[SPEAKER_01]: and he had a hemp plantation Betsy Ross
used it to make the flag that flew above
[SPEAKER_01]: the baby nation They wrote their
declarations on paper from that same hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber press And I don't know what they
spoke when they were taking a break But I
[SPEAKER_01]: got a pretty good guess Isn't that
righteous?

know why some people get so upset when you
[SPEAKER_01]: say to legalize it They'd rather build
more jails arrest more people and spread
[SPEAKER_01]: more crazy lies It's like talking to a
brick wall You know they just don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: the facts I think they ought to try a
little of that Betsy Ross It just might
[SPEAKER_01]: help them relax Isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_01]: And isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ain't that the way it ought to be?
