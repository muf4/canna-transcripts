[SPEAKER_03]: You know, being Seattle Hempfest and being
the largest most sophisticated cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: policy reform event in the world,
we try to make things up to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're gonna do a countdown for
the 420 here and all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, I tell you, we felt so bad
about the fact that tonight couldn't be
[SPEAKER_03]: here that we decided to do something about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, there's been this rumor
floating around that I'm gonna address it
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta tell you people that I decided to
quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized, hey, I'm not a
quitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna thank some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I wanna thank all the
vendors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna thank the Seattle Hempfest for
having me out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna thank all these volunteers who
worked so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of volunteers around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna thank the police for keeping the
peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna thank some people who don't get a
lot of credit and really deserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna thank those people walking around
here selling magic cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was appropriate to start here
in Seattle because it's the home of the
[SPEAKER_01]: place where the young and the young of
heart took to the streets and flashed a
[SPEAKER_01]: giant neon sign saying, we're not putting
up with this shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because there's an amazing propaganda
machine in this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a propaganda machine that
makes us actually believe that we live in
[SPEAKER_01]: a democracy when we know we don't live in
a democracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's propaganda machine that talks
about us living in a free country when we
[SPEAKER_01]: know we're not living in a free country.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're free to do whatever you wanna do as
long as it doesn't go against what the
[SPEAKER_01]: government wants you to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we gonna turn that around?
[SPEAKER_01]: I say things like this, the Seattle Hint
Fest, are the way to turn this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of you people who showed up here
today, you're making a statement,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm damn proud of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what I have to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for coming out here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love you, my heart.
