[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for taking time for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight on our show we have a very unusual
and a unique guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unusual in the sense that he has spent a
lifetime defending the sanctuary of the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual and trying to bring about the
importance that government stays out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual's life and the individual
is allowed to make their own choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brent is a futurist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's able to foresee farther down the road
than many of his contemporaries and tries
[SPEAKER_00]: his best to bring forth his knowledge and
his insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please welcome on our show, Dr. Timothy
Leary.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Casper, it's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I approve very highly of your program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand it's growing nationwide now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many cities are you in now?
[SPEAKER_00]: At present we're in 80 cities and in 44
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh boy, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting the word out like this is very
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've always been known as the
highest rider of every generational wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: The what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest rider of every generational
wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been the forefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been there from World War II to the
early 60s, the 70s, able to speak the
[SPEAKER_00]: voice and be heard and foresee it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realizing this, how do you think the wave
of the hemp movement is going to settle
[SPEAKER_00]: into the population and break upon the
shores of our ecology problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Break upon the shores of our ecology
problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see oceans of green hemp doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The present laws against hemp I think are
the most irrational and I would say almost
[SPEAKER_01]: insane pieces of puritanic legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You maybe have to go back to the Salem
witchcraft trials to get something where
[SPEAKER_01]: so much hysteria has picked out something
so benign and so harmless and so
[SPEAKER_01]: profitable and so productive and had this
all out moral, fierce, religious campaign
[SPEAKER_01]: against hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think that there is this
religious fundamentalist and police
[SPEAKER_01]: government prejudice against hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you explain it?
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal views, I feel that it stems
from a lot of the oil companies and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who can make money off of being
illegal, keeping it illegal and together
[SPEAKER_00]: put together a propaganda campaign to
mislead the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel that it will set into the
people's mind eventually when the truth is
[SPEAKER_00]: more exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I understand that we're not going to
talk about the religious or the emotional
[SPEAKER_01]: and psychological aspects of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't talk about that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about the practical
and the profitable and productive and
[SPEAKER_01]: ecological aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read books by Jack Herrera and I've
listened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, there are so many programs and so
many articles these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everywhere you turn around you hear
intelligent discussions about hemp as a
[SPEAKER_01]: substitute for oil, hemp as a substitute
for wood pulp, hemp as a source of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that I know most about,
however, is the puritanical crusade
[SPEAKER_01]: against hemp because I was in prison for
four and a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four under an ounce, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the possession of two roaches which
had been planted in my car by an overly
[SPEAKER_01]: generous policeman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at one point I found myself in prison
facing like 50 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 50 years at the time, 50 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a strange series of events for
such a harmless and even beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: situation to be charged with so much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you escaped from there too,
didn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I did what any sensible 50-year-old
would do if you're facing 50 years in
[SPEAKER_01]: prison for two roaches of marijuana that
they planted in your car.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only common sense thing to do is to
escape and I did that and made a few
[SPEAKER_01]: little B-movie adventures there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many things in our society that
have to be controlled and governed.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the way oil is polluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our atmosphere and acid rain and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guns should be controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think drugs like steroids should be
controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there should be probably more
control over alcohol and nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of all of the botanical, vegetable species
that the government is attacking,
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana is the one they're going after.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sometimes say that hemp is a democratic
plant because it was during the democratic
[SPEAKER_01]: regime of Jimmy Carter that hemp was
legalized in 14 states and Carter himself
[SPEAKER_01]: and his cabinet wanted to decriminalize
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 1980, you had the Republicans
coming in with a hard line, typical,
[SPEAKER_01]: crush them, down them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And suddenly the new drugs, which are
everywhere, are drugs that I never heard
[SPEAKER_01]: of back in the 60s and the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like crack and cocaine and
steroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I call them the Republican drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're Republican drugs.
Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Republicans, the hardliners,
like to feel tough and aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm number one and we're going to go
over there and we're going to kick butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to go out there and
loot a lot of savings and loans companies
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're going to go out there,
you've got to have a lot of energy and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a lot of self-confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to pick two up with cocaine or
a little steroids there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arnold Schwarzenegger, of course,
is the typical example of the steroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call him Conan the Republican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the one thing about the use of
hemp as a drug, I've had to warn
[SPEAKER_01]: Republicans about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a Republican, and you're a
hardliner, and you want to go out there
[SPEAKER_01]: and kick and stretch and get yourself to
the top, and if you're in the army or the
[SPEAKER_01]: police or anything, you want to have to be
tough and mean and stay away from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because hemp will turn you into a wimp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at Carter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was believing in peace and love.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the wrong things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All the terrible things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the government is spending much
more money crushing the production of
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that puzzles me about the
insanity or even the diabolical nature of
[SPEAKER_01]: the right-wing religious Republican
situation, why did they go after the
[SPEAKER_01]: American farmers?
[SPEAKER_01]: They spend more money fighting hemp in
this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in California, which is my home
state, hemp was the number one
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural cash product.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Iowa, in Tennessee, like... Back in
Indiana, where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, how many states?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that we're aware of, 28 or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, honest farmers out there trying to
make a living out of growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the government is out there arresting
these good-hearted, free enterprise
[SPEAKER_01]: farming agricultural Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, down in Colombia and Peru,
these gangsters, the cocaine cartel
[SPEAKER_01]: people, are making billions of dollars,
and we're spending less money on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, how come?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're probably right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want people to be using hemp
because it would interfere with the oil
[SPEAKER_01]: monopoly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would interfere with the wood pulp
monopoly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I think there's something really
religiously diabolic and evil about the
[SPEAKER_01]: right-wing Christians in this country who
go after hemp because they hate people to
[SPEAKER_01]: have pro-choice and to make your own
decisions about your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be some of the people,
too, who overlook the medical aspects of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, from your perspective in being a
psychiatrist, as you are, you've had the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to become acquainted with many
different aspects of healing and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the more positive benefits of the uses of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you share that, please?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there have been an enormous number
of studies that show that hemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis were extremely necessary for
certain forms of black coma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You simply have to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many states, these fanatic,
anti-pleasure people are so afraid that
[SPEAKER_01]: the patient who's going blind might enjoy
the experience that you've got to go blind
[SPEAKER_01]: if you die but don't have a good time
because Republicans are in power.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's apparently the logic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they using it, too, for anorexia and
for cancer, AIDS?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's one terrible thing about
hemp, and I don't want to get into the use
[SPEAKER_01]: of marijuana, but I've got to be honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some terrible side effects of
smoking or using marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, it's called refrigerator blackout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you get the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, suddenly you smoke a joint,
and suddenly there you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing you know, you've eaten nine
pounds of fig newtons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be careful there.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, if you're dying of
cancer or malnourished because of stomach
[SPEAKER_01]: problems and you don't have any appetite,
hemp, of course, is the logical and
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious and natural medicine to give you
an appetite to see you through that
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, a good true Puritan would
rather have you die than have a good meal
[SPEAKER_01]: while you're giggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that it's good for stress to
calm you down, and from a viewpoint of a
[SPEAKER_00]: psychiatrist, is there any benefits for
someone who might be having emotional or
[SPEAKER_00]: mental problems as opposed to giving them
like Valiums or some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger drugs that seem to be causing
problems like Prozac and so on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, number one, I don't want to come out
like a smart ass here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every psychological situation is
individual and needs its own pharmacology,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I want to generalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly, the things about hemp is
it's not addictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have any of the side effects of
any of the euphorics and the
[SPEAKER_01]: antidepressants that are approved and that
doctors prescriptions will give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, the thing about religious
fanaticism is that the crazier,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nuttier, the wilder, and almost the
more nonsensical the belief, the more you
[SPEAKER_01]: hang onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've debated for many years a man who was
the head of the DEA for about five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Peter Bensinger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't believe him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going after hemp, and he's trying to
say that, oh, hemp, they gave a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: some mice some hemp, and it made male
mice, teenage male mice, and it made their
[SPEAKER_01]: breasts grow a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's saying, college boys, he's even
going, why is he going?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are real problems of cracked babies
in the inner city and alcohol,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is our number one drug here,
and nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half a million people die here from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's this guy lathering on about the
dangers of, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never even mentioned whether marijuana
would make girls' breasts bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't even want to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing is so sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now you've also had a few debates with
G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gordon Liddy, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he seems to think that marijuana,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, is one of the plants that's going to
lead to a complete social breakdown in our
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know Gordon Liddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been debating him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known him for years, over 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know exactly how his mind works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a good army man, like a good military
man, like a good policeman, like a good
[SPEAKER_01]: follower of his leader, Richard Nixon.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gordon Liddy has never had one
unauthorized thought in his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he reads the lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he knows that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: LSD makes you jump out of windows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana makes you, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say it's the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I must say here, and I don't want to
offend anyone, and if you're a deeply
[SPEAKER_01]: devout Christian, I want you to turn your
TV off now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel that there's a great problem in
this country in a violation of our civil
[SPEAKER_01]: liberties and personal rights on the basis
of the federal government interfering with
[SPEAKER_01]: women's bodies about abortion and the
insane war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The war on drugs is a war on Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a war on Russians or evil
communists and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a war against 40 or 50 million of us
marijuana smokers in this country,
[SPEAKER_01]: which in a way seems like a weird thing
that the majority in Congress should
[SPEAKER_01]: suddenly declare war on 30 million
otherwise tax paying reasonably productive
[SPEAKER_01]: American citizens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the basis is religion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basis is that you're not allowed to
choose what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like any fanatic religious,
they'll tell you you can't use
[SPEAKER_01]: contraceptives because you can't enjoy
sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do conceive a baby,
you have no choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no choice about whether you want
to bring this baby or you can handle this
[SPEAKER_01]: baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing is true about the
choice of your own self-medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I personally believe that the war on
drugs is the worst attack on American
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom that we've experienced in 200
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is the 200th anniversary of
the Bill of Rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in 1791 that they passed those 10
wonderful bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, what most people now realize is
that the Bill of Rights and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Constitution is designed to protect the
individual against the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the government can't come into your
house without a search warrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government can't put soldiers in your
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government can't force you to testify
against yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government can't tell you what to read
or write.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government can't tell you how to
worship your own god.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government can't tell you how to
really mind your own business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's both ironic and I think it's also
very hopeful that in the year 1991,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 200th anniversary of the Bill of
Rights, this hemp movement is growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to tell you, it is growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give a lot of talks to students in
colleges and the awareness of the insanity
[SPEAKER_01]: of the marijuana laws is becoming,
I think, more and more obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells us that perhaps we are finally
making an impact across the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: and perhaps around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are really enjoying this interview,
and we'll be right back after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Time for Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today on our show, we have the
distinguished Dr. Timothy Leary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timothy, I think you've been aware of some
of the changes in the laws here within the
[SPEAKER_00]: American structure of Congress and all the
way down to dogcatcher opinions from Nancy
[SPEAKER_00]: Reagan swaying our opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this say no?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a motto and a bumper sticker and a
t-shirt that says, just say K-N-O-W,
[SPEAKER_01]: no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think for yourself and don't believe what
Nancy Reagan says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't believe what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think for yourself and question authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because of this conservatism,
though, some of the laws that were
[SPEAKER_00]: established during the Carter
administration, such as decriminalization
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana, et cetera, are beginning to
go back to another era, back when mines
[SPEAKER_00]: were narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Alaska, they've changed the laws back
to stiffen the laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going through a period now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened in the 60s and 70s,
we had this country a classic renaissance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, read the history books.
[SPEAKER_01]: A renaissance is a period when there's a
sudden surge in self-expression in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rights of the individual, a loosening of
the control of authority, a questioning of
[SPEAKER_01]: a religious dogma, and then a lurch
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is always followed by a hard-line
retreat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that it's at the same time that there
has in the last 10 years in America under
[SPEAKER_01]: Reagan and Bush, and this very repressive
hard line, look what's happened to the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in Russia just three weeks ago,
when they had that coup, and then a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of young people in Moscow protected
Yeltsin and stopped the tanks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what it was that was stopping the
tanks?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was young Russians, students,
who were throwing flowers at the tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds familiar, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound familiar?
[SPEAKER_01]: They learned that, absolutely,
from the American in the 60s and 70s,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were questioning the authority of
Johnson and Nixon and stopping the Vietnam
[SPEAKER_01]: War.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that was amusing about the
Russian Revolution, and it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: connected with this, the three young men
who got shot by the tanks and were
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately promoted to the highest office
or honor of the Soviet Union, the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: order of the land, they were three
hippies.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was a grateful deadhead, and one like
heavy metal rock, and they let their hair
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, and they all had learned to smoke
hashish in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, they were trying to stop the
tanks, because it was their brothers and
[SPEAKER_01]: their friends and their colleagues who
were in the tanks, because it turned out
[SPEAKER_01]: that the Soviet soldiers that had been
sent to Afghanistan hated the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: going down there and killing Afghani
people for no apparent reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very proud of the fact that
although in America we've had this very
[SPEAKER_01]: predictable, but very violent and mean and
nasty puritanism, and you can't smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarettes, and they're censoring rock and
roll records, and they're censoring books.
[SPEAKER_01]: One by one, they're going down the list of
personal freedoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, the basic American
freedoms which we set going in the 60s are
[SPEAKER_01]: appearing in the Soviet Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ours are reversing, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the hemp issue could be one
of the last strong divides that we face as
[SPEAKER_00]: a body of people in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody seems to have an opinion,
everybody seems upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the hemp issue is a place
where you can draw the line, and anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: who's watching this program, in your city,
there's obviously a channel which is
[SPEAKER_01]: carrying this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in touch with the people that are
producing this show in your locality,
[SPEAKER_01]: and start embarrassing your local
politicians by asking them, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: of your congressmen and assemblymen and
women, how many of you smoked marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: when you were young, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that about 80% of the members of
Congress under the age of 50 were smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: How come they could do it, and we can't do
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's even been reported rumors that
people all the way up to the White House
[SPEAKER_00]: may have been involved with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: White House?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do know that Ronald Reagan smoked
marijuana, because that came out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: book by Kitty Kelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ronald Reagan was governor of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, when you think about it,
when you think about it, that explains
[SPEAKER_01]: everything about poor Ronnie Reagan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows you why Republicans should not
smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the amnesia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The forgetfulness.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short-term memory loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cheerful, hey, what's wrong,
baby, everything's fine, even though the
[SPEAKER_01]: country's going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The long naps after lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ronnie, come on, leave marijuana alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, both Ronnie's children,
Ron Jr. and Betty Davis, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: are kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point I'm making here about the place,
I think, to take a stand, abortion rights
[SPEAKER_01]: is just one place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But marijuana, the way to do it is through
humor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write letters to the editor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Challenge politicians as to whether they
really think that alcohol is more
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous than marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And on a very common sense, logical,
friendly, humorous approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've always been one for the wit and to
tickle people with a laugh and make them
[SPEAKER_00]: think, I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do what you can to stimulate the
mind in a fun way?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the aim of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's oftentimes why you've been
so misconstrued by your contemporaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't take a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one way to bring down any
repressive authoritarian regime is
[SPEAKER_01]: irreverence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pride myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have a very high IQ that is
irreverence quotient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have been leading the center in this
country during the Johnson administration,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Nixon administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud to have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud that Richard Nixon called me the
most dangerous man in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, after all, what an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to urge those of you who just
think for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hemp issue is a wonderful issue to
bring people together because it brings
[SPEAKER_01]: together ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings together a substitute for
petroleum, which, of course, is the real
[SPEAKER_01]: Republican addictive drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such an ecologically helpful
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Above all, it prevents us from cutting
down the Amazon rainforest for wood pulp
[SPEAKER_01]: or cutting down for fiber because we all
know that hemp is, by far, the best
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something that's very wonderful
about a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And human beings kind of rally behind a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those five wonderful leaves that kind of
represent wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the great thing about it is the right
wing Republicans and the right wing
[SPEAKER_01]: religious fanatics hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know why they hate it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it makes people feel free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes people feel free, feel funny,
and independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they hate it, it's got to be something
good about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would shoot myself if I didn't ask this
one last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so many people say, you had
Timothy Leary there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't you ask him in?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really started to shy away from
the recreational uses, so we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it a long response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you feel that when consumed as a
recreational plant, that it can bring you
[SPEAKER_00]: more in tune with your own being,
with your own self, maybe put things in a
[SPEAKER_00]: better perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it like liquor?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you drink it, you're just so out of
touch that you don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I spent 40 years scientifically
studying the various botanical vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: gifts that the plant queendom has given
the mammalian animal kingdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no question in my mind that
the mushrooms and marijuana are the
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest gifts given to us by the plant,
the kingdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can misuse marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three dangerous side effects of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is you kind of see too much,
and that makes you kind of a little a
[SPEAKER_01]: little spacey because you know you just do
see so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second is short-term memory loss,
like you forget what you were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third dangerous side effect,
I forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use marijuana if you're going to go to
school, if you're going to do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that requires attention, concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just absolutely stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana should be used for moments of
real celebration and of glorification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one thing about marijuana is it's
not a loner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that you do with somebody
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that someone would go off and
smoke marijuana by themselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like doing this talk show that
we've had the chance to do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you very much for being a
guest on our show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told by the people here on the
sides that we need to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell you, you've given us a lot of
food for our minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all behind your cause, and it's an
honor and pleasure to be with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks to the crew who did a great
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have you back on again
sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next time you see me, remember
that you'll know it's time for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please join in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get copies of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it off to governors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it off to senators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it off to people whose minds are
closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell your friends about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a victim of this war on drugs
and feel that bringing your story to us
[SPEAKER_00]: might enlighten it to the nation where we
can help make a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's people in your community who
need to be focused on, please let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a challenge regarding any
of our statements, remember Jack Harrah
[SPEAKER_00]: once said, $10,000 to anybody who comes
onto the show and disproves our findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Harrah stands behind that statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to have him on our show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'll look for you the next
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
