[SPEAKER_00]: Once that festival starts going,
I mean the sky could open up like it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts snowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're anywhere, there ain't nowhere but
here that we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With thy birth, a huge miracle machine,
you were the greatest drill that the world
[SPEAKER_00]: has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're stuck down in the mud,
bleeding money like it was blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you ain't going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they were gonna build a tunnel from
here to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what the cost, there was money
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they stuffed their brains down the
corporate disposal with their empty heads
[SPEAKER_00]: together, and they came up with a
proposal, and they were high-fiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were kicking it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all a bed of roses until something
went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with thy birth, a huge miracle
machine, you were the greatest drill that
[SPEAKER_00]: the world has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're stuck down in the mud,
bleeding money like it was blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you ain't going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Public relations and band-aid devices,
corporation lawyers raise the prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bankers have insurance, and the
loopholes are greased, and the bandits
[SPEAKER_00]: make their money, keep their pockets
creased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mayor and the council have egg on
their faces, but they'll just wipe it off
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it in some safer places.
[SPEAKER_00]: With thy birth, a huge miracle machine,
you were the greatest drill that the world
[SPEAKER_00]: has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're stuck down in the mud,
bleeding money like it was blood,
and you ain't going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got billion-dollar stadiums and
billion-dollar teams, billion-dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: billionaires selling billion-dollar coffee
beans, celebrity hip-hop who can wrap it
[SPEAKER_00]: up in style, shiny bright skyscrapers
you've been seeing for miles, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest and most famous that they all
talk about is how the drill bit got stuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now they'll never get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with thy birth, a huge miracle machine,
you were the greatest drill that the world
has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're stuck down in the mud,
bleeding money like it was blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you ain't going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's seal it up and leave it full of
history to find, as a testimonial to our
[SPEAKER_00]: disconnected state of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or let's dig it up and put it in the EMP,
as a science fiction laughing stock for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone to see, for the vanity and
insanity of the floated dollar bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the corporate elites who just have to
keep their coffers silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: With thy birth, a huge miracle machine,
you were the greatest drill that the world
[SPEAKER_00]: has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're stuck down in the mud,
bleeding money like it was blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you ain't going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your street's full of dumb ideas,
they happen all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's disaster is someone else's
bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everything that goes up, most of it
comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And half of every gold mine is just a hole
in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's right when things go
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's all get together and sing this
song.
[SPEAKER_00]: With thy birth, a huge miracle machine,
you were the greatest drill that the world
[SPEAKER_00]: has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're stuck down in the mud,
bleeding money like it was blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you ain't going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: With thy birth, a huge miracle machine,
you were the greatest drill that the world
[SPEAKER_00]: has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're stuck down in the mud,
bleeding money like it was blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you ain't going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: With thy birth, a huge miracle machine,
