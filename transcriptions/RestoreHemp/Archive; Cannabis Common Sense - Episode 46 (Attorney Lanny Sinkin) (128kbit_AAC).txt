[SPEAKER_00]: Video tape live at the studios of city
video It is time for cannabis common sense
[SPEAKER_00]: the show that tells you the truth about
marijuana and the politics behind its
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition Now here's the host of your
show Paul Stanford and Paul Loney Hello
[SPEAKER_01]: and welcome to another exciting edition of
cannabis common sense Our show is a
[SPEAKER_01]: production of our Oregon political
committee campaign for the restoration and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation of hip My name is Paul
Stanford, and I would like to introduce my
[SPEAKER_01]: co-host our attorney our Treasurer chief
petitioner and the president of the Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: Wildlife Federation Paul Loney Thanks,
Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am all the things and I'm also here to
tell you what our initiative is all about
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a Comprehensive system to regulate
cannabis Marijuana here in the state of
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon it would allow the sale of
marijuana to medical patients through
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacies at cost It would allow the sale
to adult over 21 of psychoactive marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: and state liquor stores Allow people to
grow it at home for their own personal use
[SPEAKER_02]: and allow our farmers to grow it You know
and for products it's the non psychoactive
[SPEAKER_02]: variety To take part in the world trade as
it as it were And tonight, we're real
[SPEAKER_02]: fortunate to have once again a special
guest an attorney all the way from Hawaii
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to live here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to live in Washington DC used to
live in Texas, but right now He's sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: on a couch next to me And this is Lanny
sinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to be here all right and
See you're here for on behalf of a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of cases that I'm involved with so but why
don't you tell us about the The CRH case
[SPEAKER_02]: the campaign restoration case as a nice
circuit likes to call it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a civil rights action brought in
Portland on behalf of three political
[SPEAKER_03]: organizations and one individual and it
stems from the city of Portland using
[SPEAKER_03]: public resources for partisan political
purposes the story begins when the
[SPEAKER_03]: campaign to pay for schools by regulating
cannabis and announced its petition drive
[SPEAKER_03]: to put an initiative on the ballot in
January of 1995 I guess exactly January 95
[SPEAKER_03]: and first effort at the on the same day
that they held their press conference
[SPEAKER_03]: announcing that the official spokesperson
for the Portland Police Department an
[SPEAKER_03]: officer named Jensen Appeared before the
television cameras to question the
[SPEAKER_03]: motivations of those who were sponsoring
this initiative And that act alone
[SPEAKER_03]: constitutes official opposition to
signature gathering Which is against state
[SPEAKER_03]: law in Oregon more importantly is an
unconstitutional use of public funds for
[SPEAKER_03]: partisan purposes the fourth amendment the
United States Constitution guarantees all
[SPEAKER_03]: citizens a Republican form of government
What that means is that while people may
[SPEAKER_03]: delegate their power to a government the
government cannot and operate partially on
[SPEAKER_03]: behalf of Any group within the society it
must be responsible to all the people
[SPEAKER_03]: where the power continues to reside So for
our government to use public resources in
[SPEAKER_03]: a partisan way to try and defeat one side
of a political issue is both illegal and
[SPEAKER_03]: unconstitutional and once officer Jensen
did come out publicly opposing the
[SPEAKER_03]: initiative Paul Stanford wrote to the
Mayor Mayor Katz at the time and still
[SPEAKER_03]: saying that this was an illegal act and
requesting the mayor to Tell the police
[SPEAKER_03]: not to do this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no response to that letter a
copy of that letter went to the chief of
[SPEAKER_03]: police.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Moose Mr. Stanford didn't wrote a Then
called the mayor's office to ask why there
[SPEAKER_03]: had been no response and the mayor's aide
said that there would be no response
[SPEAKER_03]: because the mayor Agreed with what the
police officer was doing disagreed with
[SPEAKER_03]: the initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that gave an official in premature an
official Okay to the eagle illegal use of
[SPEAKER_03]: public funds to campaign against the
gathering of signatures on this initiative
[SPEAKER_03]: and indeed prompted further police action
along the same lines two officers Tried to
[SPEAKER_03]: prevent the issuance of a permit for the
annual hemp festival Jeff and Susie
[SPEAKER_03]: Crawford are key organizers of that annual
event Jeff had applied for the permit for
[SPEAKER_03]: the event two police officers went to the
Parks Department And tried to convince the
[SPEAKER_03]: Parks Department not to issue the permit
Had the Parks Department not issued the
[SPEAKER_03]: permit it would have been a clearly
unconstitutional Act a clear civil rights
[SPEAKER_03]: violation for the hemp event sponsors a
denial of their civil rights Here you have
[SPEAKER_03]: two police officers paid in their official
position with the sanction of their
[SPEAKER_03]: supervising police officer Trying to
convince other public employees to act
[SPEAKER_03]: unconstitutionally to suppress an event at
which signatures were to be gathered on an
[SPEAKER_03]: initiative Again a violation of state law
a violation of constitutional principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two officers were named as well I
remember in that case once Jeff Crawford
[SPEAKER_01]: was saying that Complaining to the police
officer and said that something like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know This is a violation of our
constitutional rights and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: officers that's included in the suit
Responded that the Constitution doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: mean anything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the type of mentality we're
dealing with here And what the police
[SPEAKER_03]: officers did too was once the fortunately
the Parks Department simply would not go
[SPEAKER_03]: along with them and did issue the permit
as they should have Once that was done the
[SPEAKER_03]: police then organized their own counter
event and they wanted to put it right next
[SPEAKER_03]: to the hemp festival and the Parks
Department put it down the street Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was a counter event that included
bringing in seized vehicles helicopters
[SPEAKER_03]: Coast Guard boats all kinds of
intimidation to strike fear into the Those
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be attending the hemp festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust it was perceived by them more as
entertainment than a source of fear But it
[SPEAKER_03]: was designed to instill fear in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, we do face fear in our
campaign most I can't think of a single
[SPEAKER_01]: other political organization that has to
deal with supporters paranoia the way we
[SPEAKER_01]: do there are people who don't want to Call
us don't want to sign our petitions
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're afraid that the police are
going to come after them and having the
[SPEAKER_01]: police come out in the media this way just
reinforces that fear that Our organization
[SPEAKER_01]: has to deal with that no other political
group today that I know of has to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with I mean during the civil rights
Actions in the 60s the civil rights
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations had to deal with police
repression, but today I can't think of
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is an important point It's really
what the civil rights law was designed to
[SPEAKER_03]: prevent which was the use of public power
to suppress unpopular political movements
[SPEAKER_03]: And the case that we have brought is a
civil a case under the Civil Rights Act
[SPEAKER_03]: After the hemp event was held two other
officers one from the marijuana task force
[SPEAKER_03]: and one from the dare program were
approached by a reporter doing a story
[SPEAKER_03]: about the initiative and They gave
statements opposing the initiative and why
[SPEAKER_03]: they opposed the initiative again directly
contradictory to state law that forbids
[SPEAKER_03]: such activity by public employees For good
reason, you know law is based On the idea
[SPEAKER_03]: that the public government cannot use
public resources to fund one side of a
[SPEAKER_03]: political campaign the law does make a
distinction between statements of personal
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion and statements that are violations
of this law if a police officer working
[SPEAKER_03]: for the marijuana task force wants to sit
around his kitchen table and Tell his
[SPEAKER_03]: friends that he thinks that the initiative
is a terrible idea That's one thing when
[SPEAKER_03]: he's giving an interview to a member of
the press in his official position with
[SPEAKER_03]: his official identification on official
time paper In uniform in uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole nother thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we have here with the five
officers that have been named in the suit
[SPEAKER_03]: a very How should I put it biased judge
Now that we faced here in Portland threw
[SPEAKER_03]: the case out saying that there were no
federal claims identified in this case
[SPEAKER_03]: That we've taken up on appeal to the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals By the time this
[SPEAKER_03]: show is aired.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that appears You will have been
heard correct and we will be waiting for a
[SPEAKER_03]: decision part of the the rule under the
Civil Rights Act is for a municipality to
[SPEAKER_03]: be liable We have named the city of
Portland as the chief defendant in this
[SPEAKER_03]: case You must have a policy being
implemented and one of the one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Indicators that there is a policy is if
official policymakers ratify the actions
[SPEAKER_03]: that were violated of civil rights well
when mayor Katz said that she was not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to take any action regarding officer
Jensen's illegal statements to the press
[SPEAKER_03]: and in fact Supported those statements
because she opposed the initiative then
[SPEAKER_03]: mayor Katz made the city of Portland
liable for any damages that a jury would
[SPEAKER_03]: care to reward to the three organizations
or mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crawford who's also a plaintiff in this
instance and I should say that another
[SPEAKER_03]: piece of the puzzle is that we filed
complaints are actually Paul Stanford
[SPEAKER_03]: filed complaints with the state the state
Has to enforce the election laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those complaints were filed with the
state elections division asking that they
[SPEAKER_03]: penalize the police officers who were
violating state law and we did a dance
[SPEAKER_03]: with that state group that went on for
More than three years if I'm correct or
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere in the neighborhood of summer
two and a half years before we could ever
[SPEAKER_03]: get into Any kind of real response from
the state government that's supposed to be
[SPEAKER_03]: enforcing the state law But the state law
is quite clear that state employees
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly municipal employees are not
to engage in political activity funded by
[SPEAKER_03]: the Municipality and that that's a law
that's posted where they can all see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are all aware of it It was very
interesting in the newspaper interviews
[SPEAKER_03]: where the two officers came out opposed to
the initiative other state employees Said
[SPEAKER_03]: we are not allowed by law to comment
directly on an initiative They did comment
[SPEAKER_03]: on what effects the initiative might have
on the administration of their particular
[SPEAKER_03]: agency things like that perfectly
legitimate But the police were right up
[SPEAKER_03]: front one officer said I'm opposed to the
initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was his lead statement So we had a
whole series of violations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to the state government and asked
them to do something about it They
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to the municipal government asked
them to do something about it They
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we eventually had To go to the federal
courts and we will now wait and see what
[SPEAKER_03]: the federal court has to say about whether
the relief that's being sought Which is an
[SPEAKER_03]: injunction to prevent them from doing this
kind of thing while the new campaign is
[SPEAKER_03]: going on Will indeed be entered if it is
it'll be additional protection for people
[SPEAKER_03]: who are trying to gather the signatures
and Acknowledgement that people who are
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to gather the signatures are
entitled to the protection of the Civil
[SPEAKER_03]: Rights Act It would be very helpful in
that sense Just in the past year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the police The Portland police
marijuana task force agents Oppose us in
[SPEAKER_01]: in the media several times again,
so it's continued clear They're not
[SPEAKER_03]: getting the message right and we hope this
lawsuit will send that message and that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's also clear that when people are
afraid to participate in the political
[SPEAKER_03]: process we have a real problem and I hope
that people who want to support the
[SPEAKER_03]: initiative will not be afraid and the way
to get past the fear is to simply get past
[SPEAKER_03]: the Fear if enough people sign the
initiative if enough people circulate the
[SPEAKER_03]: initiative if enough people contribute
money Then they can't go out and go after
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody and the more we get people of
stature in the community I hope that
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody that's holding a political office
or is an acknowledged leader in the
[SPEAKER_03]: community who cares about democracy Will
sign these petitions to put this
[SPEAKER_03]: initiative on the ballot to give people a
chance to vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes or no It's not saying you favor the
change in the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really saying you favor people being
given The right to vote on this I hope
[SPEAKER_03]: that political leaders and community
leaders and people who are acknowledged in
[SPEAKER_03]: the community is having stature even by
the police Will sign this will contribute
[SPEAKER_03]: to it to give their the protection of
their participation To those that are on
[SPEAKER_03]: the cutting edge of political activity and
suffering from official repression for
[SPEAKER_02]: engaging in such activity Yeah,
I think it's a good time here to bring up
[SPEAKER_02]: our phone number again So our phone number
if you want to get involved like Lanny
[SPEAKER_02]: says everybody should be involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's area code 503 235 4606 that's 503 235
4606 and we can mail you the Petitions and
[SPEAKER_02]: we hope that you go out and get signatures
and even if you put your own signature on
[SPEAKER_02]: it That's that's that's great because we
need everybody's signature 72,000 valid
[SPEAKER_02]: signatures approximately what we need and
There's a lot of registered voters out
[SPEAKER_02]: there in Oregon and you among them,
so please call us up and Get our
[SPEAKER_02]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we need help as well in the office
and Paul we have a website Yeah on our
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch this TV show you can also
watch Hours of various video Footage we
[SPEAKER_01]: have the entire film reefer madness an
hour and a half Australian documentary
[SPEAKER_01]: called hemp revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at www.crrh.org Name of our political
committee is campaign for the restoration
[SPEAKER_01]: and regulation of him thus CRR H dot o RG
the dot o RG is what they give nonprofit
[SPEAKER_01]: political organizations such as our own So
I want to urge you you can even print our
[SPEAKER_01]: petitions from the net you can watch
literally dozens of hours of footage very
[SPEAKER_01]: educational footage On that website as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know I like to get back to a
point To me you think that most people the
[SPEAKER_02]: public if you go up and talk to them They
say you know can a public official while
[SPEAKER_02]: on the job being identified as public
official Comment you know on a political
[SPEAKER_03]: issue areas that won't go of course not
well the distinction the law makes is
[SPEAKER_03]: between elected officials who have an
obligation to comment and non-elected
[SPEAKER_03]: officials who are on the public payroll as
civil servants or otherwise public
[SPEAKER_03]: employees and I would think it would be
clear that We don't want the way this law
[SPEAKER_03]: originally came up the the whole context
for the ruling is an Oregon Supreme Court
[SPEAKER_03]: case in which the issue was fluoridation
and a municipal government had actually
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriated money to run a campaign in
favor of fluoridation that was challenged
[SPEAKER_03]: by people who opposed the fluoridation and
The Oregon Supreme Court was quite clear
[SPEAKER_03]: that the government couldn't take public
funds And spend them on one side of an
[SPEAKER_03]: issue Couldn't hire people to go out and
campaign as they did in that instance on
[SPEAKER_03]: one side of an issue and print literature
and all of those things and While the
[SPEAKER_03]: activity in this case hasn't reached that
level the type of activity is exactly the
[SPEAKER_03]: same when officer Jensen is sitting in
front of the television camera questioning
[SPEAKER_03]: the motives and otherwise encourage
discouraging people from signing this
[SPEAKER_03]: initiative his time is being paid for by
the public he's wearing his uniform he's
[SPEAKER_03]: speaking in his official position as
spokesperson for the police department all
[SPEAKER_03]: of these are the Checkoff points for
whether he's speaking in his personal
[SPEAKER_03]: position and has a free speech right to
say what he's saying or whether he's
[SPEAKER_03]: speaking as a public official which is
forbidden under law and violates the
[SPEAKER_03]: fourth amendment the fourth article of the
Constitution Yeah, I mean it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: clear to is it I mean at that time you
know he was the face and voice of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland Police Department That's the one
that they'd show on top of television
[SPEAKER_02]: every night whenever there was you know a
gruesome murder or you know or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to talk about he was the face and
a voice that people saw and so he was the
[SPEAKER_02]: official voice so it's just real obvious
that You know that you know when me come
[SPEAKER_02]: up and ask him for a comment on this he
should have said sorry No, you know come
[SPEAKER_02]: to me after hours over a beer or whatever
and I can tell you what I personally think
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's another element here that
people should be aware of given the laws
[SPEAKER_03]: on confiscation of property and Taking
people's property if they're arrested on a
[SPEAKER_03]: drug offense The number of those laws
target the proceeds of those confiscations
[SPEAKER_03]: to go to the police department So you have
police who essentially collect a bounty?
[SPEAKER_03]: when they bust someone on drugs and That
gives them a bias automatically in favor
[SPEAKER_03]: of a program that pays their salaries as
opposed to changing the laws that would
[SPEAKER_03]: deny them those Access to those resources
so in the police you even have a
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly biased group to be coming out
and campaigning not that any group on the
[SPEAKER_03]: public payroll should be coming out and
campaigning but the police have every
[SPEAKER_03]: reason in the world to violate the law and
Engage in such a campaign which made it
[SPEAKER_03]: even more important that the political
leadership coming from mayor Katz or the
[SPEAKER_03]: Administrative leadership coming from
chief moose say to those officers.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not acceptable behavior.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can understand you may feel strongly
About it, but you're not allowed to use
[SPEAKER_03]: your official position or official time to
go out and campaign politically against
[SPEAKER_03]: this initiative They had almost a doubly
important obligation because this group
[SPEAKER_03]: would be so tempted to go out and protect
their honeypot You know Yeah, they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge economic incentive to Continue the
marijuana laws and they never bring that
[SPEAKER_01]: up You know recently they tried to
recriminalize marijuana here in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_01]: I was down there lobbying against it I Can
tell you that the only people that were
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbying in favor of it were the
Association of Chiefs of Police and the
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbyists for the state police There were
no other lobbyists down there working on
[SPEAKER_01]: this issue except police officer lobbyists
And they're the ones that pushed it
[SPEAKER_01]: through unfortunately we were able to stop
that now We're circulating we stopped it
[SPEAKER_01]: through the referendum process by
gathering 90,000 signatures now We're
[SPEAKER_01]: circulating the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act to
just completely end the war on marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: users and to regulate and tax the sale of
marijuana to adults allow medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and Industrial hemp we need your
help, so please call us at 235-4606 if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're outside of the Portland area and
the show plays in Klamath Falls and Bend
[SPEAKER_01]: and Ashland and Corvallis and Eugene and
also on the internet for outside the
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 503-235-4606 That's 503-235-4606 you
know You both are attorneys Lanny Sinken
[SPEAKER_01]: and Paul Loney, and you're the ones
carrying this case forward Lanny You've
[SPEAKER_01]: had a distinguished past in my opinion
working for the Christic Institute Which
[SPEAKER_01]: be familiar to any historians familiar
with the Iran Contra?
[SPEAKER_01]: Debacle and and I wish we had a little bit
of time to go into that but I can touch on
[SPEAKER_03]: that briefly The Christic Institute filed
a racketeering case against many of the
[SPEAKER_03]: key figures in the Iran Contra scandal We
engaged in all kinds of efforts to gather
[SPEAKER_03]: evidence and put it before the court Four
days before we were supposed to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: trial the judge threw the case out Then he
ruled that the entire case was frivolous
[SPEAKER_03]: fined us 1.2 million dollars And we went
up on appeal to the 11th circuit while we
[SPEAKER_03]: were on appeal one judge was killed by a
bomb there was an attempted assassination
[SPEAKER_03]: of a second judge we know from discussions
with Court personnel that those acts were
[SPEAKER_03]: attributed to our case or at least linked
in their minds to our case So the
[SPEAKER_03]: appellate court at the 11th circuit threw
the appeal out ruled the entire appeal
[SPEAKER_03]: frivolous even though we had amicus briefs
from major national organizations
[SPEAKER_03]: religious organizations legal
organizations political organizations And
[SPEAKER_03]: there was another three or four hundred
thousand dollars in penalties that's
[SPEAKER_03]: assessed against us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They basically put the Christic Institute
out of business That case was about
[SPEAKER_03]: democracy this case is about democracy
There are things that can be so
[SPEAKER_03]: controversial that the democratic system
has a hard time dealing with them in the
[SPEAKER_03]: case of the Christic Institute's
racketeering lawsuit we were talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 years of illegal covert operations and
the judicial system simply could not deal
[SPEAKER_03]: with the evidence that we wanted to
present could not allow the truth to come
[SPEAKER_03]: out that would expose these government
operations and and Damage the faith of the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that their government was operating
in their interest So you had official
[SPEAKER_03]: repression of that lawsuit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar to what we've seen the official
repression directed against the hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: movement, but a democracy is always a
challenge because Democracy means every
[SPEAKER_03]: one of us takes responsibility for making
it work That means every one of us is
[SPEAKER_03]: offended if someone is silenced by the
government or by a policeman or by the
[SPEAKER_03]: mayor or by the city attorney every one of
us should be offended when that happens
[SPEAKER_03]: because if everyone doesn't have freedom
of speech then no one really has freedom
[SPEAKER_03]: of speech and only through the Interplay
of ideas and everyone's views getting on
[SPEAKER_03]: the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we ever reach the best understanding as
to what we should be doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure right now there are major forces
being marshaled to suppress information
[SPEAKER_03]: about global warming and suppress
information about many of the other
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental things the asthma Epidemic
among children that's happening on this
[SPEAKER_03]: planet There will be constantly be efforts
to prevent information from coming out to
[SPEAKER_03]: the public that might change public policy
to the detriment of groups that are
[SPEAKER_03]: engaged in things They shouldn't be doing
so you democracy does require constant
[SPEAKER_03]: vigilance And I think Paul and I as
attorneys are happy to take these kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: cases to the federal judiciary,
but we're also not Pollyannish about it in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of what the federal judiciary can or
will do They're there to protect the
[SPEAKER_03]: Constitution rights of the people but by
now it must be close to 90% of the judges
[SPEAKER_03]: in the federal judiciary have been
appointed by Richard Nixon or Ronald
[SPEAKER_03]: Reagan or George Bush With President
Clinton's appointments also being fairly
[SPEAKER_03]: right-wing generally or at least the
middle of the road the age of the liberal
[SPEAKER_03]: justice You know Justice Douglas if he
came back and looked at the justices who
[SPEAKER_03]: are on the courts now would be appalled at
the kind of activist reactionary judges we
[SPEAKER_03]: have who are undoing many years of civil
rights and other protections that were
[SPEAKER_03]: established by the judiciary You're
fortunate here in Portland and us in
[SPEAKER_03]: Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the Ninth Circuit It is sort of
the last bastion of democracy in the
[SPEAKER_03]: federal judiciary So we're optimistic that
these cases will be successful that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing on behalf of the hemp movement in
Portland but we're not sanguine about
[SPEAKER_03]: what's happening to the federal judiciary
in general and About the loss of freedoms
[SPEAKER_03]: that are taking place in the United States
we in Hawaii are Committed to the
[SPEAKER_03]: sovereignty movement that in one form or
another we trust the islands of Hawaii
[SPEAKER_03]: will leave the United States over the next
five or ten years most people don't
[SPEAKER_03]: realize that Hawaii was an independent
nation up until the late 1800s when a
[SPEAKER_03]: Conspiracy by United States government
officials and plantation owners overthrew
[SPEAKER_03]: the monarchy and then made Hawaii a state
within the United States Many of us in

six Most people don't realize that they

all the lawyers if you go back and

wanted to kill all the lawyers was the
[SPEAKER_03]: lawyers were defending the rights of
people to do things So to get what they
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted they first had to kill all the
lawyers That's what it was being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: rob everyone else to be able to get past
them to get at everybody else So that's
