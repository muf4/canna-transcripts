[SPEAKER_01]: Millions of farmers all over this country
had been losing their farms at the rate of
[SPEAKER_01]: a million a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: At one time there was eight million
working farmers in this country,
[SPEAKER_01]: American family farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're down to probably less than two
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big corporations, it's the old story
of the big ones eating the little ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're running the small farmer off the
land and when that happens the farm town
[SPEAKER_01]: closes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing the hospitals and the
schools go and then what happens is all
[SPEAKER_01]: these people are now unemployed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They move on to the next big city which
causes the same kind of problems in that
[SPEAKER_01]: city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that all the homelessness,
alcoholism, insanity, all these things
[SPEAKER_01]: that we experience, unemployment in our
country can be traced back to the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time the first American farmer was forced
off his land.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he was unable to make a living off of
a hundred to two hundred acres of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for it is because they have
asked him, demanded or made it necessary
[SPEAKER_01]: that he raise a crop below what it costs
him to raise it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loses money on for instance if he just
example figures for instance if he were to
[SPEAKER_01]: it costs him two dollars to or three
dollars to plant and raise and harvest a
[SPEAKER_01]: bushel of corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if he only gets two dollars and fifty
cents for that at the market then he's
[SPEAKER_01]: losing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an accepted practice in
American agriculture today for the farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: to get less than what it costs him to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they keep trying to justify it with
subsidies and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the American farmer would rather go
out here and work hard and make his money
[SPEAKER_01]: the hard way the way he knows how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give him an acre let him do what that acre
can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let him do it without all the pesticides,
without all the chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put his yield so low, his money so
low that he has to use every piece or
[SPEAKER_01]: every gallon of pesticides that he can
find to pour on that acre of land in order
[SPEAKER_01]: to get enough money out to almost break
even.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have forced him into this position.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are even banks who will not loan you
any money at all unless you agree to use X
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of pesticides and chemicals on your
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they know that the only way you
can make your payment is if you get so
[SPEAKER_01]: much off of that acre and the only way you
can get that much off of that acre is to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep pouring the chemicals to that one
acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when did you first become aware of
hemp as a cash crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple years ago I read a book I think
that a lot of us have read by now called
[SPEAKER_01]: The Emperor Wires No Clothes and it was in
that book there was a reprint of an
[SPEAKER_01]: article.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing in that book that I saw that
could not be argued with was an article
[SPEAKER_01]: that came out in a 1938 edition of Popular
Mechanics magazine, February edition if
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody wants to go check it out,
that said a new billion dollar crop for
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that farmers today would be
receptive to growing hemp as a cash crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of all the propaganda we've heard
over the years there are so many people
[SPEAKER_00]: now who believe that it's the evil weed
but we kind of figure it because of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the products that it can create that it
could be a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well definitely I think most people that I
talked to had no idea just like me that
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and marijuana was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were ignorant of that fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also we were ignorant of the fact that
hemp could be used as food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used as clothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first Levi's in this country were made
from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first Bibles were printed on hemp
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Declaration of Independence the first
two copies of this was printed on hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you're out there working with the
farmers side by side do you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to witness ways that we people
who are not involved with the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: communities on a daily basis, those of us
who are driving to and from work and stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: in our offices, what can we do to help the
farmer overcome this misery?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been together as our backbone
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great plan that just I became
aware of it here a year or so ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: last year in fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmers have come up with this idea
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called parity giving.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance if you're a rich guy you got
millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do something for the poor,
the hungry people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would buy direct from the farmers pay
them a certain price.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance for corn if you buy a million
dollars worth of corn from the farmers and
[SPEAKER_01]: pay them three dollars a bush or whatever
the market price is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you would be able to write off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give it to the hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give it to the poor people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you would write off what is
considered a parity price or a fair market
[SPEAKER_01]: price which would be in the neighborhood
of around seven dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would get to charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy it for three dollars and get to
write off seven dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be a great benefit not only
to the guy with money who wants to help to
[SPEAKER_01]: the farmer who gets his products sold and
also to the people out there who are
[SPEAKER_01]: hungry who needs the food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous for people to be starving
to death on this planet when there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of food available.
