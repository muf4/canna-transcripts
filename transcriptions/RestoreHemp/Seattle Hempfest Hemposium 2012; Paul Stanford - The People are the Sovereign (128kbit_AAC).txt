[SPEAKER_00]: If the voters vote yes for your
initiative, can we see a peaceful
[SPEAKER_00]: transaction in the federal government stay
out of the business of Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you anticipate more court
proceedings, or how is that going to
[SPEAKER_00]: proceed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I anticipate more court proceedings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We designed our proposal to deal with what
I've always considered an inevitable
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge by the federal government.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done that by raising a number of
findings by the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all live under the belief here in the
United States that the people are the
[SPEAKER_01]: sovereign and the ruler, so based on that
belief we've had findings by the people
[SPEAKER_01]: written into our proposal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much as Oregon's death with dignity law
was enjoined in federal court and went to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Supreme Court after two years on a
fast track, the Supreme Court ruled that
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors could recommend our prescribed
phenobarbital for terminally ill patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think our bill will go into federal
court and inevitably change the Controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: An even bigger hurdle is the Single
Convention Treaty, which mandates that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis be a Schedule I substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oregon, our Board of Pharmacy has
already rescheduled marijuana to Schedule
[SPEAKER_01]: II, as has the Board of Pharmacy in Iowa,
so two states have already broken with
[SPEAKER_01]: that restriction in contradiction to the
Single Convention Treaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our initiative also imposes a system of
controls that we lifted from the Single
[SPEAKER_01]: Convention Treaty, so time will tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no confidence in the composition of
the Supreme Court under Chief Justice
[SPEAKER_01]: Roberts, but it's the best shot we have,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
