[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Don.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I come from a very different
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it Mordor on the Potomac.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't smell ganja in the air,
you smell sulfur, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a different political reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about the politics
of policy in the West Coast, much less in
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle, where you have a very different
world than exists in much of the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk about how politics gets
done in the other Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why it is that it's so difficult to
get any kind of meaningful reforms
[SPEAKER_00]: initialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a dirty little secret in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one discourse that goes on in
public, and when it comes to voting time
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that stuff, and when the doors are
closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for 13 years now,
talking to members of Congress and their
[SPEAKER_00]: staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're behind closed doors,
the whispering starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think about taxation and
legalization and regulation and
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization And I've heard this from
Democrats and Republicans, conservatives
[SPEAKER_00]: and liberals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always talk about it like they're
the first ones who ever raised that
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so deeply closeted in so many
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like going to a convention of
closeted gay Mormons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all terrified that everyone else
will find out they're the same as everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things I'm trying to do
is figure out how do you depolarize what
[SPEAKER_00]: has been traditionally a third rail,
or the mother of all third rail,
[SPEAKER_00]: political issues in politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third rail, are people familiar with that
term, third rail?
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from the subway system,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two rails carry the train.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third rail carries the high voltage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you touch it, you're dead politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So historically, third rail issues have
been abortion, gay marriage, aid to
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel, gun control, Pentagon budget,
and drugs and crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm trying to do is figure out
a way to depolarize that third rail.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get politicians to say in
public, like what they say in private?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in so doing, I think there's one
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very counterintuitive that may work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can try this not just at the
national level, but at the state and
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal level with associations,
conventions, whether it's a convention of
[SPEAKER_00]: the chiefs of police or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to help people come out of the
closet slowly and dip their toes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has to do with accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to sound heretical,
but I think there's too much
[SPEAKER_00]: accountability in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you might get more responsive
policies if you had temporarily less
[SPEAKER_00]: accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oscar Wilde once said, if you want a man
to tell the truth, give him a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way we can give our politicians
a temporary mask, a non-binding mask,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they can express their views as in a
confessional without risk of being
[SPEAKER_00]: attacked outright?
[SPEAKER_00]: The prime minister of Luxembourg was
talking about a different third rail issue
[SPEAKER_00]: at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said, look, we all know what needs
to be done, but we just don't know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: get re-elected after we've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem can be framed,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Bart Simpson put it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Bart Simpson ran for class president,
he ran by attacking his opponent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, my opponent says there are no
easy answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I say he's not looking hard enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are looking for easy answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Politicians think voters will only
understand simple, short solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if drugs are bad, of course you have
to have a war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're broke, you can't have deficit
spending.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have a stimulus package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's counterintuitive to argue that you do
the opposite might have a better effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the way to do this, then,
is to have a non-binding straw poll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is to say, a procedural exercise for
10 minutes, no one will know how you
[SPEAKER_00]: voted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your party leadership won't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your constituents won't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your funders won't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lobbyists won't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nonprofits won't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one will know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those 10 minutes, for the first
time in Washington, you will have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability, as an elected official,
to think, what is really in the best
[SPEAKER_00]: interest of the United States,
of this generation, of the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, of seven generations down the
line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whose job is to look out for the bigger
picture and to temporarily put partisan
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns aside?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would allow them, then,
to come out of the closet and express
[SPEAKER_00]: their views anonymously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as one person votes in the
opposite way, then no one can know that it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't you that did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard to game this in any kind
of cynical way, but it's a way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: temporary honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is that if you had a
straw poll in Congress that was
[SPEAKER_00]: non-binding, because it has to be
non-binding because the Constitution
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantees that if one-fifth of the quorum
present demands a recorded vote,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to have a recorded vote with
names and who voted yes or no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had this non-binding straw poll
and it turns out that two-thirds of
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress or three-quarters of Congress
thinks we ought to decriminalize or tax
[SPEAKER_00]: and regulate, then just having that
aggregate number at the end, two-thirds or
[SPEAKER_00]: three-quarters, gives members of Congress
some political capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can then come out during the recorded
vote and say, look, I'm just being
[SPEAKER_00]: courageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually saying in public what most of
my colleagues believe in private,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's time we had an open and honest
discussion about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to present that as being
courageous, I'll let them have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a coward's way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a way for them to come out of
that closet slowly without risking attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that jump-start that leapfrogs the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way of manufacturing a tipping
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you imagine if you had the National
Conference of the Chiefs of Police,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you did this anonymous straw poll at
the beginning of their conference,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was announced that two-thirds or
three-quarters of the police chiefs here
[SPEAKER_00]: really believe that we've gone too far
with the drug war, we need to reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: gears, we need to do some counterintuitive
things, and implement harm reduction,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, that would really change the
tenor of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, they're all sitting up on
here on the stage, closeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a way for police chiefs,
for other people in sensitive positions,
[SPEAKER_00]: to come out of the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can really spark a different kind
of conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could save us years in terms of opening
up the discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'll be doing.
Thank you.
