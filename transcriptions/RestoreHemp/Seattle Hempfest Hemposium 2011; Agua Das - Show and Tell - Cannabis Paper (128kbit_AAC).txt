[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Doss here, I'd like to show
everybody how he's made an industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: fiber product from medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Doss here has made some paper
using medical grade cannabis with high
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the unusable plant material beat
in the Peter Beater on loan from Alex
[SPEAKER_01]: White Plume.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is whole stocks from untold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unusable materials from a couple of
dispensaries in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is the fiber from those
stocks without the the herd.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a combination of herds and this
one's 50% cotton and this is 100% hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's so cool.
