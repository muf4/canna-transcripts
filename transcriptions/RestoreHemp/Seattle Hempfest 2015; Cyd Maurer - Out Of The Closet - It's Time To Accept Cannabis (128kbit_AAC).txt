[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first time ever at HepFest,
so I'm really excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming out to
listen, and I feel honored to be up here
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really surreal to be up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a little cliche, but if you
would have told me like a year ago or even
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple months ago that I'd be up here on
this stage today talking to all you about
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, I probably wouldn't have
believed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because I've only been talking
about it for about three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up until then, I was a local news anchor
in Eugene, Oregon, and that was the job I
[SPEAKER_00]: dreamed of having.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to college for it, but it was
abruptly cut short when I was forced to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a drug test, and I failed due to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you probably agree that these sort
of drug testing policies in the workplace
[SPEAKER_00]: are ridiculous, but unfortunately,
even in Oregon and in Washington and other
[SPEAKER_00]: states where it's been legalized,
it's still perfectly legal to have these
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of drug testing policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complete double standard,
and we just need to keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is, no one wants an unsafe work
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all agree on that, but if people
are allowed to use alcohol or
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals or tobacco or what have
you in their free time, then they should
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to use marijuana in their free
time because it's a safer alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is, I was fired for having
inactive THC in my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I was 100% sober, at work
every day that I reported to work,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I would have stuck to the encouraged
vices of drinking or using
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals, I would still have my job
today as a local news anchor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I probably see that ridiculous
double standard, but a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that still, and it's,
I think, our responsibility to point it
[SPEAKER_00]: out so that people do understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way we're gonna ever see
more changes to policies and laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a great job right now,
but there is still a long way to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're familiar with cannabis and you
know its effects and you've used it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're exposed to it, I think that it's
kind of hard to even understand how people
[SPEAKER_00]: can be so against it or even understand
why we're having this argument,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it all comes back to a lack of
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just expose people to the truth more
about cannabis, then I think a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: people would understand and support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe some of you have even
changed your views on marijuana over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I was a dare kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 10 years old being told all these
facts about marijuana that I just took for
[SPEAKER_00]: fact because I didn't know any better and
I was so young, but then as I got older
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was actually exposed to marijuana
and exposed to people who used cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that it wasn't as scary as
everyone made it out to be, but it took
[SPEAKER_00]: that exposure, and I really, truly believe
there are a lot of people out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: are just like me, that if they were
exposed to it, and they knew the truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: there'd be no way that they could possibly
be against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be part of the change if you just
talk to your friends, family, peers,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you haven't already, about your
cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually just tell them that using
marijuana doesn't make you a bad person,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that seems like kind of a fact that we
all understand here, but a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: out there don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still all these misconceptions
that just using this plant makes you a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to put an end to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're thinking about coming out of the
cannabis closet, I've learned a few things
[SPEAKER_00]: so far, and I just want to share them with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, like I said, it's only been
about three weeks, and the response has
[SPEAKER_00]: been overwhelmingly positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everyone who's reached out to me
individually has not only been so
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive, but they've thanked me for
talking about this because there are so
[SPEAKER_00]: many people out there that will still lose
their family, lose their jobs,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they even talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that here in a state where it's
legal, if you can talk about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: please do because the overwhelming support
shows we have strength in numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, the haters are still going to
hate, unfortunately, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily a bad thing because
fortunately all the ignorant and cruel
[SPEAKER_00]: comments have been outnumbered by a ratio
of about 15 to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they're talking about it,
and negatively, they're still talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, and that leads me to number
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the haters have spoken up,
coming out of the cannabis closet is
[SPEAKER_00]: totally worth it because even when they're
using their ignorant remarks, it's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end, the story is getting everyone to talk
about the facts, and if you know the facts
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis, the facts are in our
favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I believe because of the facts,
the social acceptance of cannabis use is
[SPEAKER_00]: inevitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of how fast it happens,
and the only way it's going to happen is
[SPEAKER_00]: if we keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it from me, a former local news
anchor, now marijuana activist,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will not regret it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
