[SPEAKER_00]: The Godfather of Hemp movement who really
began this movement I guess in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taught us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack died just last year and I was lucky
enough to be able to do his eulogy or be
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the people at his eulogy and I made
it my mind when I knew I was going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to dedicate my travel and my
appearance on this show to my good friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Kerr and I wrote a eulogy about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who do not know,
Jack Kerr wrote The Emperor Wears No
[SPEAKER_00]: Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way I remember Jack Kerr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Kerr is a social and philosophical
tsunami.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ripples from whose splash will forever
grace the shores of human consciousness in
[SPEAKER_00]: every freedom loving nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a grand champion of We the People
and the natural cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our battle with the synthetic
subversion which threatens the very
[SPEAKER_00]: concept of the sovereignty of each human
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack's tireless efforts to eliminate the
facts about cannabis have furnished
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom fighters everywhere with the tools
of knowledge with which to resist the
[SPEAKER_00]: fascism of the corporate state as it seeks
to subject everyone to its economic bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack recognized that cannabis is indeed a
gateway to existentialism which enlightens
[SPEAKER_00]: our existence and is the basis of our
freedom of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also recognized the miraculous powers
of this herb for healing and many sick and
[SPEAKER_00]: dying people have found comfort in its use
after reading his wonderful manifesto,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Kerr's grand spirit may have left his
worn out body but he has entered into the
[SPEAKER_00]: hearts and minds of millions of us who
will be forever grateful to have been
[SPEAKER_00]: educated by his commitment to the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
