[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to stop the rape of our freedom,
the violation of our personal rights,
[SPEAKER_00]: our civil rights, our human rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to realize that the cannabis
movement is a peace movement, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: movement is a human rights movement,
the cannabis movement is a civil rights
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been laughing at us, they've been
ridiculing us, they've been making fun of
[SPEAKER_00]: us, they've been denigrating us,
they've been ridiculing us, they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: arresting us, They've actually killed many
of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shot many of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have stolen our children from us to
be raised by foster parents that tell our
[SPEAKER_00]: children, oh, your parents are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your parents don't love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your parents are criminals because they
had a pot plant in the same house as you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're swilling their alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're smoking their cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, cigarettes kill 400,000
people every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol kills 40,000 people every,
well, alcohol kills 40,000 people from a
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic reaction and from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many wife beatings?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many murders?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many rapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many suicides?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many car accidents from alcohol?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many millions of people die from
alcohol every year?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a disgrace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just talking about America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all over the world, how many
people die?
[SPEAKER_00]: 40,000 people die from tobacco in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people die from tobacco?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people die from marijuana in
10,000 years of use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zilch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's ever died from a toxic reaction
or an overdose of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in 1988, the DEA administrative
judge,
[SPEAKER_00]: Francis Young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had four hours sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the National Stereo Underground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Valhalla has arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't know I was nervous,
but I didn't think that the last band was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this has been an incredible
disgrace to our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: These laws are un-American.
[SPEAKER_00]: Judge Francis Young said that marijuana is
one of the safest non-toxic therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: substances in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you eat 10 raw potatoes, did you know
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 raw potatoes could kill you from a
toxic reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could eat 10 pounds of marijuana
and you'd be sick as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd be throwing up real bad and
you'd be unable to walk, but you ain't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't die from marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't kill you, man, because it's an
incredibly beautiful, wonderful,
[SPEAKER_00]: loving, peaceful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a friendly, loving, healing herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have lied and lied and lied and
lied and lied to advance these disgusting
[SPEAKER_00]: laws that are enemies of justice,
that are undermining a general respect for
[SPEAKER_00]: the rule of law among millions of young
Americans that think, well, these laws all
[SPEAKER_00]: screwed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I shouldn't obey any law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I smoke pot, they said it was
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bet cocaine must be OK, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet heroin must be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet methamphetamine must be cool,
too, because they lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lied about pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must be lying about heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lie about cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many people die from all that
stuff, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now, while we're having a
great time, there's somebody hiding in
[SPEAKER_00]: their closet smoking a crack pipe,
man, freaking out in the dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing voices and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's somebody smoking meth right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, man, probably within earshot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of here somewhere, there's somebody
shooting heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's somebody doing crack.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the drug war actually promotes that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they spend more money putting
people away for cannabis than for
[SPEAKER_00]: methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin,
ecstasy, all combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of the money spent in America for the
drug war, it's a war against cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: users.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug war?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug war?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pharmaceutical companies are selling
billions of dollars worth of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend $5 on the drug, and they charge
$500, and it kills you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's addictive, and it's toxic,
and it ruins your liver and your kidneys
[SPEAKER_00]: and your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they call it medicine, and they call
our medicine, which has never killed
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody, drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the drug war is one big,
ugly, rancid, pus-filled, infected lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they use that lie to destroy the lives
of decent, wonderful, chilling brothers
[SPEAKER_00]: and sisters who are iry and who are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how many cool people are in
prison getting prison raped by somebody,
[SPEAKER_00]: man?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a disgrace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm willing to risk my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say risk my life, I mean,
this is so stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just had three trips to the doctor
and to the hospital thinking I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: heart attack, man, from anxiety attacks
over HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have developed what's called premature
atrial complex of my heart, skipping a
[SPEAKER_00]: beat and stuff, because of the stress of
Seattle HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not kidding, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ears ring every day of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ears ring so bad that I'm a Buddhist,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Tibetan Buddhist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't go to the temple anymore,
to the monastery, because it's silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my ears ring so fucking loud from
being up here for 20 years, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can't even do that, because it
drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of our staff members have been
here for like 12 hours, 16 hours in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same sweaty shirt that they wore
yesterday, because they get one staff
[SPEAKER_00]: shirt for a three-day HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got blisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have blisters all over my toes last
night when I got home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be here until Wednesday picking
up cigarette butts when we're out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll all be here for days after you're
all gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of our staff leave after tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe 100 of us will be here
tearing all this down, packing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't get everything out by Tuesday,
$800 a day for every item left in the park
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do it anyway, because it's the
right thing to do, because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans, and we love our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can have a HempFest because of
our Constitution, our free speech,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our freedom of assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do it anyway, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never know if it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a total leap of faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, my god, it's three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the volunteers going to be there on
Friday?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to have a staff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's get this out of your way,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get that totally out of your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you want it there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I'm done preaching to you all,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to know the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my heart song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter what it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I sign the permit for Seattle
HempFest, I'm going, oh my god,
[SPEAKER_00]: what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the permit, it says you will take full
responsibility for everything that happens
[SPEAKER_00]: at Seattle HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sign that bugger every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys have never let me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you, the greatest science in the
world.
