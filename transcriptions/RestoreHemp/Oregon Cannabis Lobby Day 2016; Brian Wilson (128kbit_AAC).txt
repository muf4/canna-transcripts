[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Brian Wilson, I go by Brian the Red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been an activist my entire life,
seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see the changes that they are
trying to make to the programs that we
[SPEAKER_00]: voted in as a people, it really turns my
stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked on the medical campaigns back in
the 90s because my father had a broken
[SPEAKER_00]: back and degenerative disc disease since
before I was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that could get him up out
of laying in agony in bed, not even able
[SPEAKER_00]: to tie his own shoes for weeks at a time
was a small puff of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That small miracle got him up out of bed
and taking four to five mile bike rides
[SPEAKER_00]: with my brothers and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I fought for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I lost a really good friend to
brain cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a GBM glioblastoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: GBM glioblastoma multiform stage four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually people, when they get the
diagnosis of that condition, they aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: given more than about nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He survived 22 months and died just last
month, not in a hospital, surrounded by
[SPEAKER_00]: machines and incompetent doctors,
but in his home, surrounded by his family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the people in these buildings,
they don't realize the lives that their
[SPEAKER_00]: pen strokes affect until it's their
grandparents, it's their brother,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's their father, their mother,
their sister, or themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to wake up and realize that
people are dying every day and for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at a ledger and see only dollar signs
and the taxes that can come in to fund the
[SPEAKER_00]: programs that we don't even give a crap
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me really sad, you know,
and but to see all you guys out here
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting, that makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that we've got a chance that
there is a future here and that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bright possibility that we will get
everything we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not exactly the free freedom that we
all want.
[SPEAKER_00]: People thought that once it passed,
hey, we are at the finish line.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is just the bottom of a hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at the forefront of the greatest
race of our lives and we need to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: running until we get the rights that we
deserve to be treated like regular people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people who don't have options to
actually have something that they can turn
[SPEAKER_00]: to besides, oh, sorry, what, you want some
pharmaceuticals here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put you on the roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't work for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try this other pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they can line the pockets of some
big businessman who lives in a high rise
[SPEAKER_00]: apartment and jets around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely not Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to keep fighting and you
guys better hear us in that building
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we get what we want and what we
deserve as human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
