[SPEAKER_00]: Well, about four years ago in 2010,
Ben had noticed some lumps he had on his
[SPEAKER_00]: posterior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a former naturopathic physician's
assistant, he could kind of almost predict
[SPEAKER_00]: that it might be cancer, but he wasn't
quite sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got blown off by his family doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't going to give us a referral,
so he told them it was a calcium deposit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was already growing some marijuana
for the purpose of dealing with his heart
[SPEAKER_00]: condition, kind of keeping his blood
pressure at a rate where it would give him
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of energy and kind of turn
off the gravity amplifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd been watching YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw the YouTube show on, I guess,
the Rick Simpson story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he learned about that,
run from the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he decided to apply that,
just thinking this lump might be cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he applied it, and he thought,
well, if it's not, let's just see what it
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he had a golf ball-sized,
well, he found out later it was a tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after applying it topically for within
about two months, it shrank down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of a, well, down to a little pink
spot, I mean, it went below the surface of
[SPEAKER_00]: the skin and disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually, someone must have called
the police thinking they smelled marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: in our apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had shown the police officer what
he had been using the marijuana for,
[SPEAKER_00]: that he was making cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he even showed him how he applied it
before he confiscated it, before the
[SPEAKER_00]: officer Furlong, Detective Furlong,
confiscated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through a year of basically firing
attorneys, trying to get someone who would
[SPEAKER_00]: represent us and not force us to plea out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually, we just gave up on
that and went ahead and took a guilty plea
[SPEAKER_00]: of manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to present a medical defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one was going to hear it, and they just
weren't going to go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had been on probation for a couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first couple of months in 2011,
he had finally got a referral to an
[SPEAKER_00]: oncologist who came back with a result
after giving him a biopsy that it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, angiosarcoma cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cancer of the inner lining of the
blood vessels, which appears as tumors on
[SPEAKER_00]: the skin, above the surface of the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while on probation, Ben decided to
just try to get ahold of whatever plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material he could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes ditch weed, friends would
harvest some out of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in Iowa, it just grows
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would make cannabis oil out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes he had to go to the street to
buy cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually, he was able to acquire
just enough for a couple of grams here and
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would ingest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was able to keep the tumors from
growing, and some of them would even
[SPEAKER_00]: shrink, some of the smaller ones
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this went on for, well, about two and
a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in June 2013, well, I'm getting
ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started growing cannabis in a trailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the backyard, his best friend helped
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had all higher CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he had canatonic, which I think
came from some Z7 seeds that he'd ordered
[SPEAKER_00]: from Mr. Nice, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he had plants that were,
you know, eventually going to possibly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if he could acquire enough,
he could make enough oil to maybe wipe out
[SPEAKER_00]: this cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at this point, it was at stage
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really small tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and then 2013, June of 2013,
we were raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they brought about 20 SWAT agents in
at 5.45 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to the house, banging on the door,
screaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the first one to the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had about, well, about six agents
pointing at me, you know, some pretty high
[SPEAKER_00]: powered weaponry in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it kind of scared the crap
out of all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in that situation myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know what that's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his elderly parents were upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it kind of it shocked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just the five of us living
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they ended up prosecuting all five of
you, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parents, your son, both of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what they do is they they
try to pile on as many charges as they
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can then manipulate you to do what
they want you to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're going to torture your wife and
your son and your parents if you don't do
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what we say to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's disgusting, you know,
that our law enforcement has turned to
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really the prosecutors and the police
are in charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the whole system and choosing how to
charge you and make you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: dance to their tune or else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it appeared that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they didn't arrest his parents,
but they did charge them with operating a
[SPEAKER_00]: drug house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of makes it sound like a meth lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: How old are your parents, Benton?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're respectively, I think,
70.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, they were 76 and 77 years
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Benton, I just got to let our audience
know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been the recipient of some
beneficial cannabis oil here in Oregon as
[SPEAKER_01]: a legal medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud to say that, you know,
we were able to help you get that medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've helped you out with some medicine in
the past, but I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, you're on a pretty big dose
of RSO oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, six grams a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's six grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I don't think I've ever heard of
anybody taking six grams in a single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured you vaporized twice that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half of my lungs full of tumors,
I just found out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that cancer is metastasized to your
lungs and where else?
[SPEAKER_03]: In my liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your liver and your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you've just been convicted when?
[SPEAKER_01]: About 10 days ago?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just about two weeks ago, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: About two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, fortunately, with a bond,
the state has allowed you to come here and
[SPEAKER_01]: visit Oregon a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, they started letting me come
here so I could survive to make it to the
[SPEAKER_03]: end of trial.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go on with the story,
Loretta, and what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we were arrested, his parents
had bonded us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a couple of weeks later, because we'd
been on probation, our probation officers
[SPEAKER_00]: issued warrants for our arrest again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, back to jail we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, there was a $5,000 cash-only
bond held over both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, his parents being, you know,
broke, completely unable to get us out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they couldn't do anything about it,
we ended up staying there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he stayed in for 40 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was constantly trying to draw the
attention of the medical staff,
[SPEAKER_00]: his tumors, which were starting to grow
without anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to say that I've seen some
pictures of your tumors online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just very sorry that you have to
endure such painful lesions there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some other people with sarcoma
back before they had the antiviral agents
[SPEAKER_01]: when people were dying from AIDS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of reminded me of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a similar kind of cancer,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might be the same form that
ended up killing so many AIDS patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you have a compromised immune system.
[SPEAKER_03]: That too.
[SPEAKER_03]: My immune system is not quite as
compromised as it probably should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got this rare form of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you want to tell us about the trial,
Loretta?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's taken several months since we
got out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had pretty good representation,
each of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of different things that
they wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to try to see if they could
get all of the evidence suppressed and the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole case thrown out of court because we
live in a rural area in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on private property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, when the police had been going
through our trash to try to find
[SPEAKER_00]: something, they said they found a stem and
that was the justification for the
[SPEAKER_00]: warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had been trespassing on a private
drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we had upcoming motions, hearings for
the motions on suppression to try to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if the warrant was even valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's taken an entire year since the
original raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted a jury of our peers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, we had attorneys who were
with it all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were filing motions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were doing everything they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is his good attorney lost her
license because, well, it doesn't seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had been doing a lot of work for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there was somebody higher up
trying to kind of cut her out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'll describe to you what happened
during the trial, sort of the control,
[SPEAKER_00]: mind control or just wanting to have
another conviction no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like it was not a fair trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judge would not allow a medical
defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wouldn't even allow Ben to tell the
jury that he had cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't even allowed to discuss his
condition at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the jury had no idea what you folks
were facing or the very reason you were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they also prosecuted your son.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, his friend originally, but they
offered a plea agreement to his friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess he took it because he was very
scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't going to be throwing us under
the bus, mind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had been looking for an opportunity to
become a state's witness so that it would
[SPEAKER_00]: give him an opportunity to, when taking
the witness stand, to just risk all,
[SPEAKER_00]: risk getting thrown in contempt to court
to say, look, this is what my friend was
[SPEAKER_00]: going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was helping him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was making cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it seemed like the state was pretty
much onto the strategy of our defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't allow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It controlled every aspect of the jury
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took a good three days to even
select a jury because so many people had
[SPEAKER_00]: already read newspaper articles that the
Quad City Times writer, Brian Wellner,
[SPEAKER_00]: had been following up on our stories since
September of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was just so much control and
constantly keeping the jury in the dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would take them in the other room to
address issues going on with Ben's health.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needed to take a lot of breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the seventh of July,
right in the middle of trial, he pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much collapsed, he had, we had to rush him
to the hospital, called an ambulance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his potassium levels and his
hemoglobin had just dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd been sweating profusely, just having
cold sweats for the last couple of months,
[SPEAKER_00]: because at this point, he's at stage four
of his cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything metastasized when he was in
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just kind of went from stage one to
stage three to stage four in a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's at the point now where cold sweats
and nausea and things like that start to
[SPEAKER_00]: set in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, this happened without the jury
having any idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just shoved off to their little
deliberation room, probably under lock and
[SPEAKER_00]: key and not allowed to even look out the
window and see the fire trucks that came
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling up in front of the ambulance,
pulling up in front of the courthouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the judge was not very understanding,
like he promised he would be about Ben's
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: He basically thought that Ben was
malingering, that maybe he was faking
[SPEAKER_00]: something to try to get out of this trial,
which is not the case at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got him to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had to give him a transfusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the doctor's orders were, no,
he's not going anywhere tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's staying here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to watch over him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next morning, they were trying to
address keeping his pain medication
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilized and all of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the judge was insistent, well,
he needs to be back the next morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get on with this trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was inhumane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredibly inhumane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ashamed for our government that's done
this to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish I could offer you sanctuary
here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe we can put you in a local
church or something and say, no more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in the safe zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an ancient concept that we should
have something like that, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially for someone going through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we appreciate it, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just no way we could bow out of
this fight now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: They mentioned an appeal bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, you're here in Oregon on a
bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's likely?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had any communication that says
you might be allowed to continue to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: appeal bond?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm actually not on a bond.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife is out on bond.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they let me out of jail to avoid any
medical expenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So technically, until sentencing,
if they sentence me to any jail time or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything at all, they're going to try to
put me in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they'll wait until I apply
or appeal it before they try to put me in
[SPEAKER_03]: jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, if they put me in jail,
then I can bond out from there.
Probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the support that seems to be rallying
around the case and all that you've gone
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in California, they have groups
that show up at courthouses with signs and
[SPEAKER_02]: make a lot of noise outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and any community support?
[SPEAKER_02]: Has there been?
[SPEAKER_03]: There was noise of it happening,
but we haven't seen a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're in a little area, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not any big urban area except Des
Moines in Iowa, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: For its area, the Quad Cities area is
pretty big.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about Iowa City size, maybe even
bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the community support's been really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why did you have such a problem with
your attorneys taking your case in the
[SPEAKER_02]: direction you wanted?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's your case.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was saddled with him with a month to go
before jury selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was contacted by him for
another two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had two weeks to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: To build a case.
[SPEAKER_03]: First thing he wanted was to try to deal
with this on a plea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just demanded he never, ever enter
into that train of thought again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when we started clashing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he had plans on trying to change
things instead of being straight with me
[SPEAKER_03]: and backing out.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I still had time to give somebody
else exactly the same chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to at least support me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loretta, how do you think things are going
to go for yourself and your son and your
[SPEAKER_01]: husband here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any insight or just hopes and
prayers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopes and prayers, mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been suggested that we'll have...
Well, I did talk to his father.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a former attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said something about appeals bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really not completely educated
about that whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked to a couple of other people
who have been through this process before
[SPEAKER_00]: who think that we are in a position to
wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't... At this point,
I don't think after all the attention that
[SPEAKER_00]: this judge, Henry Latham, has had,
which has not been the right kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: He certainly is not a hero now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone in Iowa and basically nationwide,
since the story went out on the Associated
[SPEAKER_00]: Press, it's been everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had to shut down the phone lines
to his lines and the prosecutor's phone
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just been so many people calling.
[SPEAKER_01]: When is your sentencing coming up?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're here in Oregon for just a few days,
like a week or less than a week?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sentencing is on August 28th.
[SPEAKER_01]: August 28th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want people to contact this judge
and to be there in support of you on
[SPEAKER_01]: August 28th, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also a group on Facebook,
Free Benton McKenzie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's facebook.com slash Free Benton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Free Benton McKenzie is actually the
public group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And freebenton.org is the website that
some local people did put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do have some... They do have
basically an event coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are quite a few people that are
planning on being there, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that at?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be at the Scott County
Courthouse in Davenport, Iowa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will have some people showing up
maybe with picket signs, maybe just to
[SPEAKER_00]: show up in the courtroom if they'll let
them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's this judge's name in Scott
County, Iowa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Davenport, Iowa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Judge Henry Latham.
[SPEAKER_01]: Henry Latham.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
