[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Portland Normal and 420 Radio and
Urbage Designs, and I'm also an Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: resident and voter, and so I've been
involved in this cannabis community for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's a privilege for all of us
to be together and get to do these things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we voted for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we voted for in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, unfortunately, we're having to
come here, and we've always spoke about
[SPEAKER_00]: our cannabis rights, and we've made that
point for years and years, but
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, now we're also having to
make a point about the system and about
[SPEAKER_00]: voting, which we voted in 2014 not to
change the OMMP, and all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been having to do these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I had to take off work to come
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you also had to take off work,
and whatever you had to do to come here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're having to argue things that
we've been arguing for years and years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we shouldn't have to be arguing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be working together with our
legislators who are in session right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I appreciate all you guys coming
here today to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things about the
cannabis community is we're a big team,
[SPEAKER_00]: and right now, the team that's on dock
right now is the team here, and tomorrow
[SPEAKER_00]: and the next day, there'll be some
different faces here from our community as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, and so we are definitely a big team,
and we're here supporting freedom,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're supporting our cannabis rights,
recreational users.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the reasons that we voted
in 2014 was to not arrest people anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: and to have a great system that we can all
be proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already had the OMMP system that
we've all been proud of for many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the reasons we were able to
pass in 2014 because it is one of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: programs in the United States,
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: People learn from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We teach this stuff, and that's how we
should be doing, and unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure we're being heard as well as
we'd like to these days, and so that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: we are calling these things together,
and that's why we're coming together and
[SPEAKER_00]: vote for certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like clean air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Oregon has some of the cleanest
air ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love our clean air, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want clean air, but give us a place
where we can have clean air and our fog
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna fog up some air, too,
in a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we don't have hardly anywhere
to go legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's things that we're fighting for,
unfortunately, and maybe that is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: should be fighting for, but one of the
things we should not be fighting for is
[SPEAKER_00]: for the OMMP, and so we have to continue
to stand up for our rights, and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we need to do to not change
that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many of us voted in 2014 yes
was because the program wasn't gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: changed, and we were gonna be able to move
on and have a great system for the state
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a tax system, and everyone's
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suits in there are happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's getting a product that we are
grown here in Oregon by our Oregon state
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, and so with our Oregon tax
system, and so these are the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've gotta continue to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all of you guys coming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see many, many faces that I always see,
and please keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm Scott, and I'm with Portland
Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any information that you guys want,
there's some bills coming up right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in session, working these days
right now, and so if you need any
[SPEAKER_00]: information about the bills going on,
any of the senators, representatives that
[SPEAKER_00]: make up the legislator, all this is right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Lee mentioned, on Monday nights,
we have a legislative committee,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so you guys can also hit us up at the
Portland Normal website where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: information there, and so just stay
active, and we'll all get this together,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will make Oregon the best program
that we know it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys again for coming out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
