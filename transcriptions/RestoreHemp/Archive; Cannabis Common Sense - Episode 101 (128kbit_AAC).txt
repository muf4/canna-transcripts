[SPEAKER_01]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act petition will
do a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to talk about that Paul?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, thanks Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our petition, once it becomes enacted,
will enable pharmacies to sell at cost to
[SPEAKER_02]: patients medicinal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will allow our farmers to grow hemp and
compete in the world markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will allow individuals to grow in their
own personal quantities of hemp and will
[SPEAKER_02]: allow the sale of marijuana to people in
coffee shops, in bars, and in liquor
[SPEAKER_02]: stores, just like hard alcohol is sold
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a comprehensive reworking of our
laws, as I always like to tell folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This initiative is going to raise hundreds
of millions of dollars in revenue for the
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really know exactly how much,
but we can say hundreds of millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars, because I like the sound,
that hundreds of millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also Paul, you don't want to forget
that it's also going to allow us to save
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't be spending so much money on
putting people in jail, hiring district
[SPEAKER_02]: attorneys, hiring police officers,
public defenders, judges.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all adds up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be saving money as well as
getting tax money off of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hundreds of millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we dedicate that money,
90% of it, to the state general fund,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the legislature can decide how to
spend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope they'll put it toward education.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other 10%, 8% of that left,
goes to drug treatment programs so that
[SPEAKER_01]: alcoholics and other people with substance
abuse problems can get the help they need
[SPEAKER_01]: when they need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Final 2%, 1% would go to a comprehensive
drug education program for kids in schools
[SPEAKER_01]: taught by educational professionals,
not by the police like the DARE program is
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that last 1% would go to fund a state
agricultural committee to promote
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial hemp to try to restore its
place here in our economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting to today's show, which should
be a lot of fun for folks, it's a real
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyable one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a good interview later on in the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But coming up first, we'll have some more
scenes of the million marijuana march up
[SPEAKER_02]: in Seattle that took place on May Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right off the bat, we've got an
interesting couple of characters here that
[SPEAKER_01]: were singing a song that we found rather
humorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So roll that tape, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give me the change Just
[SPEAKER_03]: give me the change All we are saying Just
give me the change All we are saying Just
[SPEAKER_03]: give me the change Just give
[SPEAKER_03]: me the change All we are saying Just give
me the change So everybody's talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: frying, dying, flying, crying,
cocaine, cocaine, Prozac, Guadalajara,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All we need to try All we are saying Just
give me the change
[SPEAKER_03]: All we are saying Just give me the chance
[SPEAKER_03]: All we are saying Just give me the change
All we are saying Just give me the change
[SPEAKER_03]: All we are saying Just give me the change
[SPEAKER_01]: All we are saying Just give me the change
All we are saying Just give me the change
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time it finished in downtown
Seattle, it had grown to three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand, is the estimate, stretching for
three or four city blocks through downtown
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organizer of the march were the folks
that do the Seattle Hemp Fest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a huge rally that they have
every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming up on August 22nd this year,
down on the waterfront in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the organizer is Vivian McPeak,
and he was the emcee at the rally after
[SPEAKER_01]: the million marijuana march.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Vivian McPeak, who is also the emcee of
the Seattle Hemp Fest, which generally has
[SPEAKER_01]: about 50,000 people at it the past few
years, is up next on the stage at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Westlake Center in downtown Seattle at the
conclusion of the million marijuana march.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nora Callahan was supposed to be here
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nora is the director of the November
coalition out of Colville, Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: The November coalition is one of the most
powerful organizations in the country to
[SPEAKER_05]: end the drug war.
[SPEAKER_05]: It started around 1977, right before the
Seattle Hemp Fest that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the November coalition does is it
puts names and faces behind the prisoners,
[SPEAKER_05]: the POWs of the war on drugs and the war
on pot, and also behind the hidden victims
[SPEAKER_05]: of the war on pot and the war on drugs,
which is the children, the orphans,
[SPEAKER_05]: the wives, the husbands, the brothers and
sisters, the parents, the families of the
[SPEAKER_05]: people whose lives have been destroyed and
crushed, who will spend years,
[SPEAKER_05]: years, years, decades in jail for a
harmless, benign, therapeutic herb,
[SPEAKER_05]: which never killed anyone with an
overdose, never killed anyone from
[SPEAKER_05]: toxicity, ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: If somebody tells you different,
it's a bold-faced lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reason that Nora can't be here
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nora's brother Patrick is serving a
23-year prison sentence, mandatory minimum
[SPEAKER_05]: sentence, no chance of parole.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was caught in what's called a dry
conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Under conspiracy laws, you can be sent to
prison with absolutely no concrete
[SPEAKER_05]: evidence whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be sent to prison on hearsay
evidence alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: By paid informants who are already felons
incarcerated, who have nothing to lose but
[SPEAKER_05]: everything to gain from lying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nora's brother, Patrick Callahan,
is in a federal penitentiary on the other
[SPEAKER_05]: side of the country serving his 23-year
sentence, and he's in the late stages of
[SPEAKER_05]: liver disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now would be a good time to send a healing
prayer, a healing thought, a healing vibe
[SPEAKER_05]: to Patrick and Nora and all of the
Patricks and Noras across our planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people are online?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people, raise your hand,
are online with computers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now put your hands down.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people are on HempNet as your
internet service provider?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to change soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp.net is an internet service provider.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has done all of the web design for
Seattle HempFest website.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people have seen our website,
www.seattlehempfest.com?
[SPEAKER_05]: I introduce you to my good friend and
colleague, Robert Lunde, owner and
[SPEAKER_05]: operator of HempNet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello Seattle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right here in the middle of Westlake
Center, you guys look awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you who attended some of the
marches against prohibition last year,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you can appreciate the numbers we
see here today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Prepare a little something to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today we've been marching and speaking out
against the numerous injustices brought on
[SPEAKER_06]: the American people by the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we may be a diverse group of people
with differing opinions on the issue,
[SPEAKER_06]: but one thing is common amongst us all.
[SPEAKER_06]: The war on drugs has affected the lives of
every one of us enough so that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: willing to get in the streets and march
and say that things have got to change and
[SPEAKER_06]: the drug war is over.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know the drug war is wrong because it's
fraught with injustice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Forfeiture laws are unjust because they
allow a home or car to be taken without an
[SPEAKER_06]: individual to be charged with a crime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mandatory minimums are unjust because
there's no room to consider the
[SPEAKER_06]: circumstances that go along with the rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: The judge should have that option.
[SPEAKER_06]: The legislature should not be saying you
go to jail for 10 years because you are
[SPEAKER_06]: related.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or heard about a drug bust.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cannabis prohibition is unjust.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our laws are hypocrisy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hypocrisy that we can drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kills hundreds of people every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hundreds of thousands.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hypocrisy that you can legally smoke
nicotine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet it kills hundreds of thousands of
people every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet I'll stand here and say you have
the right to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should, as a free American,
be able to consume nicotine, to drink
[SPEAKER_06]: alcohol, and smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's the result of this unjust war?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for example, there's a Mr. Gray who
was a U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marine for five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: He went off and served this country in the
Gulf War.
[SPEAKER_06]: He came back with numerous unexplainable
illnesses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uncontrollable vomiting.
[SPEAKER_06]: He went to the VA hospital 20 times.
[SPEAKER_06]: They prescribed numerous legal drugs,
none of them which could help him.
[SPEAKER_06]: So finally he turned, like many sufferers
of the Gulf War syndrome do, to marijuana,
[SPEAKER_06]: and he found relief.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do we thank him?
[SPEAKER_06]: We steal his fucking house.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another injustice is the East Side
Narcotics Task Force.
[SPEAKER_06]: We allow them to engage in terrorist
tactics, destroying homes, and
[SPEAKER_06]: traumatizing children house after house
after house.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's unjust.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unjust that Will Foster, who grows
marijuana for his own personal medical
[SPEAKER_06]: reason, should be sentenced to 93 years in
jail in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_06]: The drug war needs to change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eighty percent of our forfeitures occur
where no individual was charged with a
[SPEAKER_06]: crime.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is such an injustice,
and we don't have to look farther than our
[SPEAKER_06]: own law of Washington to see the problems
with this law.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to read the three pillars of
the Washington State Forfeiture Law.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tenet number one, and this is in the HIPP
Voters Guide if you saw this last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, in cases involving personal
property, the burden of producing evidence
[SPEAKER_06]: shall be upon the person claiming to be
the lawful owner of the property.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the cops.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they plan something, it's up to you to
prove it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If your friend has a joint in your car,
and they take your car, it's your
[SPEAKER_06]: responsibility to prove it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no due process in that,
and there's no justice in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why does it happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: We look at the next two pillars of the
Washington State Forfeiture Law.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two is each seizing agency shall
remit to the state treasurer at about
[SPEAKER_06]: equal to 10 percent of the net proceeds of
any of the property forfeited.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the final pillar, what happens to the
other 90 percent?
[SPEAKER_06]: Forfeited property and the net proceeds
not required to be paid to the state
[SPEAKER_06]: treasurer shall be retained by the seizing
law enforcement agency.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is an invitation for corruptness.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is no longer a balanced justice system
that we're supposed to have in the United
[SPEAKER_06]: States.
[SPEAKER_06]: The forfeiture laws and the drug war needs
to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're stealing it!
[SPEAKER_04]: We're stealing it!
[SPEAKER_02]: We're stealing it!
[SPEAKER_01]: We're stealing it!
[SPEAKER_01]: We're stealing it!
[SPEAKER_01]: We're stealing it!
[SPEAKER_01]: We're stealing it!
[SPEAKER_02]: We're stealing it!
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I heard, that it did approach
a million.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole idea behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past, it never had a million.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, they had a million marchers
across the world speaking up for
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, and I'm hoping next year on May
Day, it'll grow even bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So remember that date, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: May Day next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take part in the million marijuana march
on May Day next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else you can take part in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're circulating the Oregon Cannabis Tax
Act petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will allow adults to legally buy
marijuana through the state liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bars and other shops that get the license
will be able to serve marijuana the same
[SPEAKER_01]: way they serve mixed alcoholic drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will also allow farmers to cultivate
the drug for sales to the Oregon Liquor
[SPEAKER_01]: Control Commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oregon Liquor Control Commission would
sell it through pharmacies, both in Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: and outside, at cost, where it just
covered the cost of the agency and the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers' expenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it would sell it at a profit
through our state liquor stores and raise
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would also allow adults to grow
their own and allow farmers to cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial hemp without a license so that
they could produce paper, fabric,
[SPEAKER_01]: protein, oil, fuel, and 50,000 different
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need your help to put this important
issue on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you can help us petition in
public, if you can help us in our office,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can help us on our phone banks,
if you just want to get the petition just
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can sign it yourself, call us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's that number?
[SPEAKER_02]: Errico 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have voicemail if we're not right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also look at our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's won most of the major website awards
from Netscape, What's Cool, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can print our petition out from
the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch this TV show on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch 100 different videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can get our petition directly
through the internet at www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're going to go into another
segment of our interview with the Dean
[SPEAKER_01]: Emeritus of Oregon Health Sciences
University, Dr. John Benson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Benson was also one of the two
principal co-investigators for the
[SPEAKER_01]: National Academy of Sciences Institute of
Medicine report that was issued in March
[SPEAKER_01]: 1999 called Marijuana and Medicine,
Assessing the Science Base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a real good interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets technical at times, goes into a
lot of the details behind the pharmacology
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis and its use as a medicinal
agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we'll just run right into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the people who are on the panel,
I recall that the Israeli scientist,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think his name is Rafael Nakhon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one who discovered THC about 25
years ago and then discovered the receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: sites, or at least worked on the T-move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worked on those and has also been involved
in some of the endogenous cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural substances we all have in our
brains and bodies, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still very active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, are those comparable to
endorphins or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're a different group of
chemicals, also endogenous though,
[SPEAKER_00]: that use different receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different receptors for the
opioids, morphine and codeine,
[SPEAKER_00]: those two substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the endorphins are among these agents
that help energize the neurons to put out
[SPEAKER_00]: transmitters in various centers of the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabinoids, or the components of the
marijuana leaf, are yet another system,
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacological system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that endogenous system, I think they
call it the endorphin-like substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ananamide, is that the proper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anandamide is the one that is best
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also uses the so-called CB1 receptor,
cannabinoid 1 receptor, such as THC does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another one that's 2AG,
arachidonio glycerol, which is another of
[SPEAKER_00]: these endogenous cannabinoid-like
substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they identified the primary action of
this receptor system?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many actions, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The receptors have been identified and
cloned, actually, and they can be sighted
[SPEAKER_00]: or located in various parts of the brain
that have to do with pain perception,
[SPEAKER_00]: with movement control, with control of
vomiting, with warm and pleasant feelings,
[SPEAKER_00]: with sedation, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very common throughout the
brain.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that there is a definite, what shall we
say, therapeutic action of these
[SPEAKER_07]: substances, would that be?
[SPEAKER_07]: The actions that you mentioned seem to me
to be therapeutic in nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could be therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they might be exploited for
therapeutic uses, that's correct,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are these systems in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason, I'm sure,
that people have found some utility for
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of these cannabinoid substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the president of the Institute of
Medicine asked you to be a co-inventor,
[SPEAKER_01]: an investigator, can you tell us about the
process that led up to the Institute of
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicine conducting this inquiry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy, which is directed by
[SPEAKER_00]: Barry McCaffrey, asked the Institute to
consider such a study and was willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: fund it.
[SPEAKER_00]: About the same time, a major foundation
also thought this would be worthy of
[SPEAKER_00]: study, but the Institute thought it
better, and so did apparently General
[SPEAKER_00]: McCaffrey, if only the one sponsor were
responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a proposal was made to his office
by the Institute staff, which led to a
[SPEAKER_00]: statement of task, so-called, and then the
funding of the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the mandate from the Office of
National Drug Control Policy on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't they exclude, they just wanted the
medical report, nothing to do with science
[SPEAKER_01]: or social science?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, the science, yes, they wanted
the scientific basis for any benefits or
[SPEAKER_00]: harms that might come from the medical use
of marijuana or its component substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were not restricted, but we were
not picked either.
[SPEAKER_00]: To address issues of social, legislative,
regulatory, et cetera, kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would have been a very
different statement of task and a very
[SPEAKER_00]: different group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not have included me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you involved at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the Institute of Medicine
produced a report 15 years before
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding marijuana, not specifically as
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Must have reviewed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely, and I was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in 1982, and it was frustrated by
the lack of clear science, rigorous
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentation, and called repeatedly for
research in various fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, there's been an explosion
of knowledge in the basic science field.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these anandamide and receptor and
neurotransmitters and sighting of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things in various control areas in the
brain have been elaborated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were at a distinct advantage over
the people who did that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope we carried things a bit
further because of that new science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you address that explosion in
science and discovery of the receptor
[SPEAKER_01]: system a bit for our audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it really was the identification of
the receptors themselves, cloning them,
[SPEAKER_00]: sighting them wherever they were found,
both in the brain and peripherally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CB2, the cannabinoid 2 receptor,
is primarily in the immune system and more
[SPEAKER_00]: peripheral nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CB1 is primarily in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: These endogenous cannabinoid-like
substances that I've mentioned were
[SPEAKER_00]: elaborated and a good deal of just
straight pharmacology done on them so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we had the advantage of, oh, for example,
showing the effects in animals on pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: showing the effects on control of motion,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were at a very high level of
understanding the effects of that nature
[SPEAKER_00]: from these basic science advances.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really quite remarkable and
pretty exciting to an internist clinician
[SPEAKER_00]: like myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea they had existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you found that informative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad that we were able to
interview him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in closing here on our show,
don't forget to call us again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to help us out,
put our initiative on the bell at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our phone number is 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, Paul, what will it do in a
little thumbnail sketch?
[SPEAKER_01]: It will regulate the sale of marijuana to
adults in state liquor stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: let people grow their own, let doctors
prescribe it through pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_01]: and finally, allow farmers to cultivate
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'd also, so give us a call at
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to also thank Dr. Philip Levesque
for helping with the interview with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Benson.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the dean emeritus at Oregon Health
Science University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks, Dr. Levesque, who is also,
along with Paul and I, chief petitioner on
[SPEAKER_01]: this petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to help us put this on the
ballot, that's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: The website is www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check out the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a phone call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us out if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, Paul and I and Dr.
Levesque and our whole film crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: we all do this on a volunteer basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really need your help to help change
this marijuana law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So call us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we don't want to sound like pitch
people up here, but many hands make light
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So help us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope you found this informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next week, tune back in for more of
the Million Marijuana March from Seattle
[SPEAKER_01]: and more of this great interview with the
dean of Oregon Health Sciences University,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. John Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, once again, we'll be
informative and we'll be entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching and have a good night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,
[SPEAKER_03]: now everybody's talking about crying,
dying, crying, crying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crying, dying, crying, crying,
crying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crying, dying, crying, crying.
