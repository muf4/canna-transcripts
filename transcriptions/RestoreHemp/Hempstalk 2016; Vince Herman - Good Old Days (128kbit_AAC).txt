[SPEAKER_00]: What's so amazing, man, is there's all
kind of reaper man, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lab testers, man, there's soil
makers, there's lawyers, man, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: people selling tin cans and shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful how it's all evolving,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's more like it used to be now
than it ever has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're going to legalize that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, how many of you feel more
like you do now than when you got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a day about 25 years from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sit down and wonder how.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sit down in the city dump and talk
about the good old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll pass a joint and I'll pass some
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't a good thing coming down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good things went down one time
back in the good old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: There ain't much left that we can figure
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it seems a lot more like that back
in the good old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in love with the people that we
hadn't even met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out for anything that we could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did a thing and we'll do it again
back in the good old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the good old days are passing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good people have done gone on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's a lot for when I'm singing this
song about back in the good old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, folks, these are the good
old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not into the realm of over-regulation
and concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the big boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good things went down back in the
good old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you gotta go, you gotta go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always somebody, don't you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hanging out saying that I told you so back
in the good old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the good old days are passing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good people have done gone on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's a lot for when I'm singing this
song about back in the good old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the good old days are passing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good people have done gone on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's a lot for when I'm singing this
song about back in the good old days.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was for Jack Herrera.
Thank you.
Thank you.
