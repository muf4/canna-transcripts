[SPEAKER_00]: Live at Evolution, it's Cannabis Common
Sense, the show that tells you the truth
[SPEAKER_00]: about marijuana and the politics behind
its prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here's the host of the show,
Paul Stanford and Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: A show that tells you the truth about
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our show is a production of our political
committee that's campaign for the
[SPEAKER_01]: restoration and regulation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are the sponsors of an initiative
petition, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act,
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an initiative petition that our
fellow Chief Petitioner and Treasurer Paul
[SPEAKER_01]: Loney will describe now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks Paul and hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the ballot title that we have for the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act is permit sale of
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana to adults through state liquor
stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: The yes vote permits state licensed
cultivation sale of marijuana for medical
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes and to adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: The summary, which is quite comprehensive
and quite good, so I'll read it here to
[SPEAKER_02]: you folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you don't mind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Replace the state local laws on marijuana
except for driving the influence of
[SPEAKER_02]: intoxicant laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Directs the Oregon Liquor Control
Commission to license marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation by qualified persons and to
purchase entire crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Commission sells marijuana at cost to
pharmacies and medical research facilities
[SPEAKER_02]: for medical purposes and to qualified
adults for profit through state liquor
[SPEAKER_02]: stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% of the net proceeds go to state
general fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smaller percentages for drug abuse,
education, treatment, promotion of certain
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bans sales to and possession by minors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bans public consumption except where signs
permit and minors barred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Provides penalties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again I think the Oregon Cannabis
Tax Act is extremely well written.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a great ballot title.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you folks to help us go out there
and get signatures and get to sign the
[SPEAKER_02]: ballot and vote for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's our phone number, Paul?
[SPEAKER_01]: The phone number is, and we're waiting to
take your call right now, even though you
[SPEAKER_01]: might get voicemail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 2354606.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's in the Portland area.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're outside the Portland area,
you need to dial 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ballot title and summary that Paul
Loney just read is written by the Attorney
[SPEAKER_01]: General and Secretary of State's office to
meet certain statutes and statutory
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements to describe the actual
legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legislation itself is much longer and
more detailed, but that's what they wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's like I say, it's a real
good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we keep driving the influence
and talking its laws because we all
[SPEAKER_02]: believe in, at least all of us who are
volunteering for the Oregon Cannabis Tax
[SPEAKER_02]: Act, that you shouldn't drive on the
influence of anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we want to make sure those laws are
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't want anybody to say at
all we're promoting irresponsible use.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are, and not at all, we are promoting
responsible use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it directs the Oregon Liquor
Control Commission to license marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation for qualified persons and for
them to purchase the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, the regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a well-regulated system that it can't
go awry, that, you know, limit the black
[SPEAKER_02]: market or if not totally wipe out the
black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it would pretty much
eliminate the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not entirely, but I'd say 99.9% of
the black market would be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would license people to grow the drug
for sales to the Oregon Liquor Control
[SPEAKER_01]: Commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oregon Liquor Control Commission would
then put it in their state liquor stores
[SPEAKER_01]: and also the liquor stores would put it in
local bars and shops that have a license
[SPEAKER_01]: that bars the entry of minors so that
people under 21 couldn't come in to a
[SPEAKER_01]: place where marijuana was being smoked
anymore, then they can go into a bar
[SPEAKER_01]: that's serving hard liquor drinks or
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be very similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would tax the recreational sales of
marijuana through these liquor stores and
[SPEAKER_01]: bars, but it would allow untaxed medical
marijuana prescriptions to people through
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacies so that sick people could get
the medicine they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, marijuana is a very useful
medicine in many different conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been used for medicine going back
over 6,000 years, the oldest written texts
[SPEAKER_01]: that talked about different medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the vidas from Northern India
mentioned marijuana for many different
[SPEAKER_01]: ailments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, you know, it's all throughout,
you know, recorded history that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: All societies have used cannabis as a
medicine because they've all found it to
[SPEAKER_02]: be such a wonderful medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even in this century here in the
U.S., we've used it as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the beginning of the century,
all through up to the 1920s, it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: until marijuana prohibition came in that
we stopped using it as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, even now, of course,
the federal government allows a few people
[SPEAKER_02]: to use it as a medicine, you know,
before they put a stop to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it, and it's, you know, people have to
use the entire herb instead of just the
[SPEAKER_02]: pill form of the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government says will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the pill form is just one component
of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are at least three other
medicinal components in marijuana outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the pills have is THC or
tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sold under the brand name Maranol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is just one of the components,
the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also CBD and CBC and a couple of
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is a anti, it's a dilator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lowers blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stops infections and it dilates
bloodways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it lowers blood pressure and bronchial
passageways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the reasons that it's
been useful as a treatment for asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though smoking something doesn't seem
like it would be good for asthma,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is, in fact, been used traditionally
for asthma because it dries up the liquids
[SPEAKER_01]: and it also dilates or makes larger the
passageways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's CBC, cannabichromine,
that's an anti-spastic agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not psychoactive at all the way THC
and CBD are both psychoactive or give you
[SPEAKER_01]: a response that makes you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBC isn't and it's an anti-spastic
agent that stops tremors.
[SPEAKER_01]: People with multiple sclerosis or other
problems find it very, very useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it just goes to show that there's
these multitude of active agents in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and it falls along a lot with
what herbal medicine people talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: when they say you have to take the entire
herb for medicine, that natural pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about taking the entire herb for the
medicine and not just one single
[SPEAKER_02]: component, which is what they wanted to do
with Maranol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this plant has evolved through
literally thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so everything's together and we've
used this medicine that way forever
[SPEAKER_02]: because one part balances out the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have an anti-spasmodic but you
need to be able to transport that to all
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when it dilates it, it gets the
blood flowing much more smoother through
[SPEAKER_02]: the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It transports it to all parts of the body,
to the muscles easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these drugs that we take from the
chemical pharmaceutical industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: the problem is how do we get it from our
stomachs, if we swallow it, to our
[SPEAKER_02]: muscles?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the hardest part they have,
is doing that or some drugs we inject.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, that takes a little quicker,
but normally we just swallow all of our
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs from the pharmaceutical industry and
it's not the same thing as inhaling
[SPEAKER_02]: something because it meets that blood
interface in the lungs and then very
[SPEAKER_02]: easily is transported and very smooth
throughout the entire body.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true and when you look at Maranol,
which is just that single component THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't have the full effects of the
entire herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at that pill, the small
ones, they're 250 milligram ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: are $6 each in pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the larger ones, 1000 milligrams,
those are $15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you're suffering from chemotherapy
as a treatment for nausea and you have for
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer, I mean, you have nausea,
you're gonna throw up two or three of
[SPEAKER_01]: those pills before you get it down and
once you finally do get one of those pills
[SPEAKER_01]: down because it has to go through your
intestinal tract, it takes up to an hour
[SPEAKER_01]: to take effect where about less than a
dime, maybe a nickel's worth of marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: in a legal environment, that two puffs,
and you don't throw up those puffs
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously, and you've lost the nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not throwing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not in agony anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the prohibition of
marijuana as a medicine is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California and Arizona, they passed
medical marijuana initiatives
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelmingly and the federal government
has come in and said that they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: stop doctors from letting that go into
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Okta was written specifically to be
upheld in federal court so that the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal government can't stop it from
taking effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing that, we think that will
allow patients to access medicine much
[SPEAKER_01]: more reasonably through pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna, you know, through Oregon
Chem's tax act, we're gonna say,
[SPEAKER_02]: folks, you know, it's gonna be sold at
cost to patients, to people who have
[SPEAKER_02]: prescriptions from, you know, their
doctor, and so the doctor can treat the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole patient and not have to worry about,
you know, oh, you know, are you be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: get the stuff illegally because there are
doctors out there who will tell their
[SPEAKER_02]: patients with multiple sclerosis that they
have to, you know, you know, I can't give
[SPEAKER_02]: it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really write it down, but you
really should try and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke some cannabis because it has
beneficial effects for people with
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those people there, those people,
if they can smoke the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can live productive lives and they
have no problems holding down jobs and
[SPEAKER_02]: taking care of their family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking care of their home, driving a car,
and all the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they don't have, if it starts to
get to spasms, then they can't keep their
[SPEAKER_02]: job.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't take care of their family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and they're no longer a
productive member of society.
[SPEAKER_02]: They become, quote unquote, a burden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the rest of us have to pay
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our initiative would allow
farmers to grow the drug and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: Central State Commission, would distribute
it at a taxed profit to adults in liquor
[SPEAKER_01]: stores, those over the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'll take it out of the hands
of the black market and remove the profit
[SPEAKER_01]: motive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it will allow doctors to prescribe it
through pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you'd like to help us put this on
the ballot, we need you to call us and get
[SPEAKER_01]: a copy of our petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that by calling us at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the Portland area, 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can call any time we have voicemail
hooked up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So leave your name and address.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, if you have an internet connection,
you can get it on the internet by looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Campaign for the Restoration and
Regulation of Hemp, the name of our PAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: CRRH.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, currently, those pills cost
so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see the people throwing up this
Marinol when just a small amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in a smoked form would ease their
suffering immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the government doesn't want to see
that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They currently classify marijuana as a
schedule one drug with no medical
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But studies have been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, one of them was published in the
Journal of Internal Medicine, where they
[SPEAKER_01]: surveyed oncologists or cancer doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in surveying those oncologists,
they asked them, if marijuana were legally
[SPEAKER_01]: available, would you prescribe it to your
patients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, these oncologists are treating people
who have cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those doctors said, 54% of them said
that, yes, they would prescribe marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: if it were medicinally available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does the government think that it
knows better than these professional
[SPEAKER_01]: oncologists?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cancer doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's because they have an economic
interest in the continuation of
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those same doctors, 54% said they
would prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 48% said they already had.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd already broken the law and
recommended that their patients use
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and get it illegally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in a survey of all of the
oncologists across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's just fabulous that
these doctors are being honest about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out there telling their patients that,
look, I can say, I can't write a
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't give you any.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you should really think about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've had other patients of mine
come in and say, yeah, I was having all
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts of problems until I tried cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these people who are sick,
I mean, they're not out to get high or to
[SPEAKER_02]: get stoned, quote unquote.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're there to be able to feel better,
to be able to function as a normal human
[SPEAKER_02]: being, as a normal adult in our society.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what all of us want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all want to be able to function the way
we can to our best of our abilities and to
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute to our best of our abilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the government just wants to control
so much that they don't let us do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a big thing on control here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government doesn't want us to think
for ourselves, doesn't want people to
[SPEAKER_02]: realize that they can get a drug for
pennies, literally pennies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't take care of lots of problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not a cure-all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a wonder drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one thing that can be used the
entire part for your health regime if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're ill.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely a good tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's one thing that doctors should
have access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently, doctors have to break the
law to recommend it to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they realize that if they prescribe
this little pill that's available today,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's difficult for people who have
not nausea or are having spasms to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: those pills down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those pills are incredibly expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They benefit the pharmaceutical
industries, where by putting marijuana at
[SPEAKER_01]: cost in pharmacies, which is what the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will do,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to make it a lot cheaper for
people who have these illnesses to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in California and Arizona in
November of 1996, those states
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelmingly passed marijuana medical
initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one in Arizona was actually backed by
two former senators, Senator Barry
[SPEAKER_01]: Goldwater, one of the founding fathers of
Republican conservatism, and Senator
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis DeConcini.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them backed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then up in Washington State,
coming up this year, just in another month
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half now, they have I-685,
the Drug Medicalization Act, which will
[SPEAKER_01]: also allow doctors to prescribe marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're watching us up in Vancouver,
we urge you to vote yes on I-685 because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's on your ballot this November,
this year, 1997.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's there for you to take advantage
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live here in Oregon, give us a
call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help us put the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act on
the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get our petitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can call us at 235-4606 if you're
outside the Portland area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stand up for your medical rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And help us get this on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing that this is all
about, about your medical rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about your civil rights, about
choosing to be able to take whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: medications you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing about marijuana and little
pills, if we just stop and think about it
[SPEAKER_02]: for a minute, here's something that
obviously works, and these pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: companies know it works, and the
government knows it works, but instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: just allowing a plant, they transform into
a pill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, why would you even need a pill
when you already have a perfectly good
[SPEAKER_02]: system out there for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't make any sense at all to
me, other than the fact that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously the people can make money off
it, the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just so, to me, it's just part of
the common sense, you know, that we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: need any more surveys or tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: To see where marijuana works as a
medicine, we know it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, why would marijuana be out
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would our government allow marijuana
to be prescribed?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very useful medical preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Paul Loney just pointed out,
it's quite hypocritical to say it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have medical effects when they allow this
pharmaceutical pill that's so expensive to
[SPEAKER_01]: be out on the market, when the inexpensive
herb could replace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope you'll get involved in the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act and try to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: this madness, help us put this on the
ballot by giving us a call today,
[SPEAKER_01]: right away, at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you do any kind of research at
all out there, what the benefits are in
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica, you know, where there's a lot of
Rastafarians that smoke a lot of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, as part of their religion.
[SPEAKER_02]: The women there, they have better
childbirth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have less time and labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The babies come out way more, which is
always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doctors say, oh, it's always good when the
baby's way more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sign of healthy baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: These Rastafarian women, they have shorter
labors, a lot less traumatic, a lot less
[SPEAKER_02]: incidences of having to do cesarean
sections.
[SPEAKER_02]: The babies are healthier when they're
born, you know, less problems in the first
[SPEAKER_02]: few months of their lives that,
you know, that you hear about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, with other babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there, you know, where these people,
you know, consume what the rest of us
[SPEAKER_02]: probably think is an obscene amount of
cannabis, but, you know, they don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: any problems with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Rastafarians are known to smoke
ounces, maybe even four ounces a day if
[SPEAKER_01]: they have access.
[SPEAKER_01]: They smoke it in large cigars and quite
frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they find that that doesn't have a bad
effect in the studies they've done in
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've done some pretty significant
in-depth studies in Jamaica, a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: filling up a couple of books.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to say that there isn't research
showing that medical marijuana is
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial is just a lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a self-serving lie by those who
say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they want to make more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at the, the Marinol
pills that are out there today,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're obscenely expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: $15, up to $15 for a pill, which would be
a nickel's worth of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the economic incentive they
have to keep doing what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just a huge incentive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the fact that with the
Rastafarian women down there in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're taking the dosage in the
way that a naturopathic doctor would want
[SPEAKER_02]: you to, or any doctor, if they stopped and
thought about it, you know, they all,
[SPEAKER_02]: every way down, they smoke it at their own
pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like, okay, I'm going to smoke,
you know, this huge amount in the next
[SPEAKER_02]: half an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they just, you just do it at your own
pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has their own pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on your own body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what, it's a very good
delivery system because they know what
[SPEAKER_02]: their body is going through at that moment
and what it needs and what it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there, you know, with the British
government in control in Jamaica for so
[SPEAKER_02]: long down there, they did all sorts of
research because they were worried about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis getting into Britain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like Paula said,
there was no problems down there at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've had very few problems back in
Britain itself when cannabis got back
[SPEAKER_02]: there big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a very, very, it's a very benign
substance in so many ways, but it's also
[SPEAKER_02]: very helpful, helpful benign substance if
that's not oxymoron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a new study that's being
done in Britain to examine the antispastic
[SPEAKER_01]: qualities of cannabis, how it stops people
who are undergoing convulsions and spasms
[SPEAKER_01]: from things such as multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, it is a test of multiple
sclerosis patients that's just beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: in Great Britain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are many different medical
studies that are taking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The United States government has just
sponsored a new set of studies into the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's no reason to prohibit it today
because it is useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been used medicinally for thousands
of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's prohibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really believe the only reason it's
prohibited is because it's economically
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits small groups of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those people want to make certain that
they continue making all the money they
[SPEAKER_01]: can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helps them to do that by making
marijuana illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would take away another problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would take a big profit center for them
if all these drugs were no longer
[SPEAKER_02]: available or, you know, people wouldn't
buy these drugs so they could easily go
[SPEAKER_02]: down to their local pharmacy and pick up
medicinal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would take a big profit center out of
all the pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd be real upset about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the pharmaceutical
companies are backing Partnership for a
[SPEAKER_01]: Drug-Free America.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Partnership for a Drug-Free
America does almost $2 million worth of
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 95% of those ads talk about marijuana
and how bad marijuana is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at the companies that
are actually putting that information out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, the companies that sponsor
Partnership for a Drug-Free America,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not a big surprise to see that it's a
lot of pharmaceutical drug companies and
[SPEAKER_01]: beer companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily, it's pharmaceutical drug
companies, beer companies, and companies
[SPEAKER_01]: with an interest in the police industrial
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies like Wackenhut that operate
independent, privatized prisons.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are one of the big supporters of
Partnership for a Drug-Free America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eli Lilly, the people who synthesize
Marinol, synthetic marijuana, and make $15
[SPEAKER_01]: a pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one of the big sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anheuser-Busch, the beer makers,
they're one of the big sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these people have a big economic
interest in prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why marijuana is illegal today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't about drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not about the evils of
marijuana, the evils of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about civil rights and civil
liberties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the freedoms that we have out there
for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And be able to choose our own medicine,
choose our own recreational drugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: choose our own products that we can grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will allow
us to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give us a call at 503-235-7000.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can send you out petitions today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if you just get you and three
other friends to sign it, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send it back to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we get 20,000 people to get
five signatures, we'll be on a ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody knows five people who can
sign a petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will sign this petition just to get it
on a ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're asking, is to have a
choice in the ballot November 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we pass, if we win, then you can
have a choice afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because nobody's going to force anybody to
take marijuana as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana will still be there for those
who want to pay that big bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those who don't, marijuana will be
there as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all we're asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all we're hoping that you'll
help us in joining us doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act would
allow medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And prescriptions through pharmacies with
doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would also allow people to grow their
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would limit the recreational use to
those over the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would raise hundreds of millions of
dollars in taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would also legalize industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because marijuana, cannabis hemp,
produces more fiber, produces more
[SPEAKER_01]: protein, produces more oil than any other
plant on our planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly believe that's another one of the
key factors that marijuana is illegal for
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would produce more of these products,
and the companies that produce those don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have to compete with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to urge you to give us a call,
get the petition, get some signatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it might be intimidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because on these petitions, there are 15
signature lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to fill up the whole
petition, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, if you just want to sign one name
on there and send it back in to us,
[SPEAKER_01]: please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you've gotten your signatures,
don't hold on to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them back in to us right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will hopefully turn this in early.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have until next July of 1998 to get the
signatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to get them in as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give us a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're outside of Portland,
it's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or look on our website at www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'd like to take just a moment
to thank Lanny Swerdlow and Evolution
[SPEAKER_01]: Nightclub for helping us put this show on
the air and taping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lanny and Evolution in downtown Portland
have been some of our biggest supporters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to take just a moment to
thank them for they taped the show all at
[SPEAKER_01]: their own expense and get it out there and
put it on the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're very grateful for their help in
doing this and getting the word out to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you know, because we're all
volunteer and that's what's going to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it happen is the volunteer power out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please join us and, you know,
give yourself some more freedoms today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd like to also thank you for
watching our show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been another exciting edition of
Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's been informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: In final closing, we want you to give us a
call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get our petitions at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll even send the petitions in a
brown paper wrapper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that won't have our name on it if you
don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't say anything that is
incriminating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to worry about who sees
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't know who it's from until you
open it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for watching and hope we tune in
next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Thanks, Paul.
