[SPEAKER_01]: So this is called Tent City, and it was
written originally about Nicholsville,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it also speaks for Dignity Village,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too cold for rainbows, too cold for sun,
too cold for downpours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we gonna get one?
[SPEAKER_00]: You better run for cover, rally round that
flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't got a raincoat, got a plastic bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come sit down by the fire, it'll do us
some good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna keep it going long as we got
firewood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too cold to sit down, too cold to stand,
too cold to say hello, but I can shake
[SPEAKER_00]: your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we live now, so come on in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you ain't looking for trouble,
you're welcome, friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull a sleeping bag over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Batten it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep it level so we don't roll out
on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in America, Tent City.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in America, Tent City.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in America, Tent City.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in America, Tent City.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just trickling down,
ain't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, too cold to be living in tents,
too cold to camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to stay dry, everything gets damp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too cold to be living outside,
you can tell it to the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't got no other place to go and the
weather won't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a letter to the mayor to deliver it
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell him it all like I see him down here,
King Good Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's too cold for what you're gonna
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta live somewhere, and you know it's
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't pay the mortgage, can't afford the
rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: After food and bus fare, my money's just
about all spent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a message to the mayor, whisper it in
his ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell him until we see some changes,
we're gonna stay right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in America, Tent City, Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in America, Tent City, Dignity
Village.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in America, Tent City,
Nicholsville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in America, Tent City, all over the
place.
I can't pay the mortgage, can't afford the
rent.
Gotta live somewhere, and you know it's
true.
I can't pay the
mortgage, can't afford
the rent.
Gotta live somewhere, and you know it's
true.
I can't pay the mortgage, can't afford the
rent.
