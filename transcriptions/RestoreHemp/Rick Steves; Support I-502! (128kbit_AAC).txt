[SPEAKER_00]: I am a travel writer, and for me,
Hai is a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a place where my speakers sound
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a place where suddenly I'm a good
cook, where conversations slither around
[SPEAKER_00]: like stray cats, and then once in a while
I like to go there, and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are cases when our government
can say we can't go someplace,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if they say we can't go, there better
be a good reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as I'm concerned, there's no
good reason for our government to tell us
[SPEAKER_00]: we cannot go to that beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, 80,000 Americans are in jail
because they wanted to go to that place
[SPEAKER_00]: called Hai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the responsible adult
recreationally used of marijuana is a
[SPEAKER_00]: civil liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not promoting marijuana,
it's a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not healthy, it can be abused,
it can be addictive, it's certainly not
[SPEAKER_00]: for kids, and if you're caught driving and
intoxicated by anything, as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned, they should throw the book at
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't deny the basic principle
that enjoying marijuana is a civil
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, our government is waging a war,
a long, losing, expensive, demoralizing
[SPEAKER_00]: war against marijuana based on fears and
lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's demoralizing our police force,
it's eroding and corroding necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: credibility among parents and teachers to
teach their children how to get through
[SPEAKER_00]: the threats of hard drug abuse in their
young years, it's wasting billions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, and it's messing up literally
hundreds of thousands of lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: 800,000 Americans were arrested last year
for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not rich white guys, they're poor
people and people of color and people who
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot go through life without marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that burden, this is a scourge on our
society and it's time that we have a new
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I inject a European perspective to
this, and in Europe, a joint is about as
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting as a can of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe has its drug abuse problems,
we have our drug abuse problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in Europe, they measure the
effectiveness of their drug policies not
[SPEAKER_00]: by how many people do you lock up,
but by a concept called harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you minimize harm that this drug
causes to a society?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've found that if you take the
crime out of the equation, take the
[SPEAKER_00]: violence, take the money out of the
equation, then it becomes a health concern
[SPEAKER_00]: and an education challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends in Europe constantly remind me
that a society has to make a choice,
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerate alternative lifestyles or build
more prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the United States, we've decided
to opt for the latter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friends in Europe always follow up
that comment by reminding me that we here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States lock up more people
than anybody else in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lock up eight times as many people per
capita as the Europeans do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either we are inherently more criminal or
there's something messed up about our
[SPEAKER_00]: laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, our drug policy is based on fear and
misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For how long has our government been
spending money on reefer madness
[SPEAKER_00]: propaganda?
[SPEAKER_00]: Consequently, there's a whole bunch of
people that are really afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that think there's
a whole reservoir of people that just
[SPEAKER_00]: think they wish they could ruin their
lives if only it was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in Europe, they've learned that
there is not that reservoir of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: would use marijuana if only it was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Portugal, they decriminalized the
consumption of all drugs 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just did a review of that policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, they like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use does not go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crime is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a little more boring and life
goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of Americans that are also
afraid of this gateway drug notion.
[SPEAKER_00]: One talk of marijuana and you're on the
way to marijuana addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Europe has learned it's not the case
in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been 25 years since they arrested
somebody for smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found is that there's not an
increase in hard drug use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their drug taking population is staying
the same in numbers and it's getting older
[SPEAKER_00]: in demographics because people want to
experiment with drugs, which is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that kids do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do it in their 20s and then they get
over it and they get back on with other
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of things that are exciting to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a way of life in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing gateway about marijuana is
its illegality because when it's illegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: people have to buy it from criminals in
the street who have a vested interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: getting you hooked on something that's
more addictive and more profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take a hard look at our drug
laws and it's so exciting to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: celebration like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempfest is a great celebration of
cannabis culture, but I'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we want to legalize this, we got to
mobilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to stop preaching to the choir and
take it out to the suburbs where people
[SPEAKER_00]: are afraid of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have hardworking advocacy groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a board member of NORML.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been that for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: These groups are fighting a dogged and
difficult campaign on each of our behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not charities, they're services
and they're doing our work for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's some initiatives
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so proud to be a co-sponsor of
initiative I-502.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that this discouragement is a
disappointment to a lot of idealists that
[SPEAKER_00]: want marijuana to be completely free and
legal, but that's not going to pass in the
[SPEAKER_00]: voting booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would pass here, but it's not going
to pass out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need something pragmatic as a first
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please learn about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a smart law.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a law that has elected officials
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a law that's not scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It deals head on with the reasons Prop 19
failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can stay together, we can pass
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-502 has a booth 100 yards right over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over there later on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to get volunteers to get out
there and get signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get 240,000 signatures to get
this thing on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trust me, once it's on the ballot,
it will pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people out there want to know about
driving problems and they want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: about how are you going to retail and all
these boring facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our first step towards legalizing
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can tell your grandchildren
you helped change those laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're at a crossroads in our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the 1930s when courageous
people were stepping up about the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: against alcohol and saying, you know,
this law is causing more problems than
[SPEAKER_00]: it's helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Merrill LaGuardia said back in the
30s, if you've got a law in the book that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't intend to enforce consistently
across the board, the very existence of
[SPEAKER_00]: that law erodes respect for law and
enforcement in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we've got a law in the book that is
eroding respect for law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got no intention of enforcing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they locked us all up, tomorrow would
be one less interesting, less creative
[SPEAKER_00]: place to buy us to call home, wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to know that I'm a hardworking,
kid-raising, church-going, tax-paying
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen of the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I work all day and want to go home
and smoke a joint, that's my civil
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you agree with that, get with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a window with I-502,
all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can get beyond hard on drugs
and soft on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a society, we can be smart on
drugs, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy travels, even if you're just staying
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
