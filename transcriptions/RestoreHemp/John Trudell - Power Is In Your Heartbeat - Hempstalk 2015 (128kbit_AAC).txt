[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're in a situation, we're in a
dimensional reality now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to pretty much improvise as we
go along, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to really be able to effectively
improvise as we go along, we need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do it with respecting the clarity,
respecting our intelligence, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to do it with clarity
because they're fucking with our minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mind-fucking us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's just afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reality is fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's being mind-fucked through
that fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody's going around
reactionary behavior patterns that really
[SPEAKER_00]: are the same thing that's going on,
but they've convinced themselves they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I making sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, so if there's going to be any real
change, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to understand to respect our
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need, it's very important,
it's very, very important that we learn
[SPEAKER_00]: how to like ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most important thing of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because see, if you don't like yourself,
then what the fuck good are you going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do for the rest of the world when it
really comes down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't like myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense, men.
[SPEAKER_00]: But see, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to think because there's too much
muddled going on here that's getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: the way of us having the lives that we are
entitled to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially with what's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, not my generation, I'm of the
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're booking, we're going, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to go on and do our other,
the rest of our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with what's coming here, it's very
important that we need to understand to
[SPEAKER_00]: like ourselves, to respect our
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can talk spirituality all we
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk good guy stuff all we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we don't like ourselves,
what does it mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, back to the part about liking
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, and to me, don't like ourselves,
see, if we're full of fear, doubt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and insecurity, and we just think we're
fucked up, then that means we don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point being, if you look at reality
with clarity, somebody put that in our
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, somebody said it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody told it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't think that up ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I making sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, so, and it's very important for us to
understand that somebody that wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: control us and feed off of us put this
fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, and the fear starts with we don't
like ourselves because we don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: However they put it in there, however,
whatever version of that virus we carry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but our intelligence is the antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, whatever goes on, keep a clear
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, power is very,
power,
[SPEAKER_00]: power comes from us and how we use a clear
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, because I don't know, sometimes I get
confused, because I am multidimensional
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes, and I am crazy, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't trust any of you normal
fuckers at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't understand what power
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power is in your heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power is in your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power is in your heartbeat.
Power is in your heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sends electrical energy and your brain
transmits electrical energy through what
[SPEAKER_00]: is called thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's power.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's power.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are our own power.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the rest of it's whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But power comes from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is about authority, not power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Politics is about authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Military is about authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, all these religions, it's all about
authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we believe, see, we don't think,
anyway, we've been programmed to believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that these things represent power.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, they represent forms of
authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power is an entirely different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, but in the land of deceit,
light of mind, and delusion, and delusion,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
