[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank the folks who have put
this on, from Madeline Martinez and Ralph
[SPEAKER_00]: Martinez, Michael Baccarra, Paul Loney,
Stoney Girls, the folks who sponsor this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you all for coming out here to
represent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is happening in 300 different cities
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a global movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Santiago, Chile, they actually have
450,000 people marching through the street
[SPEAKER_00]: and about 150,000 in Buenos Aires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once in Berlin, they had over a
million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it all started about 45 years ago in
New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're carrying on a tradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always like to say, you know,
we're all motivated by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is something that adds to the
quality of our life and that we enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the current regulations are over
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have farther to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good that some people are not going
to jail for cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some businesses are making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone should benefit from this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to grow fields of it for
its seed without over regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the whole reason marijuana is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs have always just been a smokescreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been about fuel and fiber and
money and power and a continued
[SPEAKER_00]: centralization of economic and political
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, cannabis is the oldest crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: People began cultivating it at least
15,000 years ago and maybe more than twice
[SPEAKER_00]: that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture itself started because of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no other crop that we know of today
was being cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by 12,000 years ago, its cultivation
spread from its indigenous area up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: high Himalayas around Afghanistan and
Tibet and Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had already spread to the Mediterranean
basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were cultivating it in modern day
Italy way before the Romans or even the
[SPEAKER_00]: Etruscans had a civilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis was being cultivated there in
present day Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all around the Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our culture and civilization were based
on a cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we have co-evolved with
cannabis over the past 25, 35,000 years
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've made cannabis evolve for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have evolved for cannabis where
today the protein profile of hemp seed
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly matches humans nutritional needs
for protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And exactly the right balance of amino
acids, the eight essential amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the oil creates essential fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mimics the endocannabinoid system
that was just discovered here in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the oldest crop and it's the
most productive, you know, and the main
[SPEAKER_00]: reason it's illegal is because the
petrochemical, pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_00]: military, industrial, transnational,
corporate elite, fascist sons of bitches
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ruling class gave us the lies,
the racist lies about cannabis using a
[SPEAKER_00]: word from Mexican slang, marijuana that
was used during the Mexican Revolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: War over a hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made it illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had called it hemp, they never
would have made it illegal because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody knew what hemp was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only because they use this new term
and they claimed it was a deadly new drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that caused people to go
crazy and kill their family and friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we see that in our movie,
Reefer Madness and marijuana assassinate
[SPEAKER_00]: youth from back at those times,
but we know that was just malarkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the safest therapeutically
active substance known to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to Francis Young, an
administrative law judge for the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States federal government back 30 years
ago, he's dead now, but he said,
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana is the safest therapeutically
active substance known to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one has ever died from marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you're out here to march for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for turning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be marching out there with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, help us restore hemp.
