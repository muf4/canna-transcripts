[SPEAKER_01]: Can

[SPEAKER_00]: During times of shadow, in the background
of burst, the sun waits for the moon to
[SPEAKER_00]: torch the night, to torch the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the broken neon, and faded light,

[SPEAKER_00]: Her name is Lacey.
[SPEAKER_00]: She makes his crazy kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Want.

[SPEAKER_00]: She wants Want, but doesn't want to.

[SPEAKER_00]: During times of shadow, in the background
of burst, the sun waits for the moon to
[SPEAKER_00]: torch the night, torch the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the breath of sighs, in the magic of
moan, they held them together so as not to
[SPEAKER_00]: feel so alone, so alone, so alone.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.
