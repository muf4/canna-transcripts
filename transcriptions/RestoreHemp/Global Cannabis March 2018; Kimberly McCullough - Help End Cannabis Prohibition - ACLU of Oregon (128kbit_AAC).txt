[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: You feeling good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm really excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super glad to be back here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who don't know about the
ACLU, we are one of the oldest civil
[SPEAKER_00]: liberties organizations in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: National organization is almost 100 years
old now, and we've had an organization
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Portland and in Oregon for over 60
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been working on drug war
issues and on marijuana issues for a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when we were fighting for
decriminalization of small amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana a long, long time ago,
fighting for medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then fighting for recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the fight continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the policy director.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work on legislation at the state
legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also advocate in the city, the city of
Portland, and cities and counties around
[SPEAKER_00]: the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, at the ACLU, we really
believe that the drug war and the war
[SPEAKER_00]: against marijuana that has been going on
for a very, very long time, it's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important civil liberties issues
of our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really one of the most important issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important because it has to do with
people's access to medicine, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly important to all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also has to do with our personal
autonomy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The decisions that we make about our own
bodies and what we do with our own bodies
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we do things with our bodies that
doesn't hurt anybody else, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not hurting anybody else when we
make decisions about using or not using
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a really crucial issue that we
be able to have that freedom, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, the drug war intersects
with so many other civil liberties issues
[SPEAKER_00]: that are important to us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge intersection with racial
justice when we look at the way the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: war has really disproportionately impacted
communities of color in this country and
[SPEAKER_00]: also, frankly, all around the world,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's such a huge intersection,
obviously, with the criminal justice
[SPEAKER_00]: system and with the fact that we've been
locking people up and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for manufacturing marijuana, for selling
marijuana, for using marijuana for far,
[SPEAKER_00]: far too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we have come really far,
and I'd like us to take a moment to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually acknowledge that at least here in
Oregon, we have come really, really far,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we should, like, seriously pat
ourselves on the back, all of us,
[SPEAKER_00]: for that fight, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely amazing, but we also need
to acknowledge and recognize that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: so much farther to go, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Oregon, you know, we at the ACLU,
we dream of an Oregon where insurance pays
[SPEAKER_00]: for medical marijuana, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where people have access to marijuana and
not being able to afford it is not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: stop them from being able to access their
medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We dream of a world where medical patients
and recreational users don't face
[SPEAKER_00]: discrimination in the workplace and in
housing and where we actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: protections against that kind of
discrimination, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what people are doing for medicine
and what people are doing in their free
[SPEAKER_00]: time shouldn't have anything to do with
what they're doing on the job,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where they get to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are huge issues that we need to
fight here in Oregon, but we also have a
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility to fight for legalization
in every single state in this country,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not only that, we need legalization
everywhere in the world, and we really
[SPEAKER_00]: need to take responsibility for the fact
that the United States really has,
[SPEAKER_00]: they took the drug war international,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we brought that mindset to places
where that mindset did not even exist,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a responsibility not only
to change things here, but to change
[SPEAKER_00]: things in the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just really, you know, I'm honored
to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored to be part of this amazing
community of people who advocate for our
[SPEAKER_00]: rights and advocate against cannabis
bigotry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a lot of work to do,
and I'm just here to tell you the ACLU of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon will be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue to fight with you,
and I'm just really, really honored to be
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
