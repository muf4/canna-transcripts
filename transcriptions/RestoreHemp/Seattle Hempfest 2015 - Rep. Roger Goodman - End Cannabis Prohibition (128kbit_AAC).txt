[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, I'm Roger Goodman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the state representative, the chair of
the House Public Safety Committee in the
[SPEAKER_00]: House of Representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis used to be in my jurisdiction
because it used to be illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's in the Commerce Committee
jurisdiction, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have not just the Liquor
Control Board, the Liquor and Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Board officially as of a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of changes happening here in
Washington helping to lead the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's really sort of parallel
universes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot forget what's going on in the
rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some are making more progress than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Washington needs to be careful as we
continue to lead the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far I think it's doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market, the commercial market has a
time to settle down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to worry about people who are
truly medically needy.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who don't want to take the toxic,
petrochemical, pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they depend on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't smoke it or vaporize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's oil and they ingest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm worried about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the legislature, I'm going to
continue to be a voice to take care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: truly medically needy.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, we have, not really on
the other hand, but another issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: major issue, is the market itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new legal market, which so far I
think is a showcase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of flaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet with more retail availability and
sort of a supply and taxation that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, it will take years to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will, again, show the world how it
should be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dam has burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis prohibition is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: The war on marijuana is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll look back on history,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were still fighting it and it still
cost a lot and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the minds of Americans,
and really in the minds of the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: the war on marijuana is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to preside over that, after having been
a drug policy reformer, when I got
[SPEAKER_00]: elected, boy, they hit me hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: My vote went way up after that,
after the people found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people are way ahead of the
politicians and the opinion leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's fun to be ahead of the curve
and to kind of say, I told you so,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm proud to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to HepFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up your voice.
