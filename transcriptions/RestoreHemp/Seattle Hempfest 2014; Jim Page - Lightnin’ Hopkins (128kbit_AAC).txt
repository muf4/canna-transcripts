[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody wrote about my hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: My musical hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got a musical hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be Bob Dylan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got a musical hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a whole bunch of them my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the guy that mattered the most to me
when I was coming up and learning how to
[SPEAKER_00]: play guitar was Sam Hopkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call him Lightning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his professional name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam Lightning Hopkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam was from Texas, from a little town
called Centerville, Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little small town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met him here in Seattle up at the
old Fresh Air Tavern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one could sing the blues like Lightning
Hopkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what anybody said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 15 years old riding by a passenger
window with my radio up against my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I heard him for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting in through the noise of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my whole world went upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to learn to sing and play
guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got on my bicycle with a high-rise
handlebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would ride for 20 miles on a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got every one of his records I could
find back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could sing and play guitar all
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now years later up in Seattle town,
Lightning came through playing three notes
[SPEAKER_00]: in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught up with him early in the dressing
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took out my guitar and I started
playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I named him up a song to tell it right
by the radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the lessons I still had to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And
[SPEAKER_00]: he had to sing for his meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turned him away, he said,
because he was too raggedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He listened to his dark sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he grinned a little more just for
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, now I got money in the bank bag.
And they knew who I am in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't learn to play the blues.
Some
[SPEAKER_00]: people, they pass right through you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they leave a little mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that this world is made of
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: From these stories our songs are grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes another song just gets so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go out and make a song of your
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't learn to play the
[SPEAKER_00]: blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sing and play guitar all night.
Sing and play guitar all night.
