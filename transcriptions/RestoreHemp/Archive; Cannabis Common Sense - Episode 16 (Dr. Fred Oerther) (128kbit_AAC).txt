[SPEAKER_00]: Video taped at the studios of CityVideo at
Evolution, it's time for Cannabis Common
[SPEAKER_00]: Sense, the show that tells you the truth
about marijuana and the politics behind
[SPEAKER_00]: its prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here's the host of your show,
Paul Stanford and Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right over here we have Paul Loney who is
our political committee's treasurer and an
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have Dr. Fred Orther in as a guest
and a long time activist for freedom here
[SPEAKER_01]: in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Paul Stanford.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and this show was brought to you by
our political action committee,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Campaign for the Restoration and
Regulation of Hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all volunteer effort and exists
solely to put the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act
[SPEAKER_03]: on a ballot, which exists solely to get
back some of our freedoms, which allow us
[SPEAKER_03]: to enjoy cannabis recreationally,
hand it out as medicine through
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmacies, and allow our farmers to grow
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act would
allow the state to make some money just
[SPEAKER_01]: the way they make money off beer,
liquor, and tobacco in terms of taxing it
[SPEAKER_01]: through the state liquor store system,
like they do with distilled alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state would license farmers to
cultivate the drug for sales to the state
[SPEAKER_01]: commission, then the state commission
would distribute it at cost to pharmacies
[SPEAKER_01]: and to the liquor stores where they'd make
a profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would also allow farmers to cultivate
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hemp, as many of our viewers know,
produces more fiber for clothing and
[SPEAKER_01]: textiles and paper, and more oil for fuel
and food, and more protein than any other
[SPEAKER_01]: plant on this planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our job here is to stop the war on
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to do that through using
our most powerful tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PIN through the initiative process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need your help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we urge you to give us a call at our
number, which is right there on your
[SPEAKER_01]: screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 235-4607 in the Portland area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're outside of the Portland
area, just dial 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll send you our newspaper and our
petitions, because we want to get you
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different ways to get
involved outside of petitioning,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, including transporting people to
events, data entry, delivering newspapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of all, we want to get you
involved, right, Paul?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very simple to gather signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the other day, Paul and I went out
with a new person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And within half an hour, he had picked it
up and was raring to go the next day out
[SPEAKER_03]: by himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're actually out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're meeting people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good place to people watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing to find out how many
people don't care about their own personal
[SPEAKER_03]: lives out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to look at a signed
initiative, they don't even say no.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even ask what the initiative
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't care about their own political
rights anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just like too involved themselves
to do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that our society has taught us to go
inward and not think about anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Voting is just one way of democracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Democracy is really power in the people
and not two wolves and a sheep voting on
[SPEAKER_02]: the menu, which is what it's become,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it majoritarianism.
[SPEAKER_02]: But politics and voting, you vote a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You vote with dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You vote with your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You vote with your feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You vote with ballots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it comes to it, sometimes in some
jurisdictions, they've voted with bullets.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did here a couple hundred years ago,
1776.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the initiative process is a way to
peacefully participate in the political
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And under the theories that we call our
own, we're supposed to be able to change
[SPEAKER_02]: the rules under which we live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'd like to tell people that
petitioning is one of the most effective
[SPEAKER_01]: and effectiveness-oriented activities that
you can take.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a previous show, I've given this
analogy that I think if you don't exercise
[SPEAKER_01]: your political rights, you lose your
political rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like any other type of exercise,
if you don't do it, you're going to lose
[SPEAKER_01]: that power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at voting, voting is a
very important activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't want to say to denigrate it
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think voting is like lifting a
two-pound weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to write to your
congressman or write to your local
[SPEAKER_01]: newspaper, that's like exercising and
lifting a five-pound weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to get a petition,
though, and circulate it among your family
[SPEAKER_01]: and friends, well, now you're exercising
with a 10-pound weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most effective thing you can do is
to go out in public and meet people you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do it with a group of us,
it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have people tell you how grateful
they are that you're there doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, to me, is like lifting a
100-pound weight in comparison to the
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways we can exercise our
political rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that metaphor.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started petitioning, I wasn't very
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew what I knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I couldn't express what I knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time I had talked to 1,000
people and explained what I was about,
[SPEAKER_02]: I refined my explanation down to a very
few, very succinct, cogent, correct words.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after I'd listened to 1,000 stories,
I knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to respond to people's
concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are their common questions around
this issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it was invaluable political
training.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it was better than going down to
hang out in Salem doing that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: apprenticeship.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you did an apprenticeship this
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to go in there and stop this darn
recrim bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I didn't do enough,
or the fates were lined up against us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be goal-oriented.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't stop Leviathan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't stop the locomotive.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were down there honing your skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were down there putting a little
pressure on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what politics is about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to have you talk a little bit
about something in your intro you talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened when they ended alcohol
prohibition?
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, we had like 13 or 14 years,
29 to 33, to end alcohol prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what did they do at the end of
prohibition?
[SPEAKER_02]: What they did was they set up what I call
non-criminal distribution, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've addressed that in the thing
about the liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish you'd tell me a little bit more
about how that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there has to be non-criminal
distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to have to be that mechanism
somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have to be set up and
worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to have to be made fair and
all of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what would happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A farmer who is interested in cultivating
the drug for sale would get a license from
[SPEAKER_01]: what is currently the Oregon Liquor
Control Commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act,
our initiative petition, changes the name
[SPEAKER_01]: of the OLCC to the OICC, the Oregon
Intoxicant Control Commission,
[SPEAKER_01]: using the term intoxicant to represent
what both liquor and marijuana do to
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we decided to askew the term drugs
because that might include
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anyway, a farmer who is interested
in that would apply for a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state would determine how much it
needs to purchase in a given period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the state would equitably distribute
the license among the applicants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would buy either the maximum
amount the farmer would grow or they would
[SPEAKER_01]: buy approximately the same amount from the
different farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, according to specifically the Single
Convention Treaty, the state has to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Single Convention Treaty is an
international treaty that governs the way
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled substances can be sold by the
signatories and has over 100 different
[SPEAKER_01]: nations that have signed up to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good treaty by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And personally, I'd like to see it
repealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a structure that we first have to
work in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way to repeal it is to go to the
United States Senate and have them repeal
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a real hard job to go to your
100 US senators and get them to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we tried to write our initiative
in compliance with that treaty so that
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd be upheld.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to that treaty, the state has to
collect the entire crop within four months
[SPEAKER_01]: of harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cannabis would be harvested by the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it might be processed into
cigarettes or any one of a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so processors would have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within four months of harvest,
the state would take control of that and
[SPEAKER_01]: then distribute it to pharmacies for
medical need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be at cost for pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be taxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would sell it through the 270-store
liquor store system that we have here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Oregon, we're one of the 26 states
that has a state-controlled store system.
[SPEAKER_01]: For distilled alcohol products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rather than creating a new
infrastructure to comply with these
[SPEAKER_01]: international treaties, we decided to work
within the existing structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the state would take control of it and
put it in the state liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, our initiative allows individuals
to cultivate their own marijuana without a
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also makes it illegal to prohibit
any specific strain of seed or cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wanted to go to your local
garden store and pick out the variety you
[SPEAKER_01]: want or the seed that you want,
the trade in seeds and starts is not
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the trade in the drug is, basically
it's like wine and beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to brew your own beer or make
your own wine, you don't need a license to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to brew enough beer or
make enough wine, to sell, and you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it, then you've got to get a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the government's going to come in and
make certain you're applying the laws that
[SPEAKER_01]: the legislature's enacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that explain it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that's missing here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, in short, a non-criminal
distribution system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the skeleton or the outline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the Single Convention deal with
alcohol as a substance?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's out of the- Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purview of the Single Convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a scheduled drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tobacco also is not a scheduled drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even considered a drug yet,
even though the settlement with the
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco companies- Well, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the US now, the FDA has the authority
to regulate tobacco as a drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should see some interesting things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was health and safety, as somebody
pointed out not too long ago, they would
[SPEAKER_02]: be confiscating the homes and cars and
money of people who use alcohol and
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco or who buy and sell alcohol and
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the prohibition approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have chosen not to do it at all
as far as tobacco is concerned until
[SPEAKER_02]: recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's 400,000 deaths a year,
according to mortuary statistics?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 400,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Far more than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alcohol, you get 100,000 deaths a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for marijuana, zip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zilch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you believe their numbers,
all illegal drugs put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's less than 5,000, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because very few people actually die from
illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They die from poor nutrition because
they're doing illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pharmaceutical drugs, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 20,000 to 50,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing, though,
pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have poor nutrition, and they're
doing pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's from all the side effects that
the impurities that they mix with these
[SPEAKER_03]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even these days with cannabis,
you never know what sprayed on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: For anyone who's a consumer out there,
that's the scary part.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know what somebody sprayed on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in light of that, I'd like to point out
that the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act takes
[SPEAKER_01]: that into consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis that is sold has to be graded
and tested for adulterants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the packages have to say what
adulterants, what additives are included
[SPEAKER_01]: in that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at tobacco, we all know they
put saltpeter in there to make them burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually put a little bit of ammonia
in there to release the nicotine and make
[SPEAKER_01]: it pass through the blood air membranes in
your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put in, I've heard upwards to,
I don't know, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: 400 different chemicals in a tobacco
cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll never find that written on any
pack of tobacco cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they do is they chop it up,
and they put it into a sludge,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they add a bunch of stuff to it,
and then they dry it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, according to the Oregon Cannabis Tax
Act, if they wanted to do something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that with cannabis, they'd have to list
every single additive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would have to warn of the health
danger of any that have harmful effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: known harmful effects to human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought it on themselves,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was a kid, 50 years ago,
we all called cigarettes, we're called
[SPEAKER_02]: coffin nails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knew that one cigarette took a
day off your life, or an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knew that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was common knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was vernacular proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've gotten away with that for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They run that scam, but science hasn't
proven well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, nobody asks science.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ask Schills, and Schills said,
oh no, there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have not treated tobacco very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing I find historically interesting
about alcohol prohibition is we had
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition from 29 to 33.
[SPEAKER_02]: And historically, to me, it looks like for
the next 50 years after alcohol
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition was repealed, that the public
attitude was so bad about anybody that
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about alcohol that we couldn't
publicly recognize that hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of people were dying or being
injured in drunk driving accidents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year, the people were dying of
cirrhosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that brought these problems up
were ignored because of that 13 years of
[SPEAKER_02]: moral grandeur that they called alcohol
prohibition with gangs, with increasing
[SPEAKER_02]: federal enroachment into the lives of
private citizens, and also into local
[SPEAKER_02]: politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The feds got big into local law
enforcement and politics in prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took 50 years before society as a
whole and our rulers as a group could
[SPEAKER_02]: begin to address the problem of alcohol
consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it wasn't just that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think because if you look back when they
repealed prohibition, it was a two-part
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: As usually the government always gets a
second part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part number one, repeal prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part number two, there was to be a massive
education campaign to the American public
[SPEAKER_03]: about the dangers of abuse of alcohol,
which is to be funded by the alcohol
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was the agreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the next day, they axe part B.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the real problem was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why the abuse to this day
reigns with alcohol, which is why among
[SPEAKER_03]: our children, that's the highest drug they
abuse is alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with the Oregon Campus Tax Act,
it's a different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we wrote the tax act to specifically
distribute the profits and the taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be the state's windfall when
they tax and regulate the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, marijuana is the number one
cash crop here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Oregon, it's the number one cash
crop by probably the largest factor in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States, with the possible exception
of Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Oregon, we have one of the highest
per capita production rates of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What our initiative will do is it would
bring in that money out of the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market and put it on the table for all of
us to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the state would have a share in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1989, the DEA said that that was $2.6
billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price of marijuana has about doubled
since 1989.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might have gone up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe production's gone down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to gauge these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's say that we could bring in 20%
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could bring in 20%, of $2.6 billion,
we're talking $500 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: That by far dwarfs the amount of money
that's coming in from the lottery.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lottery proceeds are projected over
two years, where this would just be a
[SPEAKER_01]: single year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over a two year biennium, as our financial
and physical statements are made by state
[SPEAKER_01]: government, we'd be talking about a
billion dollars, or maybe a tenth or more
[SPEAKER_01]: of total state revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Paul, I thought you were going to
get into the fact that Oregon Campus Tax
[SPEAKER_03]: Act put all that aside, that we direct
money to go into treatment programs,
[SPEAKER_03]: education.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what the money figures
are, because people will always argue with
[SPEAKER_03]: us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can point the fact that we're
going to direct proceeds to treatment
[SPEAKER_03]: programs, education programs, so that
people will be able to get help if they
[SPEAKER_03]: want help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 90% of the proceeds would go into
the state general fund as revenue for
[SPEAKER_01]: state programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then 8% would go into drug treatment
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, alcoholics and addicts are
turned away 90% of the time when they seek
[SPEAKER_01]: help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually they only can get that help
after they've been found guilty of some
[SPEAKER_01]: other crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our initiative would increase
funding for that by several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 8% of the total proceeds would go into
substance abuse treatment programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1% would go into funding and creating a
comprehensive and realistic drug education
[SPEAKER_01]: program for kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final 1% would go into a
state agricultural committee to promote
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since hemp has been repressed,
and many people, myself included,
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that the whole marijuana smoke
screen, pun intended, was created to
[SPEAKER_01]: divert attention away from the fact that
hemp produces more fiber, protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: and oil than any other crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that 1% of the proceeds from the
profit of the sale of the drug going to
[SPEAKER_01]: reestablish this vital and sustainable
industry is quite appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it will help put Oregon on the
cutting edge of exciting new developments
[SPEAKER_01]: and technologies that are truly
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I believe that just as we
can't throw out all sorts of wild numbers
[SPEAKER_03]: about tax proceeds coming from this,
we don't know what the industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: market would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's been so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been caught up in this cult of
modernity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We said, OK, now we can have petroleum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can have plastics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have cotton.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people were so excited by new modern
things, they forgot hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because hemp also became, that was for the
low class.
[SPEAKER_03]: People wore hemp clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The upper classes wore silk and then
cotton.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it became sort of this thing that
only the lower class people would wear it
[SPEAKER_03]: and would use it as a fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then only lower class people would use
it as an intoxicant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we have to get back away
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either that or we all got a cop to be in
low class people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bet we're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've got to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, what hemp can do for us,
we've forgotten.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's to be even a halfway chance of
saving the remaining trees and putting the
[SPEAKER_02]: farmland into useful service, hemp is the
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until about 140 years ago, over 90% of all
the world's paper was made from hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, remember, 140 years ago,
there was very little paper in this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot less.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when people start throwing those
numbers around, I just want to put that in
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective that we just don't know what
industrial hemp will do for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we haven't used it in so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my household is, now we're active.
[SPEAKER_02]: We read a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We write a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're jacking out the equivalent of 20
foot of tree every two weeks in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: newsprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three foot of newsprint is 20 foot of
tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every two weeks, we're firing out a 20
foot of tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm appalled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we cut down and we recycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just appalled between the mail,
the newspaper, and then the computer
[SPEAKER_02]: paper, and the advertisements,
the stuffers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that much thick clay paper in the
Oregonian when it comes by.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shiny stuff weighs almost as much as
the paper itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a tremendous amount of trees
going up the chimney that need not.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other sources of pulp and fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some numbers that I do like to refer
back to are the United States Department
[SPEAKER_01]: of Agriculture studies that were done at
the turn of this century.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1916, the US Department of Agriculture
began looking at hemp herds, which were
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionally a waste material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp was traditionally grown for the bark,
or the bast fiber, that's the outer part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interior part of the stalk,
the hemp herds, were a waste material that
[SPEAKER_01]: was used as animal bedding, or sometimes
burned as a fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the introduction of the
decorticating machine at the turn of this
[SPEAKER_01]: century, that waste material could be
collected much more efficiently than it
[SPEAKER_01]: could previously be done when it was the
bast fiber was separated by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1916, the United States Department of
Agriculture did a bulletin, USDA Bulletin
[SPEAKER_01]: 404.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name of that bulletin was Hemp Herds
as a Paper Making Material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that, they said to provide a mill
that makes 100 tons of paper a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: By today's standard, 100 tons of paper a
day is a very small mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by those standards, it was an average
mill back at the turn of this century.
[SPEAKER_01]: To provide that mill, with enough trees to
feed the mill, would take 40,500 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: To provide that same mill with this waste
product from producing hemp bast fiber and
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp seed, oil and protein, would take
just 10,000 acres under cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's according to the US Department
of Agriculture's Bulletin 404.
[SPEAKER_01]: Admittedly, it's a dated document,
and agricultural techniques have improved
[SPEAKER_01]: since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those techniques haven't been in
practice with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really don't know what it would do
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to get back, it's time to experiment
once again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And pun intended there, once again,
we have to experiment with hemp to find
[SPEAKER_03]: out what it can do for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have forgotten as a society.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's time to say, OK, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we have the Oregon Cannabis
Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: Asking folks out there to get out there
and petition.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fun thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get out with friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing how quickly time goes by
and how many signatures you can get in a
[SPEAKER_03]: hurry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If nothing else, get your family to sign
this and your few friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the best thing to do is come out and
petition at some summer event,
[SPEAKER_03]: concerts, waterfront parks, or at malls.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also out there now the Oregon
Drug Control Amendment put out by the
[SPEAKER_03]: American Anti-Prohibition League.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a referendum on the
recriminalization bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So help us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's our phone number?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now's the time to get active.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's our phone number?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our phone number, which is on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should call it, if you're in the
Portland area, is 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're outside of the Portland area and
you're watching this, it's 1-503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're on the internet,
you can just pull our petitions and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything off the web at www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get those petitions, because that's the
way you can have a real impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the most highly effective
activity you could take to stop the
[SPEAKER_01]: buildup of coercive police power in
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And initiatives, all these so-called
political consultants and politicians in
[SPEAKER_03]: Salem themselves say that if you get
something on a ballot, that's when they
[SPEAKER_03]: pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like what happened last time with the
Oregon Clean Stream Initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got on a ballot, but it lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Governor Kitzhaber, they had to do
something this year because it was on a
[SPEAKER_03]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this will do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will tell the folks in Salem that
we're serious about this, taking back our
[SPEAKER_03]: freedoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can't do it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I often hear the question,
what are you going to do to legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're not going to do it by
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all in this together, and it's going
to take all of us to stop this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to take us going to our
family and friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take us getting petitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been another exciting edition of
Oregon Thanks, Dr. Fred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tax Act and Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming, Fred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for doing it, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
Let's do it.
