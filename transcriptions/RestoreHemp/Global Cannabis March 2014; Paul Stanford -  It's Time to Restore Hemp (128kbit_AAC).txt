[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most productive crop,
produces more fuel from its seed oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: its biomass and ethanol, more fiber from
its stems for canvas, rope, lace,
[SPEAKER_00]: linen, paper, building materials,
and more food from its seeds, the best
[SPEAKER_00]: protein known to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to take the oldest and most productive
crop and to prohibit that one is evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're here to protest that,
to restore hip to its rightful place in
[SPEAKER_00]: our economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look right up there where that Mark
Emory sign is being held, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: starting point of the march.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start when we come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congressman Earl Blumenauer will be here
to give our keynote speech and a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: other speakers of music for a few hours
this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I want to thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Line up for the march and help us restore
hip.
