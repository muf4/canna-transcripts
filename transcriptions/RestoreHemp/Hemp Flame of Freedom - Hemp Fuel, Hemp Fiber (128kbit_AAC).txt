[SPEAKER_00]: As long as people are just being locked up
for cannabis, then we've got to change
[SPEAKER_00]: those laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got to restore hemp for energy,
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real key here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole reason marijuana was prohibited
was to stop this, to stop hemp fuel being
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is hemp seed oil with a piece of
hemp twine here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is next week's wick right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can burn this in any diesel engine
with no conversion to the engine today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pour that right into your diesel
engine and turn the key and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason it was made illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the petrochemical, pharmaceutical,
military, industrial, transnational,
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate, elite, crony, capitalist,
ruling class that have brought us hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis prohibition.
