[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joining us today is the leader of
California's normal, Del Gehringer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he has quite a fight on his hands
dealing with a variety of changes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring in his state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with it being one of the largest
states in the United States, I think maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: it is the largest, Texas might be in
there, he has the need to find more
[SPEAKER_00]: members and the need to get a message out
to the rest of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the politics that California normal
focuses on focuses a lot when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: at least the hemp movement on the medical
aspects, isn't that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have with the recent victory in
San Francisco with Proposition P has put
[SPEAKER_01]: that to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, what public figures do we
have out there who are willing to pick up
[SPEAKER_01]: the ball when 80% of the people of San
Francisco say it's time for a change on
[SPEAKER_01]: the issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, it's amazing how politicians have
been pussy fitting about it, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: very happy to see that the city officials
of San Francisco, including the leading
[SPEAKER_01]: candidates for mayor, mayor Art Agnos,
and former police chief Frank Jordan,
[SPEAKER_01]: and other city officials have expressed
nothing but support for Proposition P. And
[SPEAKER_01]: not only that, we found that by putting
Proposition P out there, we were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: give them an issue that they felt good
about supporting, that they didn't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: run and hide from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think it's time to bring that out
to some of the other leaders in
[SPEAKER_01]: California, particularly in the
legislature and in Congress, and get the
[SPEAKER_01]: ball rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've come out to Nation's Capitol
shortly after, it was only like three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four days since Prop.
[SPEAKER_00]: P passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a week, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've arrived here just as quickly as
the message that that proposal being
[SPEAKER_00]: passed sent to our Nation's Capitol.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think Congress and the Senate
is starting to react to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's going to take the
attention of national candidates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's up to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to ask actually have to go to
Capitol Hill where I was the other day,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm going again on Monday,
and other people have to be doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: too, talking to their Congress people and
urging them to take a position on this
[SPEAKER_01]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, one of the key leaders in all of
Congress and among the Democrats on the
[SPEAKER_01]: issue of medical marijuana is an important
legislator from California, Henry Waxman,
[SPEAKER_01]: from Los Angeles, who has, I must say,
had a very good record in voting against
[SPEAKER_01]: repressive drug legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been in a minority, a very small
minority of people who have opposed,
[SPEAKER_01]: who've actually voted no on these crime
bills that come down, like the latest
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenon of this crime bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is also the head of the Health and
Environment Subcommittee that deals with
[SPEAKER_01]: how drugs get regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA drugs and Health and Human Services,
which is making the decision on medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it behooves us to tell Mr. Waxman,
I hope his constituents will tell him,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they would appreciate it if he
started holding hearings on the issue of
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think by doing so, he would have
the opportunity to really score some
[SPEAKER_01]: important points that have to be scored
and affect some change very quickly,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there will be popular support for
this, and there's no reason that he
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't undertake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hope that people will talk to Waxman
and others urging this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now, you and I, being together from
California, I'm not a native there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm native from Indiana, but I've spent
the last four or five years living in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state, know that smoke adjoint,
lose your license, seems to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: importance to that state, and we got to
deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, it's on the agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: California has got to act on smoke
adjoint, lose your license, by October
[SPEAKER_01]: 1993, or we start losing federal highway
funds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've got two options.
[SPEAKER_01]: We either enact smoke adjoint,
lose your license, which is an automatic
[SPEAKER_01]: six-month driving license suspension for
any drug offense, any drug offense,
[SPEAKER_01]: including personal possession of
marijuana, regardless of whether it's on
[SPEAKER_01]: the road or not, or we can reject it by a
joint resolution of the legislature and
[SPEAKER_01]: the governor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the legislature does not care for
smoke adjoint, lose your license,
[SPEAKER_01]: as does the majority of California public,
an all-informed opinion in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Sacramento Bee, the San Jose Mercury,
have editorialized against this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nobody I've heard yet who's spoken
up in favor of it, other than,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, the Orange County Board of
Supervisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then why is it still in existence?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have, because the legislature has
to get agreement from the governor on what
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we have a governor who announced that
he was in favor of recriminalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana, and so the universal assumption
has been, well, gee, Pete Wilson is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to veto any attempt to pass an override
resolution to smoke adjoint, lose your
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that Pete Wilson's position is
very ill-informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really hasn't thought through the costs
of this proposal, because you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have thousands, tens of thousands of
marijuana offenders who now, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: get a ticket for smoking adjoint in the
park are going to be coming, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting driver's license suspension.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're going to get lawyers
they're going to get trials, public
[SPEAKER_01]: defenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is going to cost the state
tens of millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is so stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone realizes it is so stupid to give
six months' driver's license suspension
[SPEAKER_01]: for somebody who has a joint in their
purse in the airport, and yet you can
[SPEAKER_01]: drive drunk and get only a four-month
driver's license suspension in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, which is worse, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but if they enact the tax situation
that they've got on the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the tax issue is essentially a
separate issue, whether they should also
[SPEAKER_01]: put a penalty tax on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been beaten back, and I don't
expect it to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have to fight it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Senator Davis had a proposal in which he's
headed for many years to put a controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: substances tax on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they catch you with drugs of any
kind, they could say, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you didn't pay the tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tax was going to be $500 per
ounce, $500 per ounce of crack,
[SPEAKER_01]: $500 per ounce of LSD, $500 per ounce of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: But $500 was not really what you'd pay,
because that was the tax only if you paid
[SPEAKER_01]: it in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they caught you not having paid it,
which is what they fully expected,
[SPEAKER_01]: then there would be a penalty,
and it would be $5,000 an ounce,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ed Davis admitted himself this is just
another way of expanding the state's
[SPEAKER_01]: forfeiture powers, all right, so that if
there's a lot of cash, we can get the
[SPEAKER_01]: guy's money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this passed the Senate unanimously in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of senators voted for it knowing it
was a bad bill, but thinking that the
[SPEAKER_01]: assembly would knock it down, which it has
in previous years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it got loose in the
assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't go through the same legislative
channels it did last year, and it almost
[SPEAKER_01]: passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were able to alert the important
decision makers about that, and it got
[SPEAKER_01]: scotched at the last minute, and I don't
think it's going to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this shows the importance of watching
your public policy makers, your decision
[SPEAKER_01]: makers, your city council.
[SPEAKER_01]: These proposals come up, and if you aren't
aware of them, I mean, they can sail right
[SPEAKER_01]: through, but when you say something,
you can have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say we have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm calling you from Los Angeles,
and I want to know what can I do to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do as an individual?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, from Los Angeles, first of all,
if you haven't done so already,
[SPEAKER_01]: please write to your state senator and
your state assemblyman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look them up in the phone book or from
your board of elections if you don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: who they are, and write to them saying to
vote against, smoke a joint, lose your
[SPEAKER_01]: license, and to support an override.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also write a letter to Pete Wilson,
which was going to be ignored and probably
[SPEAKER_01]: put in a big pile of letters and weighed
or something like that, but do it anyhow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, because if they get lots of
tons of mail, I mean, nothing else does
[SPEAKER_00]: make a state bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me say state legislators don't
get all that mail on a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, AB 101, the gay rights issue,
got a lot of mail, but often they'll only
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, four or five letters on a
particular bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then what else can we do that'll
make a difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing you can do is go out and
when you meet candidates, like at
[SPEAKER_01]: candidates' nights, you know, when your
local congressman comes in town and has a
[SPEAKER_01]: public meeting, ask him his stand on that
law, on smoke a joint, lose your license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask him his stand on medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you might even ask whether
people have a right, Americans have a
[SPEAKER_01]: right to smoke marijuana in the privacy of
their personal lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't ask them to take a position on
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: No politician is going to say yes to that
at this particular moment, so let's not
[SPEAKER_01]: waste our breath, but let's focus on
what's at hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's medical marijuana, it's smoke a
joint, lose your license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about more of that when we
come back right after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: With us today is the head of California
Normal, Dale Gehringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale, we have some elections coming up in
1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always have elections coming up,
but the candidates in 92 are the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're focusing on primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a voter who's concerned about
getting the propositions that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: taken care of and into office and
implemented, I want to be able to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: how my candidate votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to find out his
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to find out how I can
make a difference when I get ready to cast
[SPEAKER_00]: my ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Joint California Normal and
California Normal Reports makes a point of
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you the information about how
people are voting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been following people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting votes have been occurring
in California, and people are not very
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the smoke a joint, lose your
license vote was a particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a vote that was taken by Congress
to force the states to change their laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was specifically aimed at marijuana
decriminalization by Bill Bennett and
[SPEAKER_01]: Senator Alphonse D'Amato and
Representative Jerry Solomon, well-known
[SPEAKER_01]: right-wing reactionaries from back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who voted for it in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all the Republicans did,
with the exception of Tom Campbell,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's running for Senate.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the Democrats did, too,
though, including some supposedly very
[SPEAKER_01]: liberal ones, a notable one being Barbara
Boxer, who is running for Senate also,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same Senate seat, from San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Barbara Boxer fancies herself to be an
advocate of civil rights and personal
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom and abortions rights and our right
to control our own body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she makes a very vociferous show of
being pro-choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you ask her about marijuana,
she says, well, you know, I don't think it
[SPEAKER_01]: should be legal, and I don't think people
should go to jail, but it shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: legal to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she defends her vote on smoke a joint
and lose your license on no particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: good rational grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's basically a prohibitionist.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't like drugs at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said she'd like alcohol to be illegal
if, you know, if that would help things
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it sounds more to me like she was
trying to stop personal rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we tried, so we told, I mean,
the obvious contradiction here is here's
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who says she's pro-choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's pro-abortion.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's not pro-choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we confronted her with that at a
couple of fundraisers for her,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we approached her and we,
the people in her campaign are people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are friends of ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: They agree with us on these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know that Barbara Boxer had
this position until we went up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Democratic Convention in Oakland and
talked to them, to fundraisers and talked
[SPEAKER_01]: to them and said, do you know how Barbara
Boxer is on marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, an incident that happened just a
couple of months ago before the recent
[SPEAKER_01]: tragic death of Bill Graham.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Graham had a fundraiser for Barbara
Boxer up in his beautiful Marin home,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a psychedelic museum of,
I'm just thrilled that I was able to see
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm glad I met Bill Graham too before
he passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went up there along with Ed
Rosenthal and Eric Harlow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We paid a hundred bucks to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a nice party there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went around and circulated and
talked about things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went up to Barbara Boxer, introduced
myself, tried to make overtures and she
[SPEAKER_01]: said, well, she didn't agree with us on
the marijuana issue, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went over and talked to Bill
Graham and Ed Rosenthal buttonholed him
[SPEAKER_01]: and we told Bill Graham the story and Bill
Graham said, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbara Boxer doesn't understand weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to tell her about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, the afternoon went on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbara Boxer gave a speech in which he
went on about civil liberties and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else, said wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to agree with everything she said in
her speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: She never mentioned drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Went on to a fundraiser auction.
[SPEAKER_01]: First prize in the auction, four tickets
to the New Year's Eve Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_01]: concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbara Boxer's holding up these tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey now, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the hottest tickets in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got to go to the Grateful Dead
concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she seems to have two different codes
is what you're getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anyhow, after all of this happened,
Bill Graham finally came up to say what he
[SPEAKER_01]: had to say and it was very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, well look, I really agree with
99% of Barbara Boxer's positions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have to say there's one thing I
disagree with her on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't want to talk about
drugs, but it's been 500 years since we
[SPEAKER_01]: came to this continent and people still
aren't free to plant the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now do we have some kind of lobby going
in California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have a, well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Norma involved with the lobby?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to do that and I have friends and
there's a network of people who work on
[SPEAKER_01]: particular representatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all volunteer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all volunteer, but we have phone
trees which need to be developed,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially I would say in Southern
California, so that we can get phone calls
[SPEAKER_01]: through to a legislator's office if a key
vote is going on and saying, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: we care about this vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's an important thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If smoke a joint to lose your license
comes to a vote, we want people phoning
[SPEAKER_01]: the Senate Judiciary Committee on the day
of that vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll let people know when that comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because oftentimes the people that
are making these statements and making
[SPEAKER_00]: these policies have a multi-million dollar
budget to work with for their campaigns
[SPEAKER_00]: and are able to have, you know,
press releases put together for them and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people who are opposing these
particular viewpoints are coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: their heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working class heroes and are
working on a budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to find some way to work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you suggest when it comes to that
state and size of California?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you pull us together?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real tall order, and we're a long
way from having a single organization,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you're aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a network of groups in California
that I think we're just going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep developing for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see, you know, many different people
working in many different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a county by county basis,
and different counties have their
[SPEAKER_01]: expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to handle Sacramento affairs
and, you know, press relations and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep people informed through the
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: As for, you know, more developed
organization time, we'll bring that or it
[SPEAKER_01]: won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may not even need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is important for us to get actively
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how is it that normal makes its
policies when it comes to supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: various groups and various proposals and
amendments going through the state?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it that you make your selections?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an awful lot going on out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not that many issues that are
strictly marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's usually about two or three bills a
year in the legislature that really deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's status quo, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically we get in there to try to
oppose bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every year there's a bad bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple years ago, for instance,
there was a bill by when Bandicamp was
[SPEAKER_01]: still attorney general.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to establish 10 plants as the
absolute limit for personal use
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody who was caught with more than
10 plants is an automatic felon,
[SPEAKER_01]: not eligible for diversion regardless of
whether they're a medical patient or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody who knows anything about
cultivation knows that's completely
[SPEAKER_01]: unrealistic and not what personal use is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically we're the only people who
know about personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legislature doesn't, and neither does
law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by going to the legislature and
just talking to the people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsoring this bill and explaining,
well, look, this has nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get into all sorts of
lawsuits on this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is unreasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Debunking the statistics because they had
a cop come in and try to say that one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant grows a kilogram of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, one plant on a government
marijuana farm with no helicopters above
[SPEAKER_01]: it may grow a kilogram of marijuana,
but we know that's not the way marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: is grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We convinced the committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't hard to do because we did have
the facts on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bills like that, you know, don't come
around that often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it comes to focusing your
energies too, you have to be very select
[SPEAKER_00]: in the type of people that you send as
front people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, you're also focusing
on groups and the muscle behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who does most of the structuring
throughout the state?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've had it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it organized?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it done by large cities?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a lot of people like in LA?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a network.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a network of people that we phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of whom are official members of
California Normal, which has a very
[SPEAKER_01]: indefinite structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The indefinite structure is not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have bylaws, but we're probably
going to have some reorganization of our
[SPEAKER_01]: own just as national normal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got about a minute left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you had the opportunity to say one
thing that was most important to the
[SPEAKER_00]: California citizens, as well as those
people across America who are seeing this,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would be your statement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think you have to really demand of
your Congress people and your elected
[SPEAKER_01]: officials to stand up for your right as an
American citizen to smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got to state it in those terms
and raise the issue whenever you encounter
[SPEAKER_01]: them, whenever you confront them,
ask them to state their stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been trying to get you on
the show for a long time, and it's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have you back again as soon as
we can work it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a pleasure to have you tune
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a chance to make a difference
in your community, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out and find some change that you can
contribute to and make somebody's life
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we get together again, keep happy,
keep strong, keep wise.
Thank you.
