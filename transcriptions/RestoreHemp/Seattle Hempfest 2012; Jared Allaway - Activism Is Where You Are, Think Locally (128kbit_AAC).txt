[SPEAKER_00]: I was just over at the symposium stage
doing a panel with some other canvas
[SPEAKER_00]: activists and we're just talking about
things you can do to become an activist
[SPEAKER_00]: and Ben from the CDC mentioned that Nora
Callahan Says that activism is where you
[SPEAKER_00]: are and I think that's really important
You got to think local and think simple
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big sign with Six words five
words, you know, it's simple You have to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out something inside yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I help?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way you can do that is by
taking first steps You can't be afraid you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be willing to experiment and I
tried making t-shirts and I wasn't very
[SPEAKER_00]: good at first practice makes perfect So
try different things experiment find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're good at find something Inside
yourself that lets you help someone else
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than yourself Right now I'm working
with the Cannabis Child Protection Act 514
[SPEAKER_00]: it would allow Adults 21 years of age and
older to grow a 20 by 20 garden
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana It would also
require video proof of impairment before
[SPEAKER_00]: blood could be used against you in a DUI
We're collecting signatures all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place We're just behind McWilliams stage
just down the road a little ways We need
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need volunteers to help us gather
signatures So look for 514ccpawah.org.
