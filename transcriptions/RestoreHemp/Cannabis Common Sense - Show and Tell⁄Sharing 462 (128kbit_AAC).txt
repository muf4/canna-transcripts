[SPEAKER_00]: These are all newly acquired, freshly
opened, nifty little things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a corn, the first two are corn
removers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from jeans and it's ether and
cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says right there, close in on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this says it's a non-proprietary
formula of salicylic acid or aspirin and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis indica, which it says is poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the formula and it's a
medicated, elastic adhesive ectoplast corn
[SPEAKER_00]: rings to rip out corns and other nasty
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a couple of different chloride and
neurologic medicines, but this one has
[SPEAKER_00]: morphine, extract of cannabis indica,
nitroglycerin, peppermint, just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of peppermint in there to add a little
flavor, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nifty little label, multi-color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Independent Pharmaceutical
Company of Worcester, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at about 1890.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's embossed on the back with IPCo,
the name of the company and nifty little
[SPEAKER_00]: poison thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next door we find Schifelin's neurologic
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cannabis and opium and other nifty
things from Schifelin's in Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also is a neurological medicine and
it's from Park Davis of Detroit,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is opium extract and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of other little things in there
and that's from Park Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this last one is tonight's piece de
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's powdered extract of Indian cannabis
from Park Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about half full.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, we might call it Keef.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is circa 1880 powdered extract of
cannabis, powdered hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I say, it's about half full.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a thing on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a pretty nifty one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nice writing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's owing to the character of this drug
and it's a powder equal medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a narcotic like opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It relieves pain and spasms but does not
diminish the appetite or check the
[SPEAKER_00]: secretions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from Park Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you call really cured,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's been cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely aged cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not ever going to open this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a valuable antique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my understanding is that it degrades
at about 10% a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since it's about 120 years old,
it was gone a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time has passed.
