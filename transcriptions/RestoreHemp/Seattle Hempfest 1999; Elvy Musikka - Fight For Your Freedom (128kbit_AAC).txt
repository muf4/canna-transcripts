[SPEAKER_00]: And so another question we have here is
for Albie Musica, which is how the hell
[SPEAKER_00]: did you get into the federal government to
give you free medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it took 12 years of educating
doctors, as every patient must do,
[SPEAKER_00]: is let the doctors know what medicine
they're taking if they're not aware that
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana is a medicine, whether they want
to hear it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I had to do, and it was
certainly helpful when I was arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meanwhile, I had to try every
kind of medicine available for glaucoma
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was sad because at the very
beginning, we discovered that marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: was indeed the most efficient,
most reliable and safest part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had had a lot of surgeries as a child,
so any surgery was detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I lost my right eye to the
conventional treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lost one eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was against the law for 12 years
worrying about when my children would be
[SPEAKER_00]: taken away from me, when I would be
arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working became impossible in the 80s
because they started with their P test and
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't qualify for most jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stayed home and became your tax
burden, something I really didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The public support once I was arrested,
however, I think was extremely helpful to
[SPEAKER_00]: me because even South Florida,
as backwards as it seems sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: was very, very supportive of medical
marijuana and understood my dilemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got an attorney from there who
represented me pro bono.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I would definitely have been in
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a doctor who understood that his
Hippocratic Ode was more important than
[SPEAKER_00]: the politics of medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he testified on my behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: A judge who was running for election at
the time, who also understood that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: neither created my illness nor the fact
that God's work was most efficient for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So marijuana became my medicine legally as
I was acquitted of charges of possession
[SPEAKER_00]: and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since then, because we had that
acquittal, we were able to talk the
[SPEAKER_00]: government into parting with their
precious hemp, which they give to us as
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine to substitute the marijuana the
doctor prescribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is working, thank God, and I am
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took 12 years, one eye, and a lot of
you out there to help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it took to become the first
woman to get legal marijuana from the
[SPEAKER_00]: program that is today providing it to
eight people in the entire country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing that they didn't realize
is that when they came after L.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Musica, they gave our movement a secret
weapon and she has been out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: place after place, speaking and waking
people up to what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
