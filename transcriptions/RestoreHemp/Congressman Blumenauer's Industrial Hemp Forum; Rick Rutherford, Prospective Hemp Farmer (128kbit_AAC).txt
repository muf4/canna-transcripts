[SPEAKER_00]: The more information we get out about hemp
and what a fabulous plant it is and what
[SPEAKER_00]: it can do for the economy of Oregon one
and for the economy of the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: is just tantamount.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not necessarily an expert by any
means, but I have educated myself on hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: because as a wheat farmer, what we
traditionally do is we grow one field one
[SPEAKER_00]: year with wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's harvested, you leave the stubble
on the ground and then that field stays
[SPEAKER_00]: fallow for an entire year so that the
plant breaks down and it puts nutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil and you also get some moisture
from the rain and so forth that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: stored in the ground and that's what the
wheat seeds use to grow up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out that hemp is a fabulous
rotational cash crop that you can be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in this field one year and you
have wheat in the other and then you swap
[SPEAKER_00]: them back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works very well as a natural herbicide
because it grows a lot faster than the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds do and it crowds them out
essentially so you wouldn't have to use
[SPEAKER_00]: quite as much herbicides as you would with
the traditional wheat that we do right now
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would rather not have to do it,
but there's a lot of weeds and stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: are very aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's thistle and like, morning glory
and things that will take over a field
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly and you lose your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our first hemp harvest in the
United States in over 50 years in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome and I hope to be able to
do that myself very soon and I have to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: the question, well why can't I myself grow
hemp and that question is that some years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago some very moneyed interests,
the Hearst family, the DuPonts,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Rockefellers got together and they
came up with a thing called the Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time people referred to hemp as
hemp and so when this legislation was
[SPEAKER_00]: going through they had changed the name to
marijuana so that the hemp farmers were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well I don't know what this
marijuana thing is and so they didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in it until the last minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it was a little bit too late and they
were pushed out to the point where they
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't do it anymore until they started
the Hemp for Victory process during World
[SPEAKER_00]: War II because we needed to have ropes and
canvas and a lot of things to use in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ships and to fight against the Axis power
and one of the reasons why that is is
[SPEAKER_00]: because hemp is one of the strongest plant
fibers known to man and it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to seawater so seafaring peoples
of the world have been using it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: ropes and their canvas and their sails for
years and years and years because it lasts
[SPEAKER_00]: a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact they found ships at
the bottom of the Mediterranean Ocean that
[SPEAKER_00]: had been down there for 2,000 years or
more and they have hemp fibers on there
[SPEAKER_00]: and when they bring them up they still can
identify them as hemp fibers because of
[SPEAKER_00]: its faddous resistant to seawater and so I
think that it would be an amazing thing
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to be able to actually farm it
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to those moneyed interests they
also came up with something called the
[SPEAKER_00]: Reefer Madness campaign in order to get
people on board with making hemp go away
[SPEAKER_00]: they had to make people think that if
people smoked it they were going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy and jump off buildings and rape
people and do all kinds of stuff and they
[SPEAKER_00]: did a really good campaign of smearing it
ran well first it was fabulous at doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that propaganda and he promulgated that
idea and that idea still stands today as a
[SPEAKER_00]: matter of fact one of congressman
Blumenauer's cohorts he works with is
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle Bachman and she has an ad on her
webpage that is called the faces of pot
[SPEAKER_00]: and what they did is they took the faces
of meth lady and said she was a beauty
[SPEAKER_00]: queen and then two weeks later look at her
after smoking pot and she just has this
[SPEAKER_00]: melted face and so it's just silly that a
lot of people still believe in that stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what hemp or marijuana would do to
somebody that they smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact my father used to make
jokes about smoking rope and his buddies
[SPEAKER_00]: would laugh and I would be like that's
smoking rope I don't understand this and I
[SPEAKER_00]: later found out it's because ropes are
made from hemp and hemp was associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with the things that are intoxicated in
which it is not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing I know about hemp is
that it is one of the most easily
[SPEAKER_00]: digestible plant proteins known to man and
there are no known allergens to it so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can eat it you can put it on your body you
can do all kinds of things with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really fabulous and I think that
again we should be able to farm it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States I want to be able to farm it
as soon as possible we're of course going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to do studies because we don't
know what strains are going to grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: areas like Eastern Oregon Dufour doesn't
get a lot of rain so the moisture that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of the sky in the springtime and
the wintertime that's essentially what you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to irrigate your crops with we're also
in an area where you don't do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation from the ground unless you're
growing something like alfalfa but you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't grow alfalfa in some of the higher
areas it's usually in the lower stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have some of the best alfalfa in the
world but you know I'm partial to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again it comes down to educating
yourselves and that's one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did was educate myself on it as
much as I could with the limited things
[SPEAKER_00]: the limited information more information
is coming online nowadays which is
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous but recently a gentleman did a
really simple film called bringing it home
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a great little documentary it's
really short it's funny and it's got some
[SPEAKER_00]: great information about the differences
between the cannabis and deca cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: tea with why their cousins and why we
should be able to tell the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two so if you guys could get a
chance to look at that I don't know where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's on Netflix or whatever but you should
be able to find it someplace but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: called bringing it bringing it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I urge everybody to watch that so yeah
that's all I've got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I do want to say one thing if
Monsanto gets a protection act why don't
[SPEAKER_00]: we have an Oregon farmer protect us from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect us from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
