[SPEAKER_00]: I need all of us to gather our voices and
let Congress know as soon as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: put your joint down, step away from your
bond just for a little while, and let them
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you need them to end cannabis
prohibition today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 800,000 of us are being arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that bullshit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm calling bullshit and I need you
to call bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you to make the connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean to score.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean let's score with Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make them start thinking about us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a huge constituency out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to your town hall meetings in the town
you live in and let your representatives
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you don't want to take it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That prohibition is not patriotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not patriotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition is a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just like I said, a bunch of
bullshit, just like you agreed with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't you tired of our people being
arrested?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired, tired, tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year the numbers eke up a little bit
higher and a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me a year ago that I could not
open the world famous cannabis cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were world famous in 24 hours and it's
been a year and it's still going on strong
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give away medicine and you could have a
cannabis cafe in your city, but it's up to
[SPEAKER_00]: you to stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand with me stand with normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go over here to the normal booth and join
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Keith Straub who's the founder of
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is Papa normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started before any other organization
and that's why I stand strong with normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ladies, you need to buckle up your
bras and get on board with the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: women's alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pauline Sabin stood her ground and fought
against alcohol prohibition and we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women, come on, join the normal women's
alliance, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because your children are going to be
arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brothers and your sisters are going
to be arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must take a stand now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everybody hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hear what I'm saying to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you stand with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out there and sign these petitions so
we can change tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have a more sensible future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's spend our money feeding people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's spend our money housing the
homeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to fight against Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's legalize industrial hemp so no other
Americans have to die for foreign oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could grow our own oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could feed our people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can save this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're destroying it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote hemp, fight for the end of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, I'm the chief petitioner for
sensible Oregon and I'm telling you,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're an Oregonian, go find us,
sign our petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, come down to the cannabis cafe if
you live in Oregon and if you live
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere, come pay us a visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what reality, altering reality is
really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single day we give it away and it's
always 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you will drop the money in the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help support him fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Madeline Martinez from Oregon normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get up.
