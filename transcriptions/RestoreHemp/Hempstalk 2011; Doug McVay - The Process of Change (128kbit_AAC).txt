[SPEAKER_00]: Vivian, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My God, look at all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taken a long time, but we're finally
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with Voter Power, manage their
Portland Patient Resource Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also working with the Oregon Marijuana
Policy Initiative, one of the three
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization initiatives currently
circulating in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three chances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three opportunities to change the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting one of those on the ballot
will send a message across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pass one, and we've changed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all up to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started working in this state years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: My good friend Paul Stanford and John Sejo
and I and a lot of other people put
[SPEAKER_00]: something called the Oregon Marijuana
Initiative on the ballot back in 1986.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, back then, this was just a
dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one ever believed that we'd have
millions of people around the country safe
[SPEAKER_00]: because their medical cannabis patients in
legal states like the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never dreamed it could happen,
and it did because we've never stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never stopped believing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a registered voter, if you're a
registered voter and you have not yet
[SPEAKER_00]: signed the initiatives, do it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only sign once, but sign each of those
initiatives that one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a registered voter,
register.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not a registered voter
because you're too young, thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick up information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to these tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get their information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get their literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here to learn, my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if this were an anti-nuclear
demonstration, if this were about health
[SPEAKER_00]: care, the environment, the economy,
anything else, we'd have newspapers filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with pictures of you and how proud they
are that you're taking an interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: politics, taking an interest in making
social change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, we're going to get shots of
kids smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yo, the joint is not the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to fight for our rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the right to party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means we need you to be educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need you to educate your parents and
your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never too young to start being
serious about making this a better world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a movement powered by love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and it's also powered by money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see people around gathering
donations.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great groups here, the Hampton
Cannabis Foundation, which is the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, all the others,
Oregon Normal and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought that glass piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got an extra five bucks left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donate it to a good cause, because that's
how this kind of stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how this kind of stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank all of you and all the
people who make this possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is how change happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug McVeigh from Voter Power's Patient
Resource Center and also the Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Policy Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Doug's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The joint's not the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for every joint that dies,
a roach is born.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
