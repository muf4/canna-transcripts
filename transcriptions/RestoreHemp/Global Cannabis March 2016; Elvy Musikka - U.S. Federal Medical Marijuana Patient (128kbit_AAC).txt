[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be here in a place where you
know the voters understand the needs of
[SPEAKER_00]: both the patients and the recreational
people and we all understand that for
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreationalists is the most benign
therapeutically active substance
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting your neuro endocannabinoid
systems It's just to deny us the access to
[SPEAKER_00]: this wonderful herb is really Sacrilegious
it is a war against the creator's work
[SPEAKER_00]: work it is a war against the people here I
am I have been legal authorized by the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal government for 27 years I had to
prove to FDA DA and NIDA that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: the most efficient the most reliable and
the safest part of my treatment as it
[SPEAKER_00]: turns out today it is the only part of my
treatment and I am at an age where most of
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends have a medicine cabinet full of
nasty drugs that cost them to take other
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs which they have it on their brain
their liver their heart and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else they're trying to protect that
marijuana does well gee it's a wonder the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical and the health industry
just don't want it to change they will
[SPEAKER_00]: lose 50% of their business at least the
day cannabis takes its rightful place in
[SPEAKER_00]: our society I applaud you for having made
so much progress but you know the jobs far
[SPEAKER_00]: from over I don't know why we're not
having million marches all over this
[SPEAKER_00]: country behind Barney Sanders he's the
only one that's come up with a plan that
[SPEAKER_00]: just might work to end the federal war on
us this needs to change we need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: behind this man is the only hope I have
seen lately changing laws as long as the
[SPEAKER_00]: feds say no my doctor still doesn't have
the right to practice his hypocritical in
[SPEAKER_00]: other words he's not allowed to have the
First Amendment of the Constitution and
[SPEAKER_00]: neither are you not really we can rant and
rave and all but we can't even light up
[SPEAKER_00]: after all those approvals I don't feel
free to light up right now I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hassle you know how cause you a problem
this is disgusting this is ridiculous and
[SPEAKER_00]: to charge someone that wants to start a
cannabis business $5,000 when someone can
[SPEAKER_00]: open a liquor store for 500 there is
something really messed up about this we
[SPEAKER_00]: have come a long ways but obviously we're
not done with this job we need to change

[SPEAKER_00]: only thing that's really going to change

[SPEAKER_00]: bureaucracies and that your own
legislators still make you suffer come on
[SPEAKER_00]: with this bureaucracy I lost sight that I
had maintained for 37 years when you got
[SPEAKER_00]: greedy I wanted more money than I could
pay you for my license to honor my
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription that's ridiculous like my
daughter said man-made booze got made pot

love always be your guiding light but
[SPEAKER_00]: don't sit on the job don't let another
