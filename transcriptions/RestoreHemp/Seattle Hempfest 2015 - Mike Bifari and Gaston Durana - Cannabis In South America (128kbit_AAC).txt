[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much Tom, always been
inspiring for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I wanted to first give a little short
two phrases of each country as far as we
[SPEAKER_01]: know that's going on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: First to mention like Argentina is the
last in the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can mention Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay and Chile, Argentina will be the
[SPEAKER_01]: last concerning the change of the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have the same law since 1989,
which is totally a provisionist law,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if we start from who is more
advanced, we have to say Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uruguay in December 2013 legalized
cannabis for over the counter,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sales and production.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had three legs of production and
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only two of them are currently available,
which is the self-cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: the homegrown and the creation of social
clubs between 15 and 45 persons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what is actually working now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part of the plan which was to
give through licensed growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: through the pharmacies, that has not been
implemented yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far Uruguay is a step ahead of the rest
of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And second we can say Chile because Chile
had big advances since improving
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves since one year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government authorized medical gardens
for 200 patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first pilot project and it
went through and now that's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: people are going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Ana Maria Gasmuri and Daya
Foundation in Chile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the Congress is discussing six
plants per residence and up to half kilo
[SPEAKER_01]: of dry buds in your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not legal yet, but they are
discussing these terms in the Congress
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brazil has a really repressive law,
but this last year there was a Supreme
[SPEAKER_01]: Court decision that allows parents that
have kids with epilepsy to import CBD oil
[SPEAKER_01]: from here from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was an advance too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got here to the states two weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since these two weeks we received the news
that in Argentina one of our medical
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that was suiting the city hall
for allowing him to grow his own plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: finally the Supreme Court gave the favor
to the patient and now the government has
[SPEAKER_01]: to allow him to plant or give him the
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically this is what's going on
objectively concerning the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have not changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean they changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uruguay changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chile is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that Argentina must change
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Argentina is the country that has more
home growers, cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big number of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We created a movement of these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last march we had 150,000 personas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about the global marijuana
march.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are advancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message here that we wanted to give to
all the people of the Seattle Hemfest is
[SPEAKER_01]: that the changes are made by people of we
say like the Spanish bone and blood,
[SPEAKER_01]: real people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real human beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people are not really conscious
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you guys are ahead with
all this and you got to put together all
[SPEAKER_01]: that conscious that you created all these
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I believe that when you don't have
the law change in one state, you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: change the law from that state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a group of people willing to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go through all the process,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the signatures, go to the ballot and
then win and then make the change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that creates conscious around what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the good part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're creating a lot of conscious in
this world change of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say thank you for inviting me
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We in Argentina, 30 years we came back to
democracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a representative democracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The elite that controls the world and
rules, also rules our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have imposed military dictations and
economic policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among those, the prohibition of the war on
drugs and the war.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are demonstrating at the beginning
for self-cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we have a representative
democracy, people have to gain them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important what you do here with
the ballots, with this representative
[SPEAKER_01]: democracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different than ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important what you do here,
the impact for the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time there is a state here that
legalizes or normalizes the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, puts in evidence the federal
government that's doing a different thing
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generate conscious and give information.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law prohibits everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't even get together and make an
organization concerning the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to change everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything comes from the people to the
representatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big change we're making,
conscious of the citizens for the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
