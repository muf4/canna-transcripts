[SPEAKER_00]: My medical issue started with comas,
surgeries, seizures, anxiety, and yes
[SPEAKER_00]: PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started on 36 meds a day and I've
managed with the help of cannabis and my
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors to only have one pill a day now in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all individuals with different
needs and so please I beg of you to please
[SPEAKER_00]: leave our medical alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have managed so far to be able to take
ourselves off of prescription drugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: get to some way of having a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I along with my husband Big Mike and
another couple Jesse and Mary opened the
[SPEAKER_00]: other spot a year and three months ago for
a place that not only OMMP card holders
[SPEAKER_00]: could partake in their medicine but also
get the information that they need such as
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys, current dispensaries,
information provided by medical clinics
[SPEAKER_00]: such as THCF which is now in power.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provided birthdays, anniversaries,
karaoke, boomers comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We unfortunately also provided that we
have in this community built on injury and
[SPEAKER_00]: sickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also provided celebration of
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say I miss you okay Ray,
John, Craig, Dr. Levesque.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the pictures are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those gentlemen gave a lot to this
community and people need to recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gatherings for fellow patients also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are much more than a place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a place that became family.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband, my son, and my daughter are
all also patients and since the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids were added to the Oregon
Clean Air Act we have had to close the
[SPEAKER_00]: other spot January 1st because we couldn't
afford the $500 a day fine nor did we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to break the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please I also beg of you please remove the
cannabinoids from the Clean Air Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fair to any of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also have patients breaking
another law that this fine state has
[SPEAKER_00]: established and that's smoking in public
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have places for these people
to go, they'll go to your parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please support things coming up
such as Hempstock, our festival that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have here in September 24th and 25th down
at Waterfront in Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please support these social clubs like PGN
in Kaiser, Northwest Cannabis Club,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't think that one day the other
spot will not rise again out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: community ashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and please vote and continue to
have your voice heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always showing good stonerism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
