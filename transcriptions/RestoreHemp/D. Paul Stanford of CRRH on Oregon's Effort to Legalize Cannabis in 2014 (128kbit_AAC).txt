[SPEAKER_01]: What have we learned from Colorado and
Washington, and what have these two states
[SPEAKER_01]: done especially well or poorly from what
you've seen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I think that in Washington,
the bill is fairly poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't allow people to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It limits the possession to an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have over 28 grams in Washington,
you have a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have over 40 grams, you'll go to
jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is dramatically better than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Colorado, they have a particularly
onerous system of regulation that requires
[SPEAKER_01]: video cameras on the grow site from seed
to sale with video feed to the state
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely over-regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen prices of $700 and $800 an
ounce in Washington and several hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars an ounce in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not going to wipe out the black
market at those prices, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think initiative 53 will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a $35 an ounce tax is certainly
reasonable, and I think it's a lot better.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
