[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, my name is Jennifer
Valley, and I'm here to encourage all of
[SPEAKER_00]: you to become involved in the healthcare
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reality is, medical marijuana is the most
significant and important healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: program Oregon offers, and it's being
completely ignored by the healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Health Authority is the program
that runs Oregon Medical Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Program, and they have meetings every
week, sometimes three or four times a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are five of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one person can get to them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are downtown Portland,
some of them are in Salem, some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are in Wilsonville.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, we all need to be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be there telling our stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make it clear to them that the
war on drugs is not doing as much good for
[SPEAKER_00]: us as it is bad for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my cancer ignored by my doctor for
four years because she was too busy
[SPEAKER_00]: worrying about the fact that I smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: To practice medicine in my exam room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I'm not the only person with this
kind of story, and we all need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: telling the Oregon Health Authority our
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be part of it, and they're the
ones who run the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones who need to be educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you all to look up Oregon
Health Authority's calendar and go down
[SPEAKER_00]: and hit a couple of their meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit a bunch of their meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you can do to make your voice
heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time because right now they're
getting ready for the next session.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want bills for us instead of
only bills against us, we need to be there
[SPEAKER_00]: setting the platform and telling them what
we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now's our opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
