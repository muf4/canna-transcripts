[SPEAKER_00]: We can stop the madness of marijuana
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people out there that are in
jail today, like Mark Henry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw his wife here a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was sentenced yesterday to five years
simply for selling a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to Malaysia, there are
people in Malaysia that are sentenced to
[SPEAKER_00]: death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just this week they sentenced a guy to
death for just about three pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people already scheduled to
hang in Malaysia for 300 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm carrying around about that
much right now, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we've got to stop this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are being incarcerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ruining their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're losing our children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even medical marijuana patients have to go
through hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in Washington State,
the medical marijuana law just right over
[SPEAKER_00]: there across that river is just an
affirmative defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the medical marijuana law is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helped a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sick people have an option now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we really want to do is just
completely legalize marijuana and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're working for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in California, there is a
historic vote, Proposition 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 1974, there was a vote in
California that was also called
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coincidentally, it was also a
marijuana vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first marijuana vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got about 40% of the vote back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year's Proposition 19 looks like
it's going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get our voters out, we will win
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an initiative here in Oregon
that will help medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ballot measure 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the chief petitioners was just up
here, Anthony Johnson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we strongly support ballot measure 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: We urge you to get out there and help us
get it passed and mobilize and register
[SPEAKER_00]: and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's really one of the keys
here, as we know, in this system is to
[SPEAKER_00]: register and vote and get our voters out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the polls show that ballot
measure 74 here in Oregon can pass by a
[SPEAKER_00]: good majority.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to the list of the people
who are likely voters, people who say,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I'm definitely going to vote,
it's a lot, lot closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only ahead by a couple of points,
where the polls show we're ahead by about
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 points overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But among likely voters, it's much,
much closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means our unlikely voters need to get
off their duff and get out there and vote
[SPEAKER_00]: and get their friends to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the only way we're going to
make a difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we need to work for global
cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this event is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to end adult marijuana prohibition
and restore industrial hemp for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: many things that industrial hemp does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key among those is energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that when marijuana is legal,
we'll be driving most of our cards on
[SPEAKER_00]: hip-seed oil, most of the time,
on the world's most productive biodiesel
[SPEAKER_00]: resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the byproduct from that is food.
[SPEAKER_00]: An acre of hemp, according to a study out
of University of Southern Illinois that
[SPEAKER_00]: was published in Notre Dame back in 74,
an acre of hemp, wild hemp, feral hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the United States, will produce
8,500 pounds of seeds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you press that, you get over 300
gallons of oil per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's six barrels of oil per acre just
from a cold pressing of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the residue out of that 8,500 pounds
of seeds is 6,000 pounds of high protein
[SPEAKER_00]: hip-seed meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we start driving our cars on hemp
fuel, the waste product will wipe out
[SPEAKER_00]: world hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a miracle plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that hemp and cannabis are the
greatest gift from our mother earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's our job to bring that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to take us all educating
our fellow Americans and getting out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I urge you, if you're not registered to
vote, go over to the THCF booth over here
[SPEAKER_00]: and register to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a petition over there that will
legalize marijuana here in Oregon in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gathering some sponsorship
signatures on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a registered voter here in
Oregon, go right over to the THCF booth,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is right over there, corner,
and sign that petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to, in closing,
urge you folks to work for global cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom, to help those people in Malaysia
who are sentenced to death and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to hang and their families are left
there to deal with that, to help the
[SPEAKER_00]: people like Clark Emory and Eddie Lep,
who've spoken on this stage, so they
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't incarcerated, aren't left in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to work for global cannabis
freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help our mother earth, the web of life,
all the plants and animals on this planet,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to restore balance to the energy
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we can help that is to work for
global cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of our brothers and sisters
who have fallen on the way, like Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Herr, who last year suffered a eventually
fatal heart attack right here at our hip
[SPEAKER_00]: stock festival, gave his last speech right
here on this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for Dr. Todd Micaria, who helped push
medical marijuana and spoke for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: two years on this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of our brothers and sisters who've
fallen along the way, I urge you to work
[SPEAKER_00]: for global cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help us restore hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the healing of the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Paul Stanford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Paul Stanford.
