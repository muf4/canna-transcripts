[SPEAKER_00]: much on this show something new every day
now this is a corn silk from Great Britain
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is made from cannabis indica there
must be a hundred different medicines out
[SPEAKER_00]: there for corns made from cannabis back
between 1840 and 1930 you'd think that it

that much now this one last of our
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine bottles and this is the newest
addition to the THCF collection here this
[SPEAKER_00]: is for cough it's a cough treatment syrup
it has this one it has let me just say
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis indica and morphine diacetate so
that's heroin so this was cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin and that's from 1890 yes the bottle
says that too just from the color of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle it predates world war one yeah it's
a pretty nifty bottle and to think that
[SPEAKER_00]: they sold cannabis mixed with heroin over
the counter for coughs and little bottles

knock you out too that's powerful mixture
