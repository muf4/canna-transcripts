[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to finally be able to see legal
cannabis and to buy some legally as an
[SPEAKER_07]: adult.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been growing my own, so I haven't
really gone to any of these dispensaries
[SPEAKER_07]: before.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first time I've ever bought
marijuana over a counter at a cash
[SPEAKER_07]: register.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's what we've been working for for
many, many years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just happy the day has finally
come.
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked for a Jack Herrer joint here
thinking I recognize that name.
[SPEAKER_07]: He would be so proud to be here today.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He petitioned hundreds, maybe thousands of
hours here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: His book was written right here in Oregon
for the first edition.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is an exciting day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I figured I'd probably be doing this
in about 1972, but it's taken a few years
[SPEAKER_06]: longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been going to Amsterdam for a very
long time and buying recreational and
[SPEAKER_06]: social marijuana over the counter and
sharing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got a long way to go before
we're at that level.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really great to see a good start
here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a real surreal moment,
you know, talking to you about the
[SPEAKER_01]: progress that we've made and really the
long hard fight over decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think about people like LK,
Jim Gregg, Jim Clark, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people that put in decades of this fight
who aren't with us, who weren't able to
[SPEAKER_01]: see a day like today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it means a lot for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in high school, I first won a
debate about marijuana legalization back
[SPEAKER_01]: in like 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: In college, I helped decriminalize
marijuana in Columbia, Missouri.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my goal was to help legalize the state
by 2020, you know, in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington legalized in 2012 and then
Oregon, Alaska and D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to have a day like today,
it's really a day for celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: A day for reflection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know in my heart that despite the
improvements we still need to make here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon, that we're going to remain
vigilant and we're going to have a law
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be the model for the rest of the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can stop this insane and barbaric
practice of arresting and jailing people
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis all across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today is a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each step of the way has been very
surreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have been waiting a long
time to see this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a historical moment that we're all
finally able to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is showing the freedom that we all
should have and the right that we all
[SPEAKER_00]: should have to recreate not only Medicaid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought that this day would never come
to reality, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're really happy and we're happy for
the people of Oregon, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that you went through the ballot and you
succeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the result.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too bad it's taken so long and the
commuting is going to kill me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down from Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a true pleasure to be able to act
like a normal person and get the product
[SPEAKER_02]: when you want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fighting for legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a worldwide process that sooner or
later will come to every single place and
[SPEAKER_03]: every single spot in the world because
it's a medicine and it's just insane that
[SPEAKER_03]: it has to be illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a key moment in history,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's food, so we have to take care of that
food for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that here in Oregon,
we're going to show, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cities and counties in Eastern Oregon
that have banned marijuana businesses,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can have regulated sales,
create jobs, generate revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sky's not going to fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to carry over to more
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more and more states are going to both
legalize adult use cannabis, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of those states that comes into the
legalized realm, that adds additional
[SPEAKER_01]: senators and representatives who represent
people who are living in states that have
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized marijuana of some sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Congresswoman Blumenauer
believes five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think within 10, for sure, we're going
to repeal federal prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be left up to the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that Oregon with home cultivation,
keeping medical, no per se, DUI,
[SPEAKER_01]: low taxes, relatively low barriers to
entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have the best policy in the
country, unless states look at what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: done and even improve upon what we've
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in many ways we're going to be
a model for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the United States, looking at a
global sphere, the United States has been
[SPEAKER_01]: the one pursuing the global drug war,
the global war on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once the United States ends
prohibition, I think we can expect most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the world to do the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the biggest thing is to educate
people, educate your politicians.
[SPEAKER_07]: Educate your family, educate your friends
that marijuana is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need hemp for our environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need cannabis for many different
physical issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the more alcohol we can replace with
cannabis, the better off we'll all be.
Thank you.
