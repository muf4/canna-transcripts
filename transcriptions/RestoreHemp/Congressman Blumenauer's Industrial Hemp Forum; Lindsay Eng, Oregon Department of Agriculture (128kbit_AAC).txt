[SPEAKER_00]: We are navigating the waters at the
Department of Agriculture and looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: developing rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're very interested in learning
from those that have experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp and how we can make the
rules here in the state common sense and
[SPEAKER_00]: work for farmers and handlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just give a little overview of the
history kind of where we are in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senator Perzanski's bill as Eric
mentioned, passed the Oregon legislature
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've talked about it and most
of you in the room are familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Agriculture did not move
forward at that time in promulgating rules
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the quasi-legal status.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some concern that given the
Controlled Substances Act and the need for
[SPEAKER_00]: a DEA permit and the illegality in most
cases for you to grow hemp, we didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be licensing farmers to be able to grow
it if it was putting them in jeopardy
[SPEAKER_00]: under federal law as well as us as the
state agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the Washington and Colorado
electorates passed their legislation last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, we put together an internal team to
start looking at if we had medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in Oregon, if we had marijuana
for personal use that would be legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: in Oregon, would that change what we could
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we saw the August 29th Department
of Justice memo that Congressman mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that had how states can move forward and
the eight kind of principles for a robust
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement system that the Department of
Justice would be expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've looked at that and we've been
looking at moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where we are now is we've kind of
developed a rules advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, in any rulemaking that we do,
we always want to make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be applicable and common sense
for the actual producers and handlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Oregon law focuses on licensing and
permitting of growers and handlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought a copy of it but I don't know,
most of you have probably seen it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can certainly provide copies if you guys
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the essential elements of the way the
Oregon statute reads is that it asks the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture to license on a
three year basis growers and handlers of
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that means is, obviously
growers I think is the self-explanatory
[SPEAKER_00]: piece, but handlers would be the first
handler, the person who would be receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: the raw agricultural product and
processing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the Congressman mentioned, processed
hemp products are legal for interstate
[SPEAKER_00]: commerce and there's not an issue there
but it's the seed going to a processor who
[SPEAKER_00]: can process it for oil that would have to
be licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also a permitting
process, also a three year permit that
[SPEAKER_00]: would allow seed dealers so that we could
have viable seed be able to be sold for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently under controlled substances act,
only sterilized seed so that you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow is allowed to be sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the Oregon law focuses on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also, the Congressman mentioned the
definition of industrial hemp which is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in our state statute at the .3%
of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there would have to be inspections
where we would take samples of the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: and test those for THC content to ensure
that it was below the .3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're dealing with and
we'll be promulgating rules around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rules will kind of focus on
application for licenses, what we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: get in order to issue those licenses and
permits, the inspection procedures,
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling procedures, how often,
at what time in the growing process would
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously fees, it would have to be a fee
supported program so we'll have to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the fiscal impact of the department as
well as the users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also things like tolerances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if .3% is the definition in our
statute, what is the tolerance as we test
[SPEAKER_00]: and how close can we test it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What part per million level are we going
down to and what we need to go down to?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those kinds of things are what we'll be
working on with our rules advisory
[SPEAKER_00]: committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have started to contact people for the
rules advisory committee that under Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: state administrative procedures law that
directs us on how we develop
[SPEAKER_00]: administrative rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rules advisory committees are generally
mostly for fiscal impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're supposed to be used
for but we will obviously be using our
[SPEAKER_00]: committee and leaning on them heavily to
help in the practical application and the
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomic application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've tried to get a couple of
growers, a couple of handlers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm bureau.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a representative from Oregon
Senator Prozanski's office and OSU,
[SPEAKER_00]: we best rest to be on the panel so that we
can have those experts weigh in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we meet with that committee
and we're hoping to do that in early
[SPEAKER_00]: December, then the rules process is such
that we would have an open comment period
[SPEAKER_00]: and a hearing, potentially multiple
hearings if we feel the need to but we put
[SPEAKER_00]: out the draft rules and then have an open
comment period where we would take
[SPEAKER_00]: comments, review those comments and see if
any changes need to be made before the
[SPEAKER_00]: rule went into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have said, I think there was an
Argonian article this week that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to, we would like to have the rule
in place by the spring planning season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very aggressive timeline and
we'll be working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're getting started in
early December.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should hopefully, we hope to have
rules out for comment by their definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: first quarter of next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's mostly what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably our most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As part of our rules advisory committee,
one of the things that we are looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if anyone in this room knows of someone
or is somebody who is a fiber handler,
[SPEAKER_00]: a first handler of fiber, we have a couple
of representatives on our committee that
[SPEAKER_00]: can do the oil squeezing and handling of
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have anyone at this point
that can process the fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd certainly like to hear that point of
view because there's a lot of fiber as we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that'll be produced.
