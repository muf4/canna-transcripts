[SPEAKER_00]: What I think is a necessary component,
all right, look at hemp as earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn everything you can possibly learn
about hemp the same way you've learned it
[SPEAKER_00]: about medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn it about hemp and communicate it to
the non-medical marijuana part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when they see the economic
environmental realities that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by this renewable energy source
of hemp, the dynamic will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a decision that you have to make
whether you're willing to put your energy
[SPEAKER_00]: in to connecting with hemp energy to
create a larger energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, and vote hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna vote, vote hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
