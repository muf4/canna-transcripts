[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, thank you so much for coming
on this first beautiful day in a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really memorable for me to be here
because the Seattle Peace Heroes really
[SPEAKER_00]: started right across the street when Tower
Records used to be directly across the
[SPEAKER_00]: street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1987, we started Hittin' the Av,
trying to do positive things in the name
[SPEAKER_00]: of the counterculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think around 89, we started doing a
free table across the street right between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two, right in that wall here between
the two windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a PC in this free table there
for three summers, giving away free food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made sandwiches right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Starbucks coffee for free,
which didn't make Norchans very happy
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were selling coffee in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had free condoms and AIDS
information and crisis guides and toilet
[SPEAKER_00]: paper for homeless people and toothbrushes
and clothing and all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we gave all this stuff away for free
for three summers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how we lasted three summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a huge presence on the Av.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in University district-based
organization volunteer group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really memorable for me to be
here 25 years later on the other side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the street doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to read some of the earlier
chapters, which I think are the more
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting chapters in the book,
Protestible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no C in protestible, just so you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start off with a prologue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll read a couple of the first
chapters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say that there's 180 photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the protestible, the vast majority were
taken by Tony Lilly, who's sitting right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll set this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 160 pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 20 chapters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every chapter is a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every chapter starts with a full-page
picture of the poster from that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with the prologue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In times of universal deceit, telling the
truth is a revolutionary act, George
[SPEAKER_00]: Orwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to make out his words.
[SPEAKER_00]: His speaking often sounded slurred,
as if he'd had too many martinis at the
[SPEAKER_00]: company party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ambled across the hardwood floor,
taking in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunlight streaked through the large
bay windows next to the hospital bed in
[SPEAKER_00]: his living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once an active man, Freddie had been
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1980s when he was driving cab.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while, he was able to work with this
illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there came a time when Freddie went to
pick up patients from the hospital who had
[SPEAKER_00]: an easier time getting in and out of his
cab than he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like the pipe for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I followed with a lighter at first,
but as I got it positioned just right,
[SPEAKER_00]: Freddie took a long, slow drag on the
small glass pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He leaned his head back, leaving out a
long sigh as he excelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relief, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives me relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sat in the silence for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had met Freddie and his wife Annie a few
years earlier, and I watched Freddie's
[SPEAKER_00]: health decline as his illness progressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first met them, Freddie was
wheelchair bound, but he was essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: independent as long as he stayed on the
ground floor of their modest, well-kept
[SPEAKER_00]: home in the Seattle suburb of Burien.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freddie's wife Annie was an attractive
woman, slim with dark black hair cropped
[SPEAKER_00]: in a page boy bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had full lips, a great smile,
and deep brown eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She struggled to care for her husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a large man, and he was now unable
to do anything for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was struck by her loyalty and
dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: She could have easily hooked up with some
other guy, but Annie diligently stayed and
[SPEAKER_00]: cared for her man.
[SPEAKER_00]: She never complained and was always upbeat
and positive in Freddie's presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: She would do anything it took to make his
last days as free from suffering as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that helped Freddie manage
the tremors and the pain from his
[SPEAKER_00]: condition was marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annie worked odd jobs with Freddie's
disability checks with her principal
[SPEAKER_00]: income.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not able to afford as much cannabis as
Freddie needed to quell his suffering,
[SPEAKER_00]: Annie eventually installed a modest grow
room in the basement of their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every three months or so, she would
laboriously harvest and trim Freddie's
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life was very difficult, but they got by
without incident for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freddie would get sick and they would have
a scare, but he always bounced back.
[SPEAKER_00]: After several years, Freddie grew much
worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd come over to visit him, but I could no
longer understand anything my old friend
[SPEAKER_00]: was saying to me, nor could Freddie hold
the pipe for himself anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was paralyzed and confined to his bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annie had placed a full screen TV above
for him to watch, and he would fumble to
[SPEAKER_00]: negotiate the remote, the last bit of
control he had over his life, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly wasting away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in there, his mind was sharp as a
tack, but his body was no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperating with him in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was heartbreaking to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a beautiful wife, a wonderful home,
and he was slowly being consumed by his
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day, Annie had to run to the store for
some groceries.
[SPEAKER_00]: She often had to dart out of the house for
15 minutes or so, knowing that Freddie
[SPEAKER_00]: would be fine in his bed, his television
blaring.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this day would be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortly after Annie left the house,
it was raided by the local narcotics task
[SPEAKER_00]: force.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Freddie lay helpless in his bed,
unable to speak, strangers walked back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth throughout his home.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could hear the officers downstairs in
his basement tearing out wiring and
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting the cords to his lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: One by one, he watched his officers came
up from the basement carrying the green
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine that Annie had tended so
religiously, purely out of love for her
[SPEAKER_00]: man, for her Romeo, who had been so
unkindly stricken before they had a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to fulfill their dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Annie came home, she was met by law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had removed the plans, the lights,
and the ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she eventually made it downstairs
after the invaders had left, she was
[SPEAKER_00]: shocked to discover they had cut a hose
leading into her basement without turning
[SPEAKER_00]: off the water, and the basement had
completely flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freddie was removed from the home before
Annie had returned.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd just run to the store, but because
there was nobody at home at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the authorities decided that Freddie was
in danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freddie died about two weeks later,
his frail body unable to endure the stress
[SPEAKER_00]: of their home invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This all happened before there was a
medical marijuana law passed in Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was absolutely blown away that someone
in Freddie's condition could be treated as
[SPEAKER_00]: inhumanely when all he was doing was
trying to lessen his suffering with the
[SPEAKER_00]: wondrous powers of marijuana used,
as it had been, for millennia as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freddie and Annie's story is one of too
many from within the HempFest community to
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrate the suffering caused by
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, despite the will of the voters of
Washington State, qualified medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana patients are still being
mistreated because of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This book chronicles the Seattle HempFest
and the efforts we've made over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: to see that all Americans have the freedom
to benefit from quality hemp products and
[SPEAKER_00]: to choose to use cannabis if they so
desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to back up to the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had told anybody during the spring
of 1991 that we were going to place a
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana rally in one of Seattle's most
beautiful waterfront parks, fill it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: few hundred thousand pot enthusiasts,
staff it with volunteers, and that bands
[SPEAKER_00]: and speakers would come from all over the
nation to participate while the police
[SPEAKER_00]: looked on, well, they would have thought
we were crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a ragtag assembly of community
volunteers has accomplished over 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: of steady organizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result of hundreds upon hundreds of
planning meetings and rooted firmly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit of volunteerism, the Seattle
HempFest has endured two decades to be
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized as one of the flagship events
of the global cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This book is an overview from my
perspective of some of the high points of
[SPEAKER_00]: that 20-year endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: HempFest has been made possible because of
a huge community of individuals who have
[SPEAKER_00]: at one time or another expended energy and
made sacrifices necessary for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been thousands of people who
have made substantial contributions to the
[SPEAKER_00]: event, the organization, and the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: These folks have been the wind in
HempFest's sails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take this opportunity to honor
and to thank each and every HempFest
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteer who has participated in any of
the Seattle HempFest of the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of a more grassroots event,
and the sheer number of volunteer hours it
[SPEAKER_00]: has taken to bring the HempFest message of
freedom and personal responsibility to the
[SPEAKER_00]: world is just staggering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people in the HempFest organization
have sacrificed personal time with friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and family, absorbed out-of-pocket
expenses, and have contributed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cause above and beyond the call of duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's uncertain how much longer
HempFest can remain an all-volunteer
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, volunteerism has made this
political and cultural phenomenon
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is purely in the spirit of community
service that this great endeavor has
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred, and I hope that HempFest can
serve as an inspiration for others to
[SPEAKER_00]: participate in community volunteerism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel there's no greater act than that
which is intended to improve the lives of
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every task completed and every HempFest
produced has been in total solidarity with
[SPEAKER_00]: the thousands of activists in the global
cannabis liberation movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our beautiful culture has been in part
created by prohibition, which serves to
[SPEAKER_00]: support the notion that something good
comes out of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: My reward for my work for legalization has
been in meeting, knowing, and working with
[SPEAKER_00]: the incredible souls and spirits who I've
been privileged to come in contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: over these past years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider this work a living document,
and I invite anyone who has a correction,
[SPEAKER_00]: a recollection, or an event that they
think should be mentioned in future
[SPEAKER_00]: editions of HempFest to contact me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, just like HempFest,
this historical document will grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve with all of our collective
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter zero, the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activism springs from an intentional
action to bring about social, political,
[SPEAKER_00]: economic, or environmental change.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago, when a small group of
activists attended a community peace
[SPEAKER_00]: concert and decided to throw a humble
salvo at the United States war machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: something happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that initial political statement,
a protest phenomenon would spring forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: a clarion call for freedom and equality
that would eventually be heard around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Iraq military had just invaded the
nation of Kuwait.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Soviet Union was disintegrating,
and a local band named Nirvana was being
[SPEAKER_00]: assigned to Geffen, a major record label.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a community activist living in
Seattle, having founded an all-volunteer
[SPEAKER_00]: street-level community action group,
the Seattle Peace Events, a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been participating in an annual
summer series of musical performances that
[SPEAKER_00]: to this day alternates between various
parks in the city called the Seattle Peace
[SPEAKER_00]: Concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Peace Concerts series was initiated in
the 1980s by the Love Israel family,
[SPEAKER_00]: a spiritual group led by a charismatic
fellow named Love Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Called simply the Love Family,
by the early 90s, the group had relocated
[SPEAKER_00]: to an Arlington, Washington property where
they lived semi-community for several
[SPEAKER_00]: decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the late 1980s, a free outdoor urban
concert series had been picked up by
[SPEAKER_00]: former Love Family member Don Glenn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Seattle Peace Concerts is a
community-based project that affords
[SPEAKER_00]: unsigned bands an opportunity to perform
to an audience that, during the 90s,
[SPEAKER_00]: ranged from hundreds to several thousand
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concert series was well-intended in
those days, and many great Seattle acts
[SPEAKER_00]: routinely performed for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alison Shane's 1990 album, Facelift,
had just been released days before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That album would catapult the
Seattle-based band into mega stardom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Peace Concerts featured bands that
played on the tavern circuit where bands
[SPEAKER_00]: like Alison Shane's had gotten their
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The August 26 concert was the last of the
annual series, and it took place on a
[SPEAKER_00]: clear, sunny Seattle day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concert featured the Kathy Hart Band
with Tom McFarland, the Wombats,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Jerry Miller, legendary Grape,
formerly of Moby Grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summer was ending, and almost everybody
knew that America was poised to go to war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier that August, the Iraqi Army had
launched an invasion of Kuwait with four
[SPEAKER_00]: elite Iraqi Republican Guard divisions
rushing into the oil-rich Arab nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the right political environment for
a Peace Concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event was at Gasworks Park,
a 19-acre public park that was formerly a
[SPEAKER_00]: coal gasification plant operated by the
Seattle Light Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gasworks Park sits nestled on the
waterfront of Lake Union on the south end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Wallingford District.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once heavily polluted, the park was
eventually topped off by a clay cap
[SPEAKER_00]: several feet thick that was covered
densely with sod.
[SPEAKER_00]: The large metal holding towers still
stand, their rusty catwalks twisting and
[SPEAKER_00]: turning around the hulking, fenced-off,
cylindrical structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the August concert, some community
activists from the Seattle Portable
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor Theater, a Rainbow Family
guerrilla theater group, had erected a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge rainbow-striped canvas tent in the
middle of the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a handmade Bedouin-style canopy
that serves as a performance stage at the
[SPEAKER_00]: annual National Rainbow Gatherings.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the late-day sunshine streaked low
across the horizon, Peace Concert
[SPEAKER_00]: organizer Don Glenn remarked about the
irony of holding a concert for peace while
[SPEAKER_00]: America was about to embark upon war.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the President of the United States is
undermining peace in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty hard to hold a celebration for
peace, Glenn said to the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should stay right here until we can
hold a real Peace Concert, he continued.
[SPEAKER_00]: His words prompted a large handful of
participants to spend the night in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bright canvas tent to protest American
aggression in the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group decided it was going to hold a
political occupation at Gasworks Park
[SPEAKER_00]: until America had no military presence in
Iraq or Kuwait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was among those staying behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the first night in that tent,
it became apparent that we would need to
[SPEAKER_00]: find another location for sleeping,
as the Parks Department security people
[SPEAKER_00]: had arrived with a huge tow truck
promising to tear down our sacred
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, which contained our
possessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to move inside the large
covered Gasworks structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That worked well for a while until city
authorities threatened to side everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: for trespassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when a house was rented across the
street, where vigil goers could bathe and
[SPEAKER_00]: legally sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called the Vigil House and acted as
a flophouse for the various activists,
[SPEAKER_00]: drifters, and the generally socially
disenchanted people who made up the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the peace vigil's ranks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calling ourselves Peace Work Park,
Peace Vigil, this ad hoc political action
[SPEAKER_00]: went on to last six months and eventually
included hundreds of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notable cultural icons including Timothy
Leary and Allen Ginsberg attended the
[SPEAKER_00]: vigil at Gasworks, as well as the future
Washington governor, Mike Lowry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Peace Vigil became the site for
rallies, teach-ins, and other community
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many as 5,000 people attended the
largest peace rally there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large candle wax altar on a piece of
plywood constantly burned, tucked into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gasworks structure, and a low area
protected from the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was running water, sinks,
and fire pits.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a solid six months, keepers of the
vigil were present at that altar,
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were undoubtedly a few times in the
middle of the night that folks may have
[SPEAKER_00]: drifted off to sleep, but it was a
vigilant sleep, I assure you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest problem that we had at that
action were people being intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Witnessing the problems that we had at the
vigil with alcohol had a big impact on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided at that time that events that I
organized were going to be alcohol free.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this time, someone scheduled a
start-up meeting for a statewide chapter
[SPEAKER_00]: of the National Organization for the Form
of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at that outdoor meeting that
Hempfest was conceived.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at that meeting, as was a fellow I
did not know yet named Gary Cooke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary had been dissatisfied with the
momentum of the information gathering,
[SPEAKER_00]: the informal gathering of potential pod
activists, and he decided that he wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce an event that would promote
cannabis awareness and involve more
[SPEAKER_00]: members of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to educate the attendees on the
truth about the cannabis plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary had experience as a producer of punk
rock shows in Eugene, Oregon during the
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, everyone Gary talked to about
his ideas suggested that he contact me,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I was very high profile at that time,
involved in benefit shows, rallies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and demonstrations as an emcee and
organizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been operating the Seattle Peace
Heavans for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had founded the Seattle Peace Heavans in
1988 with a vision to engage other
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative culture youths and alternative
culture folks in community service,
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteerism, and general positive
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Targeting street level youth and homeless
people, the Peace Heavans had many
[SPEAKER_00]: projects aimed at benefiting the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longest lasting project is the Seattle
Crisis Guide, which can still be found at
[SPEAKER_00]: seattlecrisis.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this time, I was working as a
waiter at the last exit on Brooklyn,
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle's oldest coffee house,
and the central meeting place for a vast
[SPEAKER_00]: community of Seattle's diversity called
simply The Exit or The Zit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brick building was one large square
room located just blocks away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Washington campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exit was opened in 1967 by the
lovingly cantankerous Sir Siskie,
[SPEAKER_00]: who operated the trendy hangout until his
death in the early 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wallpaper, hanging on those walls
since the exit opened, had since been
[SPEAKER_00]: stained a rusty brown by thick layers of
cigarette smoke from over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poets, peaceniks, and panhandlers all vied
for a spot at one of the tables as the
[SPEAKER_00]: place was always packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were square marble slab tables along
the walls of the room that were said to
[SPEAKER_00]: have been stalled dividers from the
restrooms of the old King County
[SPEAKER_00]: courthouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the center of the room were large,
round, wooden tables reported to have been
[SPEAKER_00]: former card tables once used in a casino.
[SPEAKER_00]: People played Goh and chess on the tables,
backgammon was banned, and wandered up and
[SPEAKER_00]: out on the outside deck when the weather
was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last exit was a hub for bohemians in
Seattle, and every Monday night was an
[SPEAKER_00]: open music night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place would be filled to capacity,
standing room only, and there would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone stand set up in the middle of
the place, large PA speakers hanging from
[SPEAKER_00]: the ceiling, and incredible performances
took place there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As musicians would come from all over to
sign up for a slot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last exit served as my office because
my waiter job there allowed me to network
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the other activist types who came
through its busy doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have my organizer friends sit in
my section, and then I could go from table
[SPEAKER_00]: to table and network while I was taking
orders for coffee and brand muffins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle had a thriving live music scene as
the advent of grunge music had resulted in
[SPEAKER_00]: an explosion of live clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the singer in a rock band called
Stickerbush which had played many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same clubs where these alternative bands
became established.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always walking the streets of
Seattle, postering light poles and
[SPEAKER_00]: telephone poles with flyers promoting
Peace Heathens events and Stickerbush
[SPEAKER_00]: shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary tracked me down and shared his vision
of a public event that promoted cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: reform and education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary had just gotten a hold of a copy of
Jack Harrah's groundbreaking book,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very excited to discover how much
we didn't know about the history of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant and its rich resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggested Volunteer Park to Gary as a
good location for our first event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Peace Heathens had a handful of bulky
hand-held, hand-held CB radios at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and they offered the group services
for security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary contracted a friend, Seattle
musician, Neil Storm, who was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: scrape together a patchwork PA system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary created the promotional poster for
the first Hempfest using rub-on letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crude but effective poster advertised
the Washington Hemp Expo Alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: Resource and Energy Fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Members of the Peace Heathens got busy
putting up posters on Seattle's heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: laden telephone and light poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those grunge days, some telephone poles
in the city were seven to eight inches
[SPEAKER_00]: thick with paper posters promoting rock
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Peace Heathens knew how to hang
posters, and with the help of other
[SPEAKER_00]: organizers, we managed to plaster the city
with posters announcing the controversial
[SPEAKER_00]: new event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest is, as we like to say,
Hempstery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picture that first rub-on letter poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1991, The Roots, chapter one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle's Volunteer Park sits nestled
above the Capitol Hill neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_00]: an affluent, albeit culturally avant-garde
community that's perched overlooking the
[SPEAKER_00]: Interstate 5 corridor that runs through
the heart of downtown Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acquired in 1876 by the city of Seattle
for a mere $2,000, it was originally
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to be a cemetery, but it was
instead named Lakeview Park, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cemetery was created on an adjacent area
of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community land was dedicated to
volunteers who had served in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanish-American War.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sprawling park includes an impressive
glass conservatory, a Victorian greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: modeled after London's Crystal Palace,
a water tower replete with an observation
[SPEAKER_00]: deck, an enclosed reservoir, an art deco
building that's now the Seattle Asian Art
[SPEAKER_00]: Museum, a statue of William H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seward, and a sculpture called Black Sun
by Osamu Nobuo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sculpture became the inspiration for
the famous sound garden song, Black Hole
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun, released in 1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: Near the statue was a cement amphitheater,
crowned by cedar, pine, sequoia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and madrone trees that ring the outer edge
of the park's natural grassy bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Promoted as Washington Hemp Expo 91,
the first Hemp Fest took place on August
[SPEAKER_00]: 17, 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drove our vehicles up into the wooded
area behind the amphitheater, which has a
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid wall built around the backside of
it to project sound toward the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we arrived in the morning,
we were concerned that there were more
[SPEAKER_00]: homeless people sleeping in the park than
usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sound gear came in as the morning
progressed, and one by one, the homeless
[SPEAKER_00]: people woke up to the early sun and
approached the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we realized that these people
were not homeless at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had traveled from other places to
attend the rally.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few fellows informed us that they had
driven from other states just to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We began to realize that we were embarking
upon a path of activity that had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: popular support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a few hours, there were hundreds of
people milling about on blankets and lawn
[SPEAKER_00]: chairs or just sitting on the fresh new
mowed grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took my place at the microphone and
prepared to emcee the kickoff Hemp Fest
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The keynote speaker for the first Seattle
Hemp Fest was Jack Herr, the author of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp Activist Bible, The Emperor Wears No
Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary had contacted Jack, whose collection
of heavily researched fact toys,
[SPEAKER_00]: news clippings, and editorial rants,
first published in 1985, had already
[SPEAKER_00]: started a political grass fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herr had begun collecting information
about the campus plant and its uses as far
[SPEAKER_00]: back as 1976.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1973, spurred on by the life and
struggles of his friend, Captain Ed Adair,
[SPEAKER_00]: about whom he writes in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subtitled, The Historical Record of
Cannabis and of the Conspiracy Against
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana and How Hemp Can Save the World,
The Emperor Wears No Clothes reveals the
[SPEAKER_00]: rich global history that the cannabis hemp
plant has enjoyed throughout the advent of
[SPEAKER_00]: modern man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herr gave a speech that was explosive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp will save the planet, he insisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 5,000 years of human consumption,
not a single person has ever died from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crowd roared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unusual to see anyone speaking
publicly about ganja, but this guy was
[SPEAKER_00]: saying things nobody had ever heard
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the event was over, I made sure that
the peace heathens ethic of leave no trace
[SPEAKER_00]: was enforced, as I knew how critical it
was for us to leave the park as cleaner,
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner than we found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans had endured decades of
disinformation about pot smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which had long fomented a reputation for
stoners of being lazy and irresponsible
[SPEAKER_00]: deadbeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew we had to do everything we could to
counter those preconceived notions above
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: About us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thus began a Seattle hemp fest tradition
of picking up every stitch of litter in
[SPEAKER_00]: the parks that's been generated by the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We estimate that in 20 years of hemp fest,
we've picked up over a million cigarette
[SPEAKER_00]: butts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the cleanup was done and we had a
chance to reflect, we were incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: bolstered by the success of that first
hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were so eager, so hungry for a way
to express their passion for legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: and many folks told us that Seattle hemp
fest was exactly what they had been
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time for maybe just a couple more here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1992, The Sprout, chapter two.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little over a month before the 1992 hemp
fest, Bill Clinton was elected president
[SPEAKER_00]: of the United States after saying that he
never inhaled when he had smoked pot in
[SPEAKER_00]: college.
[SPEAKER_00]: As silly as his statement was,
my colleagues and I were pleased that the
[SPEAKER_00]: new president was a former pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier that year, Nirvana's Nevermind
album went to number one on the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billboard 200 chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the local music scene exploded with
young musicians flocking to Seattle in
[SPEAKER_00]: droves and performance clubs cropping up
all over the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those folks had never worn a
flannel shirt before, and Cobain's attire
[SPEAKER_00]: had young fans scouring thrift shops for
old sweaters to compliment their new
[SPEAKER_00]: shaggy hairstyles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was much younger and even more radical
than I am today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those days, I swore on stage and I was
largely disconnected on how my words could
[SPEAKER_00]: impact others or the general pop movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would change over time as my
awareness and sensitivity to these issues
[SPEAKER_00]: grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recall one of my slogans, the new world
order is an old world order, was one
[SPEAKER_00]: actually coined by the amazing songwriter
Jim Page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim has actually since told me that he
didn't, that he got that from me,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think I might have made it up myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was mistaken on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp fest was a very underground,
under the radar event and I was oblivious
[SPEAKER_00]: to any long term ramifications of the
words I said up on that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no idea that hemp fest would be
anything more than a flash in the pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had little concern with mixing political
issues and I had yet to really understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential our words had up there for
moving minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had not yet advanced to a point where I
was sensitive to the power and impact that
[SPEAKER_00]: our fledgling protest event would come to
wield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were operating mostly on intuition,
from a sincere desire to raise awareness
[SPEAKER_00]: about the incredibly resourceful cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, I developed a much deeper
sensitivity to the subtleties involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: public advocacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff would come from trial and
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the day finally came around for the
second Seattle Hemp Fest, the weather was
[SPEAKER_00]: terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun shone down and there was almost no
wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our crew had already thrown down a hemp
fest event and the set up and preparations
[SPEAKER_00]: went more smoothly this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to being the master of
ceremonies, they also got to perform at
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticker Bush, the band I was in at the
time, played at the second hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headlining the event was Bam Bam,
a local rock fusion band headed up by
[SPEAKER_00]: guitarist Tommy Martin, who still provides
sound for the hemp fest symposium stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge tent where speakers, panels,
keynote presentations and music takes
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on the bill was the renowned Seattle
reggae act, Gonja Farmers, an extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy stoner band, aptly named Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the rally started, I noticed
the crowd going crazy at something that
[SPEAKER_00]: appeared to be happening behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned around to see my two colleagues
bringing up two large budding sinsemia
[SPEAKER_00]: plants onto the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, I joked to Gary, no wonder you
wanted me to MC the event, you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mostly long-haired male rockers
comprised much of the crowd of roughly 800
[SPEAKER_00]: people were absolutely delighted to see
those shining examples of nature's finest
[SPEAKER_00]: work on display for all to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the event, nobody from hemp
fest had the courage to load those two pot
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into their car and drive away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say what we did with them,
but I can say that it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that we broke them up in little
pieces and threw them out to the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just not willing to put that on
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were aware of no police presence,
but we were certainly aware that the
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct sweet odor of burning marijuana
was there all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had successfully pulled off another
legalization rally, and this time we
[SPEAKER_00]: estimated that we had a total crowd of
over 2,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elated, we had pushed the envelope even
further, and we were apparently still free
[SPEAKER_00]: men.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1993, Chapter 3, The Awakening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our once-sleepy Pacific Northwest city had
apparently developed insomnia,
[SPEAKER_00]: as Sleepless in Seattle was the big motion
picture of 1993, and it seemed that our
[SPEAKER_00]: town had been discovered by a media hungry
to promote a new pop music mecca.
[SPEAKER_00]: An evolving punk metal hybrid genre of
music had been previously coined grunge by
[SPEAKER_00]: Green River and Mudhoney musician Mark
Arm, and Nirvana and Pearl Jam's first
[SPEAKER_00]: albums had catapulted the genre into a
mainstream music phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gone were the bigger the hair,
the closer to God hairstyles, and a much
[SPEAKER_00]: more natural, casual look took hold within
the youth music culture as the Seattle
[SPEAKER_00]: style of denim, flannel, and leather was
emulated by throngs of music bands all
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This trend was evident at the 1993 hemp
fest, as the audience was primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: comprised of young, long-haired,
motorcycle-jacketed males, and the event
[SPEAKER_00]: was even more over-the-top than the
previous fests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salamander, dandelion soup, and the ganja
farmers rocked the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eager to outdo the wild antics of previous
years, my comrades emerged from the
[SPEAKER_00]: backstage area with more budding senesemia
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, they also placed eight small
plastic bongs on the front of the stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: accompanied by eights of green bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first and last Seattle hemp fest
bong-a-thon took place before the cheering
[SPEAKER_00]: approval of the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: After inviting eight brave volunteers from
the crowd, we set out to see who could
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke their eighth of pot the fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recall that the fellow who won was
moderately excited to find out that he had
[SPEAKER_00]: just won the eighth of pot he had already
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary says there was an additional prize,
but that's not how I recall the event,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I barely recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was definitely a date of a slightly
remembered.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular hemp fest was in great
part produced by our brother, Christofari,
[SPEAKER_00]: who had been performing personal research
on the cannabis plant for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neil Sturman contacted some friends at
American Music and secured a more adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: sound system than the one we had the first
few years, and we were on our way to
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger and better things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last chapter I'm going to read is the
arrival, 1994, and that is chapter four.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third hemp fest volunteer park had
been a success, but we knew we had taken
[SPEAKER_00]: the small amphitheater to its maximum
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A more suitable venue was needed for our
growing protest rally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was decided that we'd go back to the
place of the hemp fest inception,
[SPEAKER_00]: gasworks park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Word was getting out that there was a new
annual event in town that was boldly
[SPEAKER_00]: telling the unvarnished truth about the
insanity of America's pot laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison Chains had recently released their
Jar Flies album, which debuted at number
[SPEAKER_00]: one on the billboard charts, something no
EP had ever heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to our friend at Seattle Parks
Department, George Long, for a permit to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold hemp fest at gasworks park.
[SPEAKER_00]: George was a large man with a deep voice
and a small ponytail capping off his
[SPEAKER_00]: balding head.
[SPEAKER_00]: A secret supporter of the cause and an old
dead head.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than once, George and I had shared
more than stories as we crossed paths
[SPEAKER_00]: outside his work environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't you guys get me in trouble over
this, I recalled George saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: What trouble, we innocently replied.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no trouble lining up backs for that
year's hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticker Bush, the band I fronted for,
performed again that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The experience of being the emcee and also
performing a set of songs was so draining
[SPEAKER_00]: that I vowed never to do it again,
and I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The herbivores played, fronted by the
dreadlock Jim Matheson, the rock reggae
[SPEAKER_00]: band featured Jay Roberts on guitar,
son of a late jazz great, master Howard
[SPEAKER_00]: Roberts, and Jim's partner Cher Parker on
bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was their second time
performing at hemp fest, and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually go on to become the Seattle
Hempfest Band, which still stands today.
[SPEAKER_00]: My good friend Larry Steiner's band,
El Steiner, played on a large scaffold
[SPEAKER_00]: stage that we directed on the asphalt
blacktop in front of the old gasworks
[SPEAKER_00]: refinery structures that the peace vigil
had occupied a few years earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outrageous, flamboyant, the high energy
Larry danced like a madman and screamed
[SPEAKER_00]: like a banshee on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larry would go to dance professionally for
the band Sky Cries Mary eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle's Dindy Lyons who played as did an
ad hoc all-star group headed up by the
[SPEAKER_00]: singer of Green Apple Quickstep,
Tyler Ty Wilman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply cannot recall what they called
themselves that day as they were a
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise act and was not included in the
poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've since researched they were called My
Ty Water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ended up being hemp fest last year
without a mosh pit barrier in front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our headline act in 94 would reveal to us
the sheer power that our audience
[SPEAKER_00]: possessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bombastic female punk band Seven Year
Bitch headlined that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember the lead singer Celine
Vigil poking her head out on Larry
[SPEAKER_00]: Steiner's outrageously painted milk van
which served as the backstage green room
[SPEAKER_00]: that year and remarking, Jesus Christ,
look at all the people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were totally unprepared for the thongs
that came.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a sea of humanity in every
direction as the hot sun streaked into
[SPEAKER_00]: Gasford Park that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gridlock on the streets of the Sound
Rain neighborhoods was intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Residents coming home from their daily
commute were unable to find parking in
[SPEAKER_00]: their neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, they could even make it that far
in the back to hemp fest traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were simply people everywhere trying
to get into the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up on stage, Seven Year Bitch roared
ferociously.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were stage diving youths attempting
to springboard into the crowd from the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go up to the front along with
other volunteers to protect the
[SPEAKER_00]: sovereignty of the stage which had a
raging mosh pit in front of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy made it past us and up onto the
stage and as he went to jump into the
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd, his foot pushed into the protective
screen covering one of the monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers, essentially destroying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I positioned myself carefully and started
untying the shoelaces of anyone the crowd
[SPEAKER_00]: was trying to pass up on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while, this tactic worked fairly
well as the stage divers tried to either
[SPEAKER_00]: tie their shoes or retrieve them from the
center of the pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point, I realized that the surface
of the savage gauge was rocking back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked down to see people in the front
of the audience holding onto the edges of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plywood that was laid down as
flooring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were rocking the stage up and down
several inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember a growing feeling of alarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had wanted to, the crowd probably
possessed the ability to turn the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: thing up on its end.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point in the performance,
a fight broke out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band stopped and I took the mic and
verbally admonished the dudes fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, you guys fighting down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is community here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you fighting at our community
event?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to learn to work together if we're
going to have our end provision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please respect that by not fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crowd applauded and cheered and the
two fighters gently assimilated back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also during the show, someone started to
set up a Marlboro tent in the park,
[SPEAKER_00]: presumably to promote the cigarette brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary was enraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ran down to the booth and started
screaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way you're setting this booth up for
our event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not promoting cigarettes at Seattle
Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perpetrator of the tobacco booth
sheepishly dismantled it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared into the pot-smoked haze of
the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 4.20 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: at Hempfest that year was the first time
we really experienced what we now call the
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.20 fog rolling into our event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked as if the entire audience was on
fire because there was a thick cloud of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis smoke hovering over the entire
girth of the venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also at 4.20, Hempfest that year,
Jack Harris spoke to the audience who
[SPEAKER_00]: learned how industrial hemp had been grown
by several of America's forefathers,
[SPEAKER_00]: including George Washington and Thomas
Jefferson.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those days, Harris was energized and
his passionate speeches were equal parts
[SPEAKER_00]: history lesson and call to action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intensely focused, Jack was an unusual
character and he would talk to anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to listen about the multifaceted
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That year drew an estimated 15,000 people
and as the event grew exponentially in
[SPEAKER_00]: size and notoriety, the cost of production
and promotion grew as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary had a huge banner made that was
attached to the rear of a small plane that
[SPEAKER_00]: flew around the city promoting Hempfest in
the days prior to the event and during.
[SPEAKER_00]: The need for a larger sound system,
scaffold, staging, and hand-held radios
[SPEAKER_00]: meant we needed to generate more income
for Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We began a series of benefit shows,
many of them taking place in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs that had propelled the famous grunge
music acts of the era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle clubs like the Ditto, the
Crocodile Cafe, Rock Candy, the Off-Ramp,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the OK Hotel all opened their doors to
help raise green energy for the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the years that have followed,
hundreds of Northwest bands have
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to the fest playing gigs for
free without any promise of playing the
[SPEAKER_00]: big kahuna.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first year we had staff
shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 94, we picked up the graphic design
work of Jamie Sheen and Art Chantry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They collaborated on our famous 94
cigarette pack poster produced both on
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp paper as well as on 100% hemp burlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poster was the first of many designed
by this team to win national awards for
[SPEAKER_00]: art design and creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 94 cigarette poster won an art
director's award, a summit award,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a hemp burlap poster version is
hanging in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
[SPEAKER_00]: in Cleveland, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: After Hempfest was over, I was walking
under the large concrete arches that used
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold a large coal chute back when the
park was a petroleum refinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fellow began yelling at me to wait
for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped and this guy I'd never seen
before came running up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm from Texas, and I just decided
to walk down to the park today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, we have nothing like this where I
come from, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I want you to have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to have my Dallas Cowboys
baseball cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my prized possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cap was very soiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to explain that I was very
grateful, but I was not really a big
[SPEAKER_00]: spectator sports fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he insisted that I take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have that baseball cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an insert here from Art Chanter,
and I want to read that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This version of the 1994 poster,
Jamie and I decided, was a silk screen on
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp burlap with a slight design change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf is reversed to allow the burlap
texture to show through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie had a client that was pioneering
hemp products in America, and through him
[SPEAKER_00]: she met Vivian.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the connection to Hempfest was
made for her and then me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The burlap version was to promote the idea
that hemp is not just about smoking,
[SPEAKER_00]: as hair reminded us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp used to be the primary fiber source
in the world until the chemical industry
[SPEAKER_00]: went to war against the hemp competition,
Art Chanter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Art is really one of the most famous
living poster artists of the post-1960s
[SPEAKER_00]: era, and it's really been a pleasure to
work with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, the Hempfest poster is being
designed by Ernie Shefalu, who's designed
[SPEAKER_00]: about 20 famous album covers from Black
Sabbath to the Bee Gees, and he also was
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the creators of the Rolling Stone
Lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty excited to work with him,
and we're expanding to a Hempfest business
[SPEAKER_00]: show as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a business show at the Seattle
Center during Hempfest this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 30 days to write this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was originally complaining to my friend
and colleague, Todd McCormick,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the phone, saying, man, now I'm working
12 hours a day at Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to pay my rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Vivian, you need to write a
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, a book?
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to write a book about Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: My publisher, I'll talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he hooked me up with his publisher,
and we kind of talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, yeah, yeah, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about two and a half months before
Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, yeah, it's got to be done in 30
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, you know, spend a year
researching the book, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a year writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, yeah, it's got to be done
in three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not ready to sell Hempfest,
and then we'll figure out the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, dude, we're two months from
Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the physical impossibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know what you're asking me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hung up the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, this is an opportunity, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, a chance to tell the story
of Hempfest, a chance to pay my rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Offer me, you know, a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really can't pass this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call him back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write the book in 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I feel sorry for my lady Conti,
because I was really not fun to be around
[SPEAKER_00]: for those 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a full promotion mode with
Hempfest, which is already a full blank
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anxiety attack never stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no time for research and no time
for interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no time for fact checking or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really came right out of my memory
banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then spent about two weeks kind of
pulling all the pictures together and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out how to find high res
versions of all these thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures that we had and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just feel so fortunate, because not
everybody has a story to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of those people that do, very few
people have an opportunity to share it
[SPEAKER_00]: with folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few minutes, so I want to kind
of just open up and see if anybody has any
[SPEAKER_00]: questions or comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There hasn't been a demonstrable change,
because we acted like pot was legal at
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempfest from the very first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there was a big,
the city government was extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned at when I filed to pass that
Hempfest was going to have another 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, it's actually been slightly
less attendance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of factors to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't really noticed a big
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done some changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have worked with Dr. Roger Rothman of
the University of Washington School of
[SPEAKER_00]: Social Work Marijuana Treatment Project to
put together a series of eight cards that
[SPEAKER_00]: we call the cannabis gut check cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're mostly geared towards youth,
but they're geared towards anybody dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with marijuana and driving cannabis in
your lungs, cannabis in your brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in addiction, cannabis in teens,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling that now pot's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to really ramp up the awareness
and the education on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: potential dangers and other aspects that
people should know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we worked the last year to institute
two 21 and over smoking areas inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempfest that were fenced off out of
public view where people 20 and over could
[SPEAKER_00]: go in and really smoke legally in a public
park, which something nobody's ever done
[SPEAKER_00]: before in America that I'm aware of
because the city signed off on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've changed a few things,
but Hempfest itself really hasn't changed
[SPEAKER_00]: much since I-502 passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we're seeing as things work out
that there's just as much a need for
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempfest, just as relevant today as the
problems of I-502 and the conflicts
[SPEAKER_00]: between medical marijuana and of course,
you know, that have several people say,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Hempfest is over, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's no need to do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, excuse me, you know,
29 grams is still a misdemeanor,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 grams still a felony, you can't grow
any plants and there's 46 states where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the attendance like over the last
couple of years?
[SPEAKER_04]: Has it increased?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's the numbers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know the numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the city, the city counted,
we counted everybody at Hempfest last year
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Kent and it came out to 106,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you can have a minimum wage
security person sitting there with a deal
[SPEAKER_00]: and being able to actually accurately
count the people coming and going is
[SPEAKER_00]: really questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody really knows,
maybe the Akashic record knows how many
[SPEAKER_00]: people are at Hempfest, but a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was very briefly a volunteer and
one thing that was very interesting to me
[SPEAKER_02]: about Hempfest was suddenly it became not
just a long-haired male in a leather
[SPEAKER_02]: jacket thing, but a family thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were bringing their babies in
strollers, their kids and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whole families and I just thought that was
stunning and a really good development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder if you could say something
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, about eight years ago, a writer in
The Stranger said that Hempfest was a
[SPEAKER_00]: patchouli-stained ghetto and that it was
littered with tied eyes and prayer flags
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we were holding back the movement
and if we really wanted to take seriously,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would ban the tied eyes and the prayer
flags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I thought that was
tremendously an unfair characterization of
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempfest because you look at any photo of
the crowd and 80 to 90 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people in our crowd are completely
mainstream looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the freaky people tend to
stick out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, Hempfest has really
changed in its demographic and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people my age, a lot of people
pushing 60 there or older, people from all
[SPEAKER_00]: walks of life, a lot of people bringing
their kids, too many people bringing their
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we've deliberately,
we've been approached by all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, hey, we've got these big,
huge, puffy children things that people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we have a children's area we can
bring in, we can do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always avoided all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, while we allow people to bring
their kids, because it's a free speech
[SPEAKER_00]: event, we can't deny anybody, we don't
even need to encourage people to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: their children there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be in poor taste for a
variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing about it is, speaking of
people's ages, is we're uncomfortable with
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of youth that are smoking
openly there and not of really young
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a challenge for us to deal with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working hard as we can to try
to, I think the most effective thing is to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to educate people so that they make
their own decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a challenging thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably our political Achilles heel
is the youth that are there being exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoking or engaging in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alison?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was curious about the Pease Havens and
the current status of the Pease Havens.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pizza Havens.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, originally the Hempfest was a
project that the Pease Havens worked on
[SPEAKER_00]: about two months out of the year,
which means putting up flyers basically
[SPEAKER_00]: and then running the event and cleaning it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Hempfest grew and grew and it
got to a point where it was two months of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year we didn't work on Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, as you know, Hempfest is full
bore, 150 weeks of an entire year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Pease Havens kind of got absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hempfest just grew so large,
so omnipotent, so overwhelming that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pease Havens have kind of been sucked into
the Hempfest, absorbed into the beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that said, we're still maintaining the
crisis guide at SeattleCrisis.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big challenge to update and fact
check that stuff because Hempfest requires
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands and thousands of volunteer
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Pease Havens really exists in
spirit inside the body of the Hempfest
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably about time to have some
kind of Pease Haven reunion thing because
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we are at the, Pease Havens
started in 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting close to 30 year reunion
here coming up soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been contacted by organizers in
other states to put together Hempfests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a relevant, timely question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been contacted over the years
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have assisted many, many events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've given legal advice, advice on
permitting, physical advice, sent
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteers, emcees to a lot of events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually just started a licensing
program right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've licensed for SoCal Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking to Salem Hempfest right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Las Vegas Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually, yes, we're working with
many, many events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually have a licensing agreement
for events that want to call themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempfest that are gonna keep the community
values, the political content,
[SPEAKER_00]: voter registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna have first aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a whole list of quality
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't copyright it, but about a year
ago we got contacted by two women in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Virgin Islands saying that their former
business partner was trying to copyright
[SPEAKER_00]: the name Hempfest to rip us off
specifically, to charge us for it and deny
[SPEAKER_00]: us the use of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out that he used our logos and
our artwork he sent to trademark it for
[SPEAKER_00]: his thing, which alarmed us greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have started the process of
trademarking the event ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a very lengthy and complicated
process for something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Hempfest, Seattle and Hempfest
is almost become a word like festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't trademark festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can trademark this festival,
but not just festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working through right now trying
to trademark and protect our brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's been Hempfests,
calling ourselves Hempfest, having wet
[SPEAKER_00]: t-shirt contests and just doing stuff that
we think is not in the best interest of a
[SPEAKER_00]: community reform event, things that are
distracting and not a good mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, doing them irresponsibly
and even recklessly by not having,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, any kind of first aid,
not having water, you know, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yes, we've been working for a long
time and we'll help any pot event,
[SPEAKER_00]: any reform event that we think is going to
be done in a responsible way, but it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to have this community values component
that we think is making Hempfest so
[SPEAKER_00]: successful on this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we believe that we have the
right to use public property to air our
[SPEAKER_00]: grievances and our First Amendment and
Fourth Amendment rights to speak and
[SPEAKER_00]: gather, but we don't have a right to trash
the parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a right to, you know,
deny other people their free speech or
[SPEAKER_00]: their livelihood, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a complicated balance because
not all of the businesses down on the
[SPEAKER_00]: waterfront enjoy Hempfest happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a year-long permitting process
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The permit takes a year to secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a yoga.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yes, the short answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've helped out a lot of other events and
we want them to spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're springing up like all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are just a desire to extract
revenue and exploit this kind of new
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and some of them are so to see
your events to educate and reform and
[SPEAKER_00]: create community awareness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you found big differences in the way
the city of Seattle has handled your
[SPEAKER_01]: permit requests from one administration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never really sure where stuff's
coming from, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to be paranoid when you're using
something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times that, a lot of times I
think that we felt they're out to get us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just bureaucracy and red tape and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically, we've learned that if we
really want to know what's going on behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the scenes with our event, we have to do a
Freedom of Information Act request for
[SPEAKER_00]: documents to the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found all kinds of stuff, all kinds of
complaints that we didn't know about,
[SPEAKER_00]: issues coming from over here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find out what's being said about us
that's actually very enlightening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think they're trying to keep
stuff from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just bureaucracy and time
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys have huge jobs handling huge
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempfest is a gigantic pain in the ass for
these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that work on permitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the biggest, most complicated,
taboo, barely legal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they say, it's one of the most
loved events in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the most hated events in
the city by people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would not believe the issues and
the things that we have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time we got an emergency call from
horrible trash and garbage in front of a
[SPEAKER_00]: business during Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're outraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they called the mayor's office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they called the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally left Hempfest and went
down to there onto Elliott Avenue to check
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were seven French fries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were seven French fries in front of
their door on the sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, is this even from Hempfest?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a half a mile away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if somebody doesn't like
you, your garbage looks worse,
[SPEAKER_00]: stinks worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had Edgewater last year send
photographs to the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of a glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: A glass pipe that was actually left in one
of our elevators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's vomit in the parking lot of the
Edgewater on the weekend of Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, you had six wedding receptions
that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know it's ours, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the kind of things that we
have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try not to take it personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempfest has a huge impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know it.
So that's the kind of things that we have
to deal with.
