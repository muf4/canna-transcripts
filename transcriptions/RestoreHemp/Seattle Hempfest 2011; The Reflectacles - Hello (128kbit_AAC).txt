[SPEAKER_01]: goodbye And I'll sweat and need you I'll
give it a day And I'll be on my way

way But I'm looking for The truth that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just cannot know Maybe a place to get
sleep Or you'll pass on in a dream So take
[SPEAKER_00]: the time Going over the road And the stars
and the storms They are all that you need
