[SPEAKER_00]: We need to stop regulating based on THC
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is completely arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists have shown through their
studies that regulating based on THC is an
[SPEAKER_00]: arbitrary, especially the 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we should be doing, what I've been
advocating for, is regulating based on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid profiles, such as a THC-CPD
ratio, and that would look at the true
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactivity of the plant and the
symbiotic relationship of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and the terpenes within the
plant so that we can be using this as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant approach and using each type
of cannabis for the best use that it does
[SPEAKER_00]: have, not limiting our plant to a 0.3%
when, you know, studies have shown that
[SPEAKER_00]: the 0.3% is limiting the production of
seed and oil, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in Oregon, 2015 was our first
production season and we had nine farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest started about, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, nine farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our farmers is actually right
there, Eric Hempsey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have some issues with seed
importation this past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we only had nine of our farmers
planting, but we're looking forward to a
[SPEAKER_00]: more successful production season in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest began about three weeks ago and
some of our farmers are still harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: this week as we're going.
Very cool.
