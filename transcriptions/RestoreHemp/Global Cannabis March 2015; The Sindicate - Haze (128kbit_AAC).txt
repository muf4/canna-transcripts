[SPEAKER_01]: slowly slips away
[SPEAKER_01]: She almost made it, she was so close she
could taste it Now she lies in the valley
[SPEAKER_01]: below Just waiting for her heart to stop
It's beating for the devil to take her
[SPEAKER_01]: soul The good is poisoned, the judge is
killing me And it's hurting, that pain may
[SPEAKER_01]: know for me And when I'm stopping with
your cheap, just let me bleed Love's
[SPEAKER_01]: weapon is pointed right at me
[SPEAKER_01]: Won't you light up in place Lost in her
purple haze Life's just a masquerade Time
