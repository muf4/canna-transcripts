[SPEAKER_00]: All we talk about race and you know that
African Americans and Hispanics get
[SPEAKER_00]: arrested more than caucasians and all
classes of drug related arrests They get
[SPEAKER_00]: sent to jail more they get prosecuted more
and it's totally totally unfair and does
[SPEAKER_00]: not represent race Characterizations in
America, but what's even more subtle
[SPEAKER_00]: underlying this is privilege Some people
are allowed to use cannabis and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people are not that's all plain and simple
it is And I'm telling you all right now
[SPEAKER_00]: That if the people don't figure this stuff
out get cannabis back in their hands There
[SPEAKER_00]: is something coming down the pathway and
that's called pharmaceutical ization Okay
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a company in England that is
making a cannabis spray Okay, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: taking cannabis plants growing them up and
dissolving them in liquid carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you take
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been done since the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but these guys have figured out a
way to nicely cleanly go out with chopped
[SPEAKER_00]: up cannabis that they got from Dutch from
the Dutch seed banks, okay and then And
[SPEAKER_00]: then what happened eventually these guys
were able to make a mixture of one strain
[SPEAKER_00]: with a high THC content and one strain
with a high CBD content these strains are
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find these in US and a bunch of
states Then they went to the International
[SPEAKER_00]: Naming Board and said this is not ash oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Nabixamol This is a total
extraction and liquid carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up from straight ganja that
they've mixed up together in one to one
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio and they're calling it Nabixamol
They are allowed to import this into the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's straight up from cannabis and they're
using it in clinical trials Which is
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medicine for patients in hospitals,
but you know what they're telling the
[SPEAKER_00]: government They're saying look when you
approve our spray Leave cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one, but take our cannabis
extraction out of schedule one so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: make buku dollars so we do not have to
wait for You know compete with other
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I'm just telling you this is
coming down the pipe It's really crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crazy world of privilege.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pharmaceutical privilege over the
people's right to cultivate their own
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine if it's not if you guys don't
know about this if you if you want to if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to know part of what's called the
politics, please pay attention to this
[SPEAKER_00]: because Before you know it, you know
pharmaceutical company will have that in
[SPEAKER_00]: your bartels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it prescribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be coming down Wait, this is this is
happening under the Obama administration
[SPEAKER_00]: and Obama himself He is appointed the
major person who was responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: raiding all the cannabis dispensaries in
California as to be The head head of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug Enforcement Agency So, you know,
that's the kind of stuff if you guys want
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep seeing those kind of like
repressive politics which keeps lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: people down Keep so it keeps the privilege
politics going Don't do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of keep your little zone But if
you want to see a change if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: people to have access to this thing and
you I'm sure you all do because like
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody wants people to share The
benefits of Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 37 million year old plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Anyway, I wanted to share that with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you guys to be very excited that
you're in a place like Seattle
[SPEAKER_00]: Once a day once a year it has to be all
the time Okay, just go to one place and
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like you can be comfortable on campus
anywhere in the world It should be a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis free zone zone that's cannabis
can freely be talked about Consumed if
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate and just you know part of our
landscape like it's been forever So that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I that's what I hope to see and
anyway, I'll be back with you all next
[SPEAKER_00]: year You
