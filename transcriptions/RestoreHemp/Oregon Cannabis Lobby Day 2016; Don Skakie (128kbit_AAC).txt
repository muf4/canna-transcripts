[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, thanks for coming out
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Don Skaki.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Washington resident and currently
working at the Northwest Cannabis Cafe in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'm by state right now because
I was last Monday in the Capitol in
[SPEAKER_00]: Olympia speaking about home-grow for
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard that after encouraging comments
by the chairman that the opposition would
[SPEAKER_00]: lie in the other house, the chairman did
not even allow a vote of his own committee
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not looking good up there in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, I'm amazed at the parallels
between the two states here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be cautious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look to what's happening up there because
I see it coming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, don't be satisfied that there
are people here and there are great people
[SPEAKER_00]: here on our side that speak for you or
speak for your interests, but only you can
[SPEAKER_00]: speak for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's critically important that you do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this table over here, we have the
contact information for the committee
[SPEAKER_00]: members for implementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you need to find out if you
don't know who your legislator is,
[SPEAKER_00]: find out who your legislator is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see them in their office
here, see them in your district.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see them in your district,
see them at their town meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, look, medical cannabis is important
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work a shift up at the cafe there from 2
in the afternoon until midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, a smoke-free
environment is not good for my health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to smoke during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become obvious since we've been open,
since we opened their hemp stock weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: and each day more and more people come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's regular, everyday folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the homeless people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the people, we got a lovely young
couple that lives in a trailer that brings
[SPEAKER_00]: their friends in when they come to visit
because they've got nowhere to entertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tourists that can't smoke in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't smoke it in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't smoke it in your hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't maybe smoke it in your
housing because it's federally funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you just don't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got another couple that comes in
because they don't want to smoke around
[SPEAKER_00]: their kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The social aspect of cannabis is strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the strongest highs amongst
all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to go out and enjoy each
other socially in an alcohol-free
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and leave knowing that we're
all safe and happy is just astounding to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that they want to shut us
down, I mean, it's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's freaking cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to go to our club right now,
the OHA rules is you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, fortunately, we've been vested in
the club and built an outdoor area that's
[SPEAKER_00]: covered with some heaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nice, but it's not indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like the beauty of the club
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make the adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to remember these legislators
are just regular folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not experts in all the issues that
come before them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look upon the public to educate them
on what's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the lobbyists get their
ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you come down here,
you have to take time off of work or time
[SPEAKER_00]: away from your family or travel here at
expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When somebody's paying you to be a
lobbyist, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get up in the morning, put on your
suit and tie, hop in the car, put some gas
[SPEAKER_00]: in the car, and away you go because you've
been paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we need us each to pay ourselves
forward by speaking to our legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, please, if you're not informed on
these issues, we do have the information
[SPEAKER_00]: of the committee members.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know who represents you,
find out who represents you and see them
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But find out the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speak for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only do so much on your behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got to carry the ball the rest of
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
Thank you.
