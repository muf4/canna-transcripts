[SPEAKER_01]: We got the Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the Jack man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the Jack man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make some noise for Jack Herrera,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly without the book... Hold on a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: One second, Papa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly without the book, the Emperor wears
no clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very few people really know what's going
on right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an awesome book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every ganja smoker should have this book
in their house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when someone's up in your house telling
you, you pull out the book and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: read, and then come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can chat to me after you read the
book, because they're gonna get their
[SPEAKER_01]: minds blown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go out and support this book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also advise everyone in this
creation to read the words of His Majesty,
[SPEAKER_01]: the autobiographies of Haile Selassie and
the collected speeches of Haile Selassie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be astounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be amazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your whole life will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will see what Rastafari is dealing
with and what Rastafari is truly,
[SPEAKER_01]: really about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a wonderful man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the most wonderful man I've ever seen
and I ever known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love my father and I love my mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is no disrespect to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither my grandfather, neither my
grandmother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Haile Selassie is from the end of
days until no more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: See?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's from creation, and he's the
living jar upon this earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haile Selassie, haile jar!
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastafari!
[SPEAKER_00]: Music, man!
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in session!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha ha ha!
[SPEAKER_01]: Love me on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: People.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put up your one, you'll have sense in you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the weak part of your culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it in a bamboo, roll it in a
brisla.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it in a filly, in a Dutch master.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smoke it in a pipe, put it in a
chalwa.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what you do, you just love the
ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: The West Coast to Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York back to West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico, South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam across the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hard yard will come from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch me, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a one drop, papa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Escort service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a proper one drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hard yard will come from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't you need that you got some black
ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ain't Hawaii, it ain't Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ain't China, India, Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polo!
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Isis!
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, make some noise for Ponyboy and those
marihuanos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know all the bands and all the
groups that played.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not like I'm forgetting anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just I'm going to pick up who I
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make some noise for the herbivores,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make some noise for humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really wonderful show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I knew everyone's name,
I would name everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to know everyone
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the best situation to
travel the world and to make Brejian and
[SPEAKER_01]: Sistin with everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
