[SPEAKER_00]: So 2015, July 1st, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna make it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russ talked about all the areas that we've
got to make better and Russ has actually
[SPEAKER_00]: got my banner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Russ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone in the course of my career,
I've been doing marijuana politics,
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana policy, and marijuana law for
the last 15 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone in the course of my career from
doing almost exclusively criminal defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day I would wake up and deal with
somebody who had gotten busted,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who had had to talk to the
police, somebody who had a friend in jail,
[SPEAKER_00]: a parent in jail, a child in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many people every day who
came to me because somebody was in jail,
[SPEAKER_00]: was in custody, was facing court,
was facing jail, was facing prison,
[SPEAKER_00]: was facing trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you today, I have less than 10
criminal cases right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the work I do at this point isn't
for people who are looking at going to
[SPEAKER_00]: prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for people who are looking at opening
a business, paying their taxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: being an above board member of society who
can walk into an establishment and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I'm in the marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that change in the last 15 years has
been monumental.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when people, even mentioning
the word marijuana, people would walk away
[SPEAKER_00]: from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would literally distance themselves
from you in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day I was on a flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was coming back from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was coming back from the High Times
Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone on the plane said,
hey, I think someone has a skunk on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And called a flight attendant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very nice older lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, I think there's a skunk on
the plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gentleman behind her started
laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about half the plane started laughing
because almost everyone on that flight was
[SPEAKER_00]: coming back from Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Cup to Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flight attendant looked around and
she said, now, it's illegal to have
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana on the plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure that everyone who had
marijuana back in Denver left it in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all went, yes, flight attendant,
of course we left our marijuana back in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone explained to this very nice
lady, that's what marijuana smelled like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all went about our day and laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No air marshal jumped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was in handcuffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was on the ground being searched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was detained from the flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those things happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 10 years ago, all those things would
have been happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to tell you today, I am so happy
to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so happy to have spent time,
effort, and energy with all of you
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful people getting to where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so happy that moving forward,
we're going to make things better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization is going to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization is going to get better each
and every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to require each and every
one of you who's here today to do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that we've been doing for years and
years and decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's stand up and say, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're responsible, productive members of
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: We choose to use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may use that instead of something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may drink a beer and have a joint
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for everybody who wants to be a
responsible adult marijuana consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what freedom is going to look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to look like a world where you
don't have to look over your shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to look like a world where you
don't have to call me at 3 AM and have
[SPEAKER_00]: someone bail you out of jail because you
had 29 grams instead of 28.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a felony last year, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: A felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: That meant that you were a felon for a
very long time in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were on probation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were paying fines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were paying in a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of July 1, you're going to have a half
pound of marijuana in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with Russ 100%, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think marijuana consumers should be
treated equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should have the same rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to take some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also need to remember,
there are places in this country where
[SPEAKER_00]: eight ounces of marijuana will send you to
fucking prison, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be in a place where
that's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've got to do is we've got to
work here to make it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of us, and I don't know if
you know this, but given I'm wearing a
[SPEAKER_00]: seersucker suit, you might have guessed
I'm from the South.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm originally from North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are places where marijuana is still
deeply illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of marijuana that you're
allowed to possess in this state can send
[SPEAKER_00]: you to prison for the rest of your natural
life in the state of Mississippi,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: No parole, no probation, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to prison, and you're staying
there for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for everyone who's lived here,
everyone who's grown up here, everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's worked so hard here, whenever you
talk to someone who's not from here,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you explain to them that it's
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's workable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw Oklahoma and Georgia both pass
medical marijuana bills this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma, Georgia, both southern states,
states that we did not expect to see any
[SPEAKER_00]: traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not perfect bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to pretend they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But change does not come in one fell
swoop, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are made day by day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plaza was not made by every single
one of these bricks instantly
[SPEAKER_00]: materializing in front of us, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: This plaza was made by people one brick at
a time putting these bricks in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way that we move forward,
the only way that we make this happen is
[SPEAKER_00]: that each and every one of us works each
day to make things a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day I wake up, and I deal with
marijuana law.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a day of my life that I have
not thought about or dealt with marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not asking everybody here to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not asking everybody here to be an
activist every single day for eight hours
[SPEAKER_00]: a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can be an activist for five
minutes a day, even something as simple as
[SPEAKER_00]: calling your elected representative when
you're listening to Russ's show,
[SPEAKER_00]: something as simple as sending an email
once a week, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't do that, donate some
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on your credit card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it an automatic deposit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it an automatic every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it worth to be able to walk down
the street, have an ounce of marijuana in
[SPEAKER_00]: your pocket, and never have to think about
a cop arresting you ever again,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, there are still things that can
get you arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are still crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people I represent,
most of the cases I deal with,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are high level cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the sort of cases that most of
you will never contemplate, will never
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: But frankly, if you've ever bought
marijuana on the black market or you've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever received marijuana, it had to come
from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone had to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone had to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of people who've been
taking a lot of risks over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those people are the people I
represent and the people I still
[SPEAKER_00]: represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I want to remind everybody of
is how to be safe, how to stay out of
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure most of you have seen one of my
cards or one of my lighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen Paul's card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen Paul's lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to remind everybody of
what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because frankly, even if you do have a
legal amount of marijuana in your pocket,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't mean you've got to consent to a
police search.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean you've got to talk to him
or deal with him if you don't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell people, remember to be
polite, and we're going to go through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So am I free to go, officer?
Am I free to go, officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am being detained.
If I am being detained.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not consent to any searches.
I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to speak to my attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to speak to my attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to answering any questions.
Prior to answering any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give these away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put myself out of business every day,
and that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day I hope to not have to do this for
criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to be doing this for law abiding
citizens who want to make the world a
[SPEAKER_00]: better place and share with their
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a lighter, grab them from the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them away for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
I give them away for free.
Thank you.
