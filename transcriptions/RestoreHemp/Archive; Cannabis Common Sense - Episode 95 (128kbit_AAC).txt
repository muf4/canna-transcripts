[SPEAKER_00]: Video taped at the studios of City Video,
it is time for Cannabis Common Sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: the show that tells you the truth about
marijuana and the politics behind its
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here's the host of your show,
Paul Stanford and Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our show is a production of our political
committee, the campaign for the
[SPEAKER_04]: restoration and regulation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our political committee is the sponsor of
a petition drive that is now in full
[SPEAKER_04]: swing, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are the three chief petitioners.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Paul Stanford.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Dr. Philip LeVec.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks folks for tuning in,
as Paul said, for another exciting edition
[SPEAKER_02]: of our show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Paul, what is our topic for this week?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to talk about hemp B.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: and the situation that's developed,
at least during the first part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: show, before we go on to some news.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up at Hemp B.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: in Vancouver, British Columbia,
some of you may recall, we did a series of
[SPEAKER_04]: interviews that were over a month of shows
last year, where Paul Loney and myself and
[SPEAKER_04]: our producer went up to Vancouver,
British Columbia and interviewed Mark
[SPEAKER_04]: Emory, Sister Icy, and some other people
that worked at, and work currently,
[SPEAKER_04]: do at Hemp B.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are going to play a bit of the
interview that we didn't get into the show
[SPEAKER_04]: last year when we covered that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't use this interview where Mark
Emory actually was across the street from
[SPEAKER_04]: the two businesses he started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I should give everybody a little
background of what went on and what's
[SPEAKER_02]: leading into today's situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: As probably a lot of you know,
Mark Emory was the founder of the Hemp B
[SPEAKER_02]: .C.
[SPEAKER_02]: empire that's known up there, and he
started off with a magazine, Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada, which is now called Cannabis
Culture, and it's still a very good
[SPEAKER_02]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also had a seed sale store that he
founded, and he does that by mail order
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he founded an outlet store for
hemp clothing and smoking accessories,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a little restaurant next door to that,
which was called Cannabis Cafe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which had all sorts of delicious food and
beverages that had hemp involved in the
[SPEAKER_02]: preparation of it some way, from cannabis,
coffee, a mixture of coffee and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: into a nice hot beverage, vegetarian
burgers with hemp seed in it, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp seed oil, and I thought it was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think, Paul?
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the food was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was homemade, fresh, using fresh
organic ingredients, and hemp seed oil,
[SPEAKER_04]: and just to be clear, it's about
everything, and hemp seed meal,
[SPEAKER_04]: which adds a kind of a nutty flavor and a
texture to the food when the hulls of the
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp seed are present.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a very nice atmosphere up
there, very low-key.
[SPEAKER_02]: People there were respectful of each
other, of the city itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, they didn't have people
congregating out front, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking like derelicts or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was just like, if you walk by
on the street, you think there's two more
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses in the middle of, you know,
urban Vancouver doing a really good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there on West Hastings Street,
folks, if you get up that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely recommend you check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right near the Gaslight District,
or it might actually be in the Gaslight
[SPEAKER_02]: District.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the actual boundaries,
but it's on West Hastings, and recently,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark Emery started all this business,
and because he'd become such a
[SPEAKER_02]: high-profile person, and was always
challenging the authorities, taking on
[SPEAKER_02]: large ads when the heads of states came
into Vancouver, B.C., and invited them all
[SPEAKER_02]: down to enjoy a nice bowl at his
restaurant, that the government felt they
[SPEAKER_02]: had a crack down on him, because he was
too high-profile, and he was very
[SPEAKER_02]: media-friendly, very photogenic,
very quotable person, as you'll see in the
[SPEAKER_02]: interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went after him, and they had a lot of
phony, they had rage when they came in,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they would haul out his inventory
worth thousands of dollars, $10,000,
[SPEAKER_02]: and had it all locked up, which is his
money, and he had employees, and he had to
[SPEAKER_02]: put out of work, and he finally,
you know, had a deal with the authorities
[SPEAKER_02]: up there that he would sell his
businesses, the hemp B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: store, and a cannabis cafe store,
and his law center that he started,
[SPEAKER_02]: to protect people who were busted for
growing or possession.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would sell those three businesses to
the folks who were running, actually
[SPEAKER_02]: running the businesses, for him,
and he would get out of that totally,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he would just be into himself,
his magazine, and his seed sales,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so that's where it was last,
this was about two years ago, that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: it was last year, after visiting,
and you'll see Mark Emery talking about it
[SPEAKER_02]: as part of that deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't allowed on that block where his
shops were.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we interviewed him outdoors
across the street from there, and from
[SPEAKER_02]: that point, Sister Icy took over the hemp
B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: store, and I don't remember who was
actually running the cafe at that time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but... His name was Mark, but I can't
recall his last name.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then that's where it was, and then in
the meantime, Sister Icy had to apply for
[SPEAKER_02]: a business license, since it was a
transfer ownership, and she had a
[SPEAKER_02]: temporary license, and the city said,
okay, we're going to make you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, go through all these hoops,
because even after she came and took it
[SPEAKER_02]: over, they raided the place twice,
claimers on her age used in their smoking,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they had to remove the vaporizers from
the cafe part of it, and so she was going
[SPEAKER_02]: through a lot of hassle, having to spend a
lot of money on hiring lawyers to defend
[SPEAKER_02]: her right to have a legitimate business,
selling clothing and smoking accessories.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were still not owned by the same
person, but the cannabis cafe was next
[SPEAKER_04]: door.
[SPEAKER_04]: While we were there, they just pulled the
vaporizers off of each of the tabletops,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they...
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, at this point, they've made it a
members only club, where you have to come
[SPEAKER_04]: in and become a member before you can
actually go into the cannabis cafe and eat
[SPEAKER_04]: and perhaps smoke there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right around the corner, there's
another store called Little Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_04]: and since then, they've been busted once.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just in late April, across the
street, another business has opened up
[SPEAKER_04]: that sells marijuana this time now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hip BC sold marijuana seeds, but never
actually sold marijuana, per se,
[SPEAKER_04]: at the store, where this new business
directly across the street there on West
[SPEAKER_04]: Hastings sells marijuana for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you can state your medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So someone with our show was up there just
recently as we're taping, and they went
[SPEAKER_04]: in, said they had migraines, got some
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty easy to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like here in Oregon with our
ballot measure 67, you have to have your
[SPEAKER_04]: physician fill out a whole raft of new
forms that they've just come up with and
[SPEAKER_04]: put down an application fee before you get
a picture ID there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just go in and immediately access
marijuana and buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, under our bill, no sales are
allowed, so the patients have to grow it
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves, and that's often very
difficult for a wheelchair-bound MS
[SPEAKER_04]: patient or someone undergoing chemotherapy
for cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can go in and talk a bit about
Sister Icy's current problems and what
[SPEAKER_02]: happened up there with her business
license, appealed to city council,
[SPEAKER_02]: because they denied her, and she had to
appeal to city council.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can run the video, Mark, first.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and run that video.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's four and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a real good interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right across the street from Mark's
store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, he'll explain all that in the
tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they'll give you a good history,
and we can update it when we get back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So roll the tape, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here with Mark Emery across the
street from Hemp B.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: and Cannabis Cafe.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a street you can't cross?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a famous place.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the cafe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a quarter million dollars that fine
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now at least get good reviews in New York
Times and Rolling Stone and other places
[SPEAKER_03]: on the Hemp B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: store.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to call it the Hemp B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: Superstore.
[SPEAKER_03]: The little grow shop was downstairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: upstairs, the cafe on the one side.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were also residents of the second and
third floors.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were building a Montessori school.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Hemp B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: Montessori school is being built on the
third floor, and the second floor is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be where Cannabis Canada magazine is
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they cancel our licenses,
we cancel all those programs, but we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to have a school incorporated there
for the children of our staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we had a lot of wonderful fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: We employed 43 people full-time up till
the end of January.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, basically 30 people are
still kept, but only nine under my actual
[SPEAKER_03]: employment now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are run by their own new owners.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it like divesting yourself of
your babies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was sad for a couple of weeks,
but you get to accept everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this world, I've learned not to be too
concerned about property or things like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Women property, they all come and go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to enjoy the process by which
they've come and gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to that degree, I'm really happy with
what we've done, not necessarily happy
[SPEAKER_03]: with what I've ended up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a very, you know... Well,
the end isn't here yet, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully there'll be a happy ending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's still a happy ending.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of happy endings every day,
and there's always tragedies and things
[SPEAKER_03]: that get in the way and obstacles,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the inevitable process of living.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just can't be... Got to be courageous
and face up to them and not be cowardly
[SPEAKER_03]: and look at our obligations straight in
the face and go ahead and do the work that
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not allowed to go across the
street, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot leave this park and go that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is after they raid you the second
time?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is after two Americans went back
and claimed they gave them $5 worth of
[SPEAKER_03]: hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that was held around for a couple
of months until they decided they wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to keep me away from that block.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Rolling Stone article just came out
and they did not want... They wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: torture me by having all these people come
to find me and look for me, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed to meet them, type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not allowed... So you had to
sell your business as you came and go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I had to sell them next to
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's only to my employees,
so they're run by people who understand
[SPEAKER_03]: how to run them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you kept the debt?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I kept the debt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they didn't even put any money down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just paid me on a weekly basis like a
salaried employee for five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so I'm busy paying off the debt
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the debt's not that bad,
all things considered.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only about $100,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll pay that down in a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to challenge the
restriction of going to the store?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, the police want that so bad that
if I just unload, they just charge me with
[SPEAKER_03]: something else and get the judge to do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you have to learn to play ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like I said, anywhere in the
United States I'd be in jail for 20 years
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Canadians have learned... They'll
put up with me to some degree,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the establishment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, they can play hardball when
they want, but they also like to send
[SPEAKER_03]: messages in lieu of any really big action.
[SPEAKER_03]: And despite what it would appear to me,
like you're losing $400,000 worth of
[SPEAKER_03]: inventory over four years in two raids,
it's pretty big, but to them that's just a
[SPEAKER_03]: message.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the street and were those
buildings occupied before you moved in
[SPEAKER_02]: there?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the one where Camps Cafe was actually
empty.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one where MPC is was where the Eastern
Art stores moved over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cabbages and Kinks was new.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was abandoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other building down there that was
rebuilt, it was abandoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Across the street where the MPC Legal
Assistance Center is now was a firebombed
[SPEAKER_03]: building.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the buildings adjacent to it were
abandoned, including this old bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the block is, you know,
completely filled up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's anchored around our businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We certainly draw the bulk of people
coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cabbages and Kinks Basics, the place
across the street, the restaurants in the
[SPEAKER_03]: area.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they say, you know,
when you talk about public safety,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need people around.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people around going in our business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we used to patrol the streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to have our own private police
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nothing bad that was going to
happen on the street when we ran it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had people patrolling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had private cops, everything,
our own people, all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very nicely organized block.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they say, you know,
if you have a public, it's safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's when a place is abandoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, no, no, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just right over across the
street here, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, you can see what decay looks
like that way, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've heard all of your neighbors
really love you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope you enjoyed that interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it kind of illustrates some of the
crazy insanity that our drug war can lead
[SPEAKER_04]: us to, and in particular with Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to update them on the story of
what's happened with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we had one with Sister Icy,
the woman who Mark Emory sold the store
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was forced to sell the store to get out
of his legal problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was running the store, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came in a couple of times and raided.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hauled off some of her inventory
once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they charged her at one point,
meanwhile, like I said, back up a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: here, she was applying for a business
license and she had to go in front of the
[SPEAKER_02]: city council because the licensing bureau
was recommending denial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the meantime, one of the times
when they had to bust her, they charged
[SPEAKER_02]: her with what's the term they have up
there, was facilitating the use of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, you know, legal substance by
actually selling these smoking devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: They charged her, it's almost an
equivalent of like delivery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty serious charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was fighting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, she went after them
saying that they had unlawfully seized her
[SPEAKER_02]: property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was a stay or nothing in the
court system there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sister Icy's claimed that they had made a
deal where they would drop the charge of
[SPEAKER_02]: her facilitating use of cannabis,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_02]: by selling these products, and she would
drop her claim of them seizing her
[SPEAKER_02]: property, in going for damages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that couldn't be brought up at the
city council permit process, the process
[SPEAKER_02]: of her being charged with contributing to
the use of cannabis who's selling these
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when a hearing came from the city
council, they had different hearings.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor had to recuse himself because he
stayed on the first hearing that these
[SPEAKER_02]: people would be gone by Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had to recuse himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, he was backstage pulling
strings for the temporary mayor,
[SPEAKER_02]: the vice mayor, who was sitting there in
the chair, writing the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought all these up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these charges alleging that she was
contributing to the use of cannabis by
[SPEAKER_02]: selling these products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her lawyers did a good job of complaining
and saying it shouldn't be allowed to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: this evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council didn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they went on, you know,
the city attorney was saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing up all the old horror stories
that we've all heard about through all the
[SPEAKER_02]: years that cannabis, you know,
leads from everything, from your hair
[SPEAKER_02]: falling out to, you know, murder of
innocent children.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, even the city council had to
cut them off because the city attorney was
[SPEAKER_02]: going so far off the deep end on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they voted unanimously to deny her
license, saying that she is contributing
[SPEAKER_02]: to the delinquency of Canadian miners,
Vancouver's miners, by not, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: carting people who come into her store to
shop, and by selling to anybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to anybody and everybody,
and that there was open smoking going on
[SPEAKER_02]: in her store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out at one point that a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marine and a Royal Canadian Mounted Police
went in undercover to the store and were,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, asking for marijuana in the
store, claiming that they had health
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were saying that therefore that's
one of the reasons that because she was
[SPEAKER_02]: selling to a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marine and a Royal Canadian Mounted Police
that they should close her down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they came after her, and so they
voted to deny it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's appealing now to the court system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the belief that she can temporarily
keep her store open.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if she moves in court, she will have
to sell the store to somebody else,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they go through all the print
process, or they close the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And meanwhile, she's run up a large legal
bill up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, you know, and they use little
snippets of her talking about how she uses
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, you know, for her medical
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she thinks there's a great medical
benefit in how her children are all
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use these little words, just little
tiny snippets from interviews she's given,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the one she gave in our show years,
you know, last year, but saying that she
[SPEAKER_02]: believes in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, oh, that makes her evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: In any case, that's where it stands.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another sad story of government
oppression up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just find it interesting that he had
a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marine go undercover up there under what
authority, I'd like to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll have to try and dig into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they couldn't use the military
and law enforcement here in the United
[SPEAKER_04]: States.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see how they could send them into
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a different country.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Marines are invading Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a different country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So up there, maybe they're, you know,
they somehow are trying to claim that they
[SPEAKER_02]: were undermining the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: military or something by selling cannabis
to folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not quite sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you think that, you know,
they'd be up there undermining the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: military by selling cannabis to people,
or?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they'd be undermining the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Army or Marine Corps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Undermine that mindset that cannabis is
evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, strange thing about it is that
cannabis has been used not only as a food
[SPEAKER_01]: product, but also as a medical product for
perhaps 5000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Thomas Jefferson in George Washington
grew cannabis in the early days of this
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mostly used for making of rope and
cloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I'll bet some of
those dudes were smoking some of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff because it had been smoked for
thousands of years in Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's a paper in Jefferson's
papers from Gouverneur Morris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gouverneur Morris, according to James
Madison, Madison, who we could call the
[SPEAKER_04]: father of the Constitution, wrote that the
style, quote, the style and finish of the
[SPEAKER_04]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Constitution properly belongs to the pen
of Gouverneur Morris, end quote.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Morris, while he was the ambassador to
France, just following up after Jefferson
[SPEAKER_04]: was ambassador to France, while Jefferson
was secretary of state for Washington,
[SPEAKER_04]: Morris sent this paper called Notes
Respecting Tobacco to Jefferson that he
[SPEAKER_04]: wrote for publication in France.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that paper, he compared tobacco and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he, out of the paper, was actually
discouraging the cultivation of tobacco by
[SPEAKER_04]: the French.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he compared tobacco and cannabis and
said, they called it Indian hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, hemp is at all times to be
preferred in a populous country.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they were comparing
tobacco and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I have my bias toward
thinking it's because they were both
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think anything that I found
anyway verifies that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's an interesting follow up on your
comment about Jefferson and Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sure, you know, at the very
least because both were grown in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they both were trying to, you know,
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: was trying to make sure that they could
succeed financially as a country.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that they were, you know,
cut off from Britain and were on their own
[SPEAKER_02]: as an independent country, they had to
have something, you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: trades, some things they needed to import.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you've got to remember,
you know, it's not like today where the U
[SPEAKER_02]: .S.
[SPEAKER_02]: has a giant financial power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't that big of a financial power.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a backwater colonial outpost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at that time, you know,
I mean, Britain and France were it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world as far as financial power is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then probably, you know, part of the
Austrian Empire was maybe third.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere near the Russian Empire,
so.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in fact, in the American colonies
prior to independence, the British
[SPEAKER_04]: required that all colonists who had 40
acres or more of land had to put 10% of
[SPEAKER_04]: their land under cultivation for hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that 10% of hemp cultivation was their
taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was how they paid their taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the British would do is they'd take
that hemp and they'd use it to make the
[SPEAKER_04]: sails and the rigging for their ships.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'd also create what we call oakum,
which is the cock that went between the
[SPEAKER_04]: boards to make sure the water didn't seep
in when they were out at sea.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they found that hemp rigging and sails
lasted three times longer than any
[SPEAKER_04]: alternative such as cotton.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you're at sea for six months and
your sails fall apart, you're in big
[SPEAKER_04]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rather surprised to hear that oakum
was made out of hemp because during World
[SPEAKER_01]: War II, I worked in shipyards and they
were making barges and they were driving
[SPEAKER_01]: oakum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oakum into the seams between the boards
and then they would seal them with
[SPEAKER_01]: creosote pitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the strange thing about it is that the
oakum had the odor of creosote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know where the stuff came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be surprised if it was cannabis
hemp at all, but just like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what that stuff was,
but I didn't think anybody was smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want you to know it was
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want anybody trying that,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what we used this stuff for because
it had this creosote on it is we used to
[SPEAKER_01]: put it in the band of our hats to keep the
mosquitoes away because of the creosote
[SPEAKER_01]: pitch that it had on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that worked real great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a World War II veteran.
[SPEAKER_04]: You walked into Germany, I think,
for several months, you said, on some of
[SPEAKER_04]: our previous shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then after that, you went to medical
school and started your medical career
[SPEAKER_04]: here at the University of Oregon Medical
School?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I taught in medical schools for 22 years
and I practiced medicine outside for
[SPEAKER_01]: another 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: These folks here won't brag about
themselves as much as I think they should,
[SPEAKER_04]: but Dr. Lavek is a retired professor of
pharmacology and toxicology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul Loney here is an attorney and you
were the secretary of the Green Party,
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe, or the Pacific Party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're Pacific Greens.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Pacific Greens, correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And president of the Oregon Wildlife
Federation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I should probably throw in that those
other groups are not affiliated and don't
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily agree with the points of our
TV show, Cannabis Common Sense,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I thought I'd mention that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know in the past, the Pacific
Party, which is now the Pacific Greens,
[SPEAKER_02]: has endorsed the past versions of the
Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in May, at the May convention,
for the Pacific Greens, they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: take up the endorsement of the new
Cannabis Tax Act, the one for the year
[SPEAKER_02]: 2000, which we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many signatures do we need for that
one?
[SPEAKER_04]: 66,748 valid registered Oregon voter
signatures are needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's 10.5% less than were needed
over the last four years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because of the low turnout in the
gubitorial race last November,
[SPEAKER_04]: 1998.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need a buffer, though, more than
that, about 30%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to turn in roughly 90 to 95,000
registered Oregon voter signatures to
[SPEAKER_04]: ensure qualification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what I'm shooting for is that we
have 100,000 signatures when we turn it
[SPEAKER_02]: in, 100,000 raw signatures, the ones that
we've gone through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, get rid of the ones that
people didn't throw out correctly in Ron
[SPEAKER_02]: County, whatever, not completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But 100,000 raw signatures, and I think
that'll take us there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a viable goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good number to keep on our heads,
to keep that positive focus that people
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about, to think positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I say, May 15, Pacific Green
Party, we'll be voting on it to endorse
[SPEAKER_02]: it, well, and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the American Anti-Prohibition
League has endorsed the Okta for the year
[SPEAKER_02]: 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure other groups are lining up
right now as we speak, as this is being
[SPEAKER_02]: aired, to endorse this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year, we met with the Oregon Retail
Liquor Association, and they voted 17 to 8
[SPEAKER_04]: to endorse Okta, if we put in a clause
that would guarantee them a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've done that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've given them a 15% commission on their
sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a reasonable commission.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too high or too low.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're hoping that they're going to
vote again to re-endorse our initiative,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Libertarian Party.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to remind viewers, it's kind of a
lot later than we normally give this plug,
[SPEAKER_04]: but please call us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please call us, and let us send you our
petition.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act
petition will tax and regulate the sales
[SPEAKER_04]: of marijuana to adults in Oregon state
liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will license farmers to grow the drug
for sales to the Oregon Liquor Control
[SPEAKER_04]: Commission.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Oregon Liquor Control Commission will
place it in pharmacies in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially other states at cost,
where it won't be taxed, but then the
[SPEAKER_04]: sales to adults over the age of 21 through
state liquor stores will be taxed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will also allow adults to grow their
own and the sales of all strains and seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: and starts of cannabis will not be
regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, it will also allow farmers
without a license to cultivate industrial
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp for canvas, rope, lace, linen,
and all the 50,000 plus products that
[SPEAKER_04]: industrial hemp can produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just in closing, I think we'll talk
about it some more in a future show,
[SPEAKER_04]: but in North Dakota, North Dakota has
become the first state to legalize
[SPEAKER_04]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let Oregon follow that lead and call us
at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've just got over our first thousand
signatures as we're taping here in late
[SPEAKER_04]: April.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need 100,000 more, 99,000 more,
as Paul was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need your help to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call us, let us send you that petition,
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, and come down and see us at the
Portland Saturday Market every Saturday
[SPEAKER_02]: and also at the Eugene Saturday Market if
you're watching us in the Eugene area.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to get down that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the true location where we're
always at, where something happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's raining, we're not going to go
down and set up because we don't have the
[SPEAKER_04]: rain tarps and it's not productive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's a sunny day, we'll definitely
be down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So come on down to the Saturday Market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank Sunny and thank Oregon Campus Tax
Act for the year 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100,000 signatures, 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our petition drive is in full swing,
so let's send that to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming again, Dr. Lavec,
and we'll have you back for the next few
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.
Good night.
